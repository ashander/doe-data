           <p><strong><a name="central_chiller"></a>Central chiller:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any centrally located air conditioning system that produces chilled water in order to cool air. The chilled water or cold air is then distributed throughout the building, using pipes or air ducts or both. These systems are also commonly known as "chillers," "centrifugal chillers," "reciprocating chillers," or "absorption chillers." Chillers are generally located in or just outside the building they serve. Buildings receiving district chilled water are served by chillers located at central physical plants.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="central_cooling"></a>Central cooling:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooling of an entire building with a refrigeration unit to condition the air. Typically central chillers and duct work are present in the centrally cooled building.</p>

           <p><strong><a name="chained_dollars"></a>Chained dollars:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A measure used to express real prices. Real prices are those that have been adjusted to remove the effect of changes in the purchasing power of the dollar; they usually reflect buying power relative to a reference year. Prior to 1996, real prices were expressed in constant dollars, a measure based on the weights of goods and services in a single year, usually a recent year. In 1996, the U.S. Department of Commerce introduced the chained-dollar measure. The new measure is based on the average weights of goods and services in successive pairs of years. It is "chained" because the second year in each pair, with its weights, becomes the first year of the next pair. The advantage of using the chained-dollar measure is that it is more closely related to any given period covered and is therefore subject to less distortion over time.</p>

           <p><strong><a name="coal_anal"></a>Coal analysis:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Determines the composition and properties of coal so it can be ranked and used most effectively.  <ul> <li> <b>Proximate analysis,</b> determines, on an as-received basis, the      moisture content, volatile matter (gases released when coal is heated), fixed carbon (solid fuel left after the volatile matter is driven off), and ash (impurities consisting of silica, iron,      alumina, and other incombustible matter). The moisture content affects the ease with which coal can be handled and burned. The amount of volatile matter and fixed carbon provides guidelines for determining the intensity of the heat produced. Ash increases the  weight of coal, adds to the cost of handling, and can cause problems such as clinkering and slagging in boilers and furnaces.    </li> <li> <b>Ultimate analysis</b> determines the amount of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Heating value is determined in terms      of Btu, both on an as received basis (including moisture) and on a  dry basis.    </li> <li> <b>Agglomerating</b> refers to coal that softens when heated and forms a  hard gray coke; this coal is called caking coal. Not all caking coals are coking coals. The agglomerating value is used to differentiate between coal ranks and also is a guide to determine how a particular coal reacts in a furnace.    </li> <li> <b>Agglutinating</b> refers to the binding qualities of a coal. The agglutinating value is an indication of how well a coke made from  a particular coal will perform in a blast furnace. It is also called a caking index.    </li> <li> <b>Other tests</b> include the determination of the ash softening temperature, the ash fusion temperature (the temperature at which the ash forms clinkers or slag), the free swelling index (a guide to a coal's coking characteristics), the Gray King test (which determines the suitability of coal for making coke), and the Hardgrove grindability index (a measure of the ease with which coal can be pulverized). In a petrographic analysis, thin sections of coal or highly polished blocks of coal are studied with a microscope to determine the physical composition, both for scientific purposes and for estimating the rank and coking potential.</li> </ul></p>

           <p><strong><a name="coal_prep"></a>Coal preparation:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of sizing and cleaning coal to meet market specifications by removing impurities such as rock, sulfur, etc. It may include crushing, screening, or mechanical cleaning.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_preparation"></a>Coal Preparation Processes (Cleaning/Beneficiation/Processing):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In its broadest sense, preparation is any processing of mined coal to prepare it for market, including crushing and screening or sieving the coal to reach a uniform size, which normally results in removal of some non-coal or waste material. The term coal preparation most commonly refers to processing, including crushing and screening, passing the material through one or more processes to remove impurities, sizing the product, and loading for shipment. Many of the processes separate rock, clay, and other minerals from coal in a liquid medium; hence, the term washing is widely used.  In some cases, coal passes through a drying step before loading.  See <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=C#coal_washing">Coal Washing</a>.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_prod_dist"></a>Coal producing districts:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A classification of coal fields defined in the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937. The districts were originally established to aid in formulating minimum prices of bituminous and subbituminous coal and lignite. Because much statistical information was compiled in terms of these districts, their use for statistical purposes has continued since the abandonment of that legislation in 1943. District 24 was added for the anthracite-producing district in Pennsylvania.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_prod"></a>Coal production:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of sales, mine consumption, issues to miners, and issues to coke, briquetting, and other ancillary plants at mines.

           <p><strong><a name="coal_rank"></a>Coal rank:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The classification of coals according to their degree of progressive alteration from lignite to anthracite. In the United States, the standard ranks of coal include lignite, subbituminous coal, bituminous coal, and anthracite and are based on fixed carbon, volatile matter, heating value, and agglomerating (or caking) properties.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_samp"></a>Coal sampling:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection and proper storage and handling of a relatively small quantity of coal for laboratory analysis. Sampling may be done for a wide range of purposes, such as: coal resource exploration and assessment, characterization of their serves or production of a mine, to characterize the results of coal cleaning processes, to monitor coal shipments or receipts for adherence to coal quality contract specifications, or to subject a coal to specific combustion or reactivity tests related to the customer's intended use. During pre-development phases, such as exploration and resource assessment, sampling typically is from natural outcrops, test pits, old or existing mines in the region, drill cuttings, or drilled cores. Characterization of a mine's reserves or production may use sample collection in the mine, representative cuts from coal conveyors or from handling and loading equipment, or directly from stockpiles or shipments (coal rail cars or barges). Contract specifications rely on sampling from the production flow at the mining or coal handling facility or at the loadout, or from the incoming shipments at the receiver's facility. In all cases, the value of a sample taken depends on its being representative of the coal under consideration, which in turn requires that appropriate sampling procedures be carefully followed. For coal resource and estimated reserve characterization, appropriate types of samples include:  <ul> <li> <b>Face channel or channel sample</b>: a sample taken at the exposed coal in a mine by cutting away any loose or weathered coal then collecting on a clean surface a sample of the coal seam by chopping out a channel of uniform width and depth; a face channel or face sample is taken at or near the working face, the most freshly exposed coal where actual removal and loading of mined coal is taking place. Any partings greater than 3/8 inch and/or mineral concretions greater than 1/2 inch thick and 2 inches in maximum diameter are normally discarded from a channel sample so as better to represent coal that has been mined, crushed, and screened to remove at least gross non-coal materials. </li>  <li>  <b>Column sample</b>: a channel or drill core sample taken to represent the entire geologic coalbed; it includes all partings and impurities that may exist in the coalbed. </li>    <li>  <b>Bench sample</b>: a face or channel sample taken of just that contiguous portion of a coalbed that is considered practical to mine, also known as a "bench;"  For example, bench samples may be taken of minable coal where impure coal that makes up part of the geologic coalbed is likely to be left in the mine, or where thick partings split the coal into two or more distinct minable seams,  or where extremely thick coalbeds cannot be recovered by normal mining equipment, so that the coal is mined in multiple passes, or benches, usually defined along natural bedding planes. </li>   <li>  <b>Composite sample</b>: a recombined coalbed sample produced by averaging together thickness-weighted coal analyses from partial samples of the coalbed, such as from one or more bench samples, from one or more mine exposures or outcrops where the entire bed could not be accessed in one sample, or from multiple drill cores that were required to retrieve all local sections of a coal seam.</li></ul></p>

The price for a particular sale may embody some or all of these components. The energy charge is made on a per-kilowatt basis and is intended to recover the seller's system incremental variable costs of making a sale. Because the nonfuel expenses are usually hard to quantify, and small relative to fuel expense, energy charges quoted are usually based on fuel cost. A capacity charge is set at a certain level per kilowatt and is normally paid whether or not energy is taken by the buyer. An adder is added to that energy charge to recover the hard quantify nonfuel variable costs. There are three types of adders	percentage, fixed, and split savings. A percentage adder increases the energy charge by a certain percentage. A fixed adder adds a fixed amount per kilowatt hour to the energy charge. Split savings adders are used only in economy energy transactions. They split production costs savings between the seller and the buyer by adding one half of the savings to the energy cost.</p>
