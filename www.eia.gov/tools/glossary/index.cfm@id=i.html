           <p><strong><a name="id_res"></a>Identified resources:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal deposits whose location, rank, quality, and quantity are known from geologic evidence supported by engineering measurements. Included are beds of bituminous coal and anthracite (14 or more inches thick) and beds of subbituminous coal and lignite (30 or more inches thick) that occur at depths to 6,000 feet. The existence and quantity of these beds have been delineated within specified degrees of geologic assurance as measured, indicated, or inferred. Also included are thinner and/or deeper beds that presently are being mined or for which there is evidence that they could be mined commercially.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="idle_cap"></a>Idle capacity:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The component of operable capacity that is not in operation and not under active repair, but capable of being placed in operation within 30 days; and capacity not in operation but under active repair that can be completed within 90 days.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="IEA"></a>IEA:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; International Energy Agency</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="imped"></a>Impedance:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition to power flow in an AC circuit. Also, any device that introduces such opposition in the form of resistance, reactance, or both. The impedance of a circuit or device is measured as the ratio of voltage to current, where a sinusoidal voltage and current of the same frequency are used for the measurement; it is measured in ohms.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="imp_price_defl"></a>Implicit price deflator:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The implicit price deflator, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, is used to convert nominal figures to real figures.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="impliedhr"></a>Implied heat rate:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A calculation of the day-ahead electric price divided by the day-ahead natural gas price. Implied heat rate is also known as the ‘break-even natural gas market heat rate,’ because only a natural gas generator with an operating heat rate (measure of unit efficiency) below the implied heat rate value can make money by burning natural gas to generate power. Natural gas plants with a higher operating heat rate cannot make money at the prevailing electricity and natural gas prices.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="imp_crude_burn"></a>Imported crude oil burned as fuel:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of foreign crude oil burned as a fuel oil, usually as residual fuel oil, without being processed as such. Imported crude oil burned as fuel includes lease condensate and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tarsands, gilsonite, and oil shale.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="imp_ref_acq_cost"></a>Imported Refiners' Acquisition Cost (IRAC):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The average price for imported oil paid by U.S. refiners.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="imports"></a>Imports:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipts of goods into the 50 States and the District of Columbia from U.S. possessions and territories or from foreign countries.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="impr_recov"></a>Improved recovery:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraction of crude oil or natural gas by any method other than those that rely primarily on natural reservoir pressure, gas lift, or a system of pumps.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="in_situ_leach"></a>In situ leach mining (ISL):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The recovery, by chemical leaching, of the valuable components of a mineral deposit without physical extraction of the mineralized rock from the ground. Also referred to as "solution mining."</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="inhouse_DSM_pr_sp"></a>In-house Demand-Side Management (DSM) program sponsor:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The building's owner or management encourages consumers in the building to improve energy efficiency, reduce energy costs, change timing or energy usage, or promote the use of a different energy source by sponsoring its own DSM programs.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="in_use_veh"></a>In-use (vehicles):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implies that a vehicle is: <ol> 		  <li> Registered with the Government of one or more States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands; or   <li>The vehicle is owned or operated by a Government or military organization within the United States that is not required to register vehicles with the Government agencies listed under 1 above. For example, civilian Federal vehicles are generally not required to register with the State Government in which they are assigned.</ol></p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="inadv_pwr_exch"></a>Inadvertent power exchange:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;An unintended power exchange among utilities that is either not previously agreed upon or in an amount different from the amount agreed upon.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="incand"></a>Incandescent lamp:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A glass enclosure in which light is produced when a tungsten filament is electrically heated so that it glows. Much of the energy is converted into heat; therefore, this class of lamp is a relatively inefficient source of light. Included in this category are the familiar screw-in light bulbs, as well as somewhat more efficient lamps, such as tungsten halogen lamps, reflector or r-lamps, parabolic aluminized reflector (PAR) lamps, and ellipsoidal reflector(ER) lamps.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="incand_bulbs"></a>Incandescent light bulbs, including regular or energy-efficient light bulbs:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;An incandescent bulb is a type of electric light in which light is produced by a filament heated by electric current. The most common example is the type you find in most table and floor lamps. In commercial buildings, incandescent lights are used for display lights in retail stores, hotels and motels. This includes the very small, high-intensity track lights used to display merchandise or provide spot illumination in restaurants. Energy efficient light bulbs, known as "watt-savers," use less energy than a standard incandescent bulb. "Long-life" bulbs, bulbs that last longer than standard incandescent but produce considerably less light, are not considered energy-efficient bulbs. This category also includes halogen lamps. Halogen lamps are a special type of incandescent lamp containing halogen gas to produce a brighter, whiter light than standard incandescent. Halogen lamps come in three styles		 bulbs, models with reflectors, and infrared models with reflectors. Halogen lamps are especially suited to recessed or "canned fixtures," track lights, and outdoor lights.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="incent_dsm_ass"></a>Incentives Demand-Side Management (DSM) program assistance:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This DSM program assistance offers monetary or non-monetary awards to encourage consumers to buy energy-efficient equipment and to participate in programs designed to reduce energy usage. Examples of incentives are zero or low-interest loans, rebates, and direct installation of low cost measures, such as water heater wraps or duct work for distributing the cool air; the units condition air only in the room or areas where they are located.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="incr_effect"></a>Incremental effects:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual changes in energy use (measured in megawatt hours) and peak load (measured in kilowatts) caused by new participants in existing DSM (Demand-Side Management) programs and all participants in new DSM programs during a given year. Reported Incremental Effects are annualized to indicate the program effects that would have occurred had these participants been initiated into the program on January 1 of the given year. Incremental effects are not simply the Annual Effects of a given year minus the Annual Effects of the prior year, since these net effects would fail to account for program attrition, equipment degradation, building demolition, and participant dropouts. Please note that Incremental Effects are not a monthly disaggregate of the Annual Effects, but are the total year's effects of only the new participants and programs for that year.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="incr_en_cost"></a>Incremental energy costs:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional cost of producing and/or transmitting electric energy above some previously determined base cost.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_pwr_prod"></a>Independent power producer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A corporation, person, agency, authority, or other legal entity or instrumentality that owns or operates facilities for the generation of electricity for use primarily by the public, and that is not an electric utility.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_syst_op"></a>Independent system operator (ISO):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;An independent, federally regulated entity established to coordinate regional transmission in a non-discriminatory manner and ensure the safety and reliability of the electric system. <a href = "http://www.ferc.gov/help/glossary.asp">FERC definition</a></p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_coal_lease"></a>Indian coal lease:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A lease granted to a mining company to produce coal from Indian lands in exchange for royalties and other revenues; obtained by direct negotiation with Indian tribal authorities, but subject to approval and administration by the U.S. Department of the Interior.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_res"></a>Indicated reserves:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=P#prob_res ">Probable energy reserves</a>.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_res_coal"></a>Indicated resources, coal:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal for which estimates of the rank, quality, and quantity are based partly on sample analyses and measurements and partly on reasonable geologic projections. Indicated resources are computed partly from specified measurements and partly from projection of visible data for a reasonable distance on the basis of geologic evidence. The points of observation are 1/2 to 1-1/2miles apart. Indicated coal is projected to extend as a 1/2-mile-widebelt that lies more than 1/4 mile from the outcrop, points of observation, or measurement.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_cost"></a>Indirect cost:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs not directly related to mining or milling operations, such as overhead, insurance, security, office expenses, property taxes, and similar administrative expenses.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_use"></a>Indirect uses (end-use category):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The end-use category that handles boiler fuel. Fuel in boilers is transformed into another useful energy source, steam or hot water, which is in turn used in other end uses, such as process or space heating or electricity generation. Manufacturers find measuring quantities of steam as it passes through to various end uses especially difficult because variations in both temperature and pressure affect energy content. Thus, the MECS (an EIA survey) does not present end-use estimates of steam or hot water and shows only the amount of the fuel used in the boiler to produce those secondary energy sources.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_util_cost"></a>Indirect utility cost:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A utility cost that may not be meaning fully identified with any particular DSM program category.  Indirect costs could be attributable to one of several accounting cost categories (i.e., Administrative, Marketing, Monitoring evaluation, Utility-Earned Incentives, Other).  Accounting costs that are known DSM program costs should not be reported under Indirect Utility Cost; those costs should be reported as Direct Utility Costs under the appropriate DSM program category.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_prod"></a>Industrial production:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board calculates this index by compiling indices of physical output from a variety of agencies and trade groups, weighting each index by the Census' value added, and adding it to the cost of materials. When physical measures are not available, the Federal Reserve Board uses the number of production workers or amount of electricity consumed as the basis for the index. To convert industrial production into dollars, multiply by the "real value added" estimate used by the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_restr_coal"></a>Industrial restrictions (coal):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Land-use restrictions that constrain, postpone, or prohibit mining in order to meet other industrial needs or goals; for example, resources not mined due to safety concerns or due to industrial or societal priorities, such as to preserve oil or gas wells that penetrate the coal reserves; to protect surface features such as pipelines, power lines, or company facilities; or to preserve public or private assets, such as highways, railroads, parks, or buildings.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="ind_sect"></a>Industrial sector:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;An energy-consuming sector that consists of all facilities and equipment used for producing, processing, or assembling goods.  The industrial sector encompasses the following types of activity manufacturing (NAICS codes 31-33); agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (NAICS code 11); mining, including oil and gas extraction (NAICS code 21); and construction (NAICS code 23). Overall energy use in this sector is largely for process heat and cooling and powering machinery, with lesser amounts used for facility heating, air conditioning, and lighting. Fossil fuels are also used as raw material inputs to manufactured products. Note: This sector includes generators that produce electricity and/or useful thermal output primarily to support the above-mentioned industrial activities. Various EIA programs differ in sectoral coverage.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="irb"></a>Inferred reserve base (coal):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;the resources in the inferred reliability category that meet the same criteria of bed thickness and depth from surface as the demonstrated reserve base.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="inf_res"></a>Inferred resources:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal in unexplored extensions of demonstrated resources for which estimates of the quality and size are based on geologic evidence and projection. Quantitative estimates are based largely on broad knowledge of the geologic character of the bed or region and where few measurements of bed thickness are available. The estimates are based primarily on an assumed continuation from demonstrated coal for which there is geologic evidence. The points of observation are 1-1/2 to 6 miles apart. Inferred coal is projected to extend as a 2-1/4-mile wide belt that lies more than 3/4 mile from the outcrop, points of observation, or measurement.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="in_enr"></a>Initial enrichment:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Average enrichment for a fresh fuel assembly as specified and ordered in fuel cycle planning. This average should include axial blankets and axially and radially zoned enrichments.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="in_op"></a>Initial operation:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;First availability of a newly constructed unit to provide power to the grid. For a nuclear unit, this time is when the Full Power Operating License for the unit is received.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="inop_capacity"></a>Inoperable capacity:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Generating capacity that is totally or partially out of service at the time of system peak load, either for scheduled outages (see GADS definition of "scheduled outages." These include both maintenance outages and planned outages.) or for reasons such as		 environmental restrictions; extensive modifications or repair; or capacity specified as being in a mothballed state.  This does not include derated portions of generating capacity.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="installed_nc"></a>Installed nameplate capacity:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="index.cfm@id=G.html#gen_nameplate">Generator nameplate capacity (installed)</a>.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="inst_peak_d"></a>Instantaneous peak demand:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum demand at the instant of greatest load.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="inst_water_htr"></a>Instantaneous water heater:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also called a "tankless" or "point-of-use" water heater. The water is heated at the point of use as it is needed.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="instit_liv_qu"></a>Institutional living quarters:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space provided by a business or organization for long-term housing of individuals whose reason for shared residence is their association with the business or organization. Such quarters commonly have both individual and group living spaces, and the business or organization is responsible for some aspects of resident life beyond the simple provision of living quarters. Examples include prisons; nursing homes and other long-term medical care facilities; military barracks; college dormitories; and convents and monasteries.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="insul"></a>Insulation:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any material or substance that provides a high resistance to the flow of heat from one surface to another. The different types include blanket or batt, foam, or loose fill, which are used to reduce heat transfer by conduction. Dead air space is an insulating medium in storm windows and storms as it reduces passage of heat through conduction and convection. Reflective materials are used to reduce heat transfer by radiation.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="insul_ducts"></a>Insulation around heating and/or cooling ducts:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra insulation around the heating and/or cooling ducts intended to reduce the loss of hot or cold air as it travels to different parts of the residence.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="insul_pipes"></a>Insulation around hot-water pipes:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapping of insulating material around hot-water pipes to reduce the loss of heat through the pipes.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="insul_wtr_heater"></a>Insulation around water heater:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanket insulation wrapped around the water heater to reduce loss of heat. To qualify under this definition, this wrapping must be in addition to any insulation provided by the manufacturer.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="insulator"></a>Insulator:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A material that is a very poor conductor of electricity. The insulating material is usually a ceramic or fiberglass when used in the transmission line and is designed to support a conductor physically and to separate it electrically from other conductors and supporting material.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="intang_dd_cost"></a>Intangible drilling and development costs (IDC):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs incurred in preparing well locations, drilling and deepening wells, and preparing wells for initial production up through the point of installing control valves. None of these functions, because of their nature, have salvage value.
