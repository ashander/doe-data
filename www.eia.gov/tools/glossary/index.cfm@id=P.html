These are self-contained units that contain the equipment that generates cool air and the equipment that distributes the cooled air. These units commonly consume natural gas or electricity. The units are mounted on the roof top, exposed to the elements. They typically blow cool air into the building through duct work, but other types of distribution systems may exist. The units usually serve more than one room. There are often several units on the roof of a single building. Also known as		 Packaged Terminal Air Conditioners (PTAC). These packaged units are often constructed as a single unit for heating and for cooling.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="pack_units"></a>Packaged units:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Units built and assembled at a factory and installed as a self-contained unit to heat or cool all or portions of a building.

Packaged Units can apply to heating equipment, cooling equipment, or combined heating and cooling equipment. Some types of electric packaged units are also called "Direct Expansion" or DX units.</p>
