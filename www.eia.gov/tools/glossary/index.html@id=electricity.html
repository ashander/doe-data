           <p><strong><a name="derate"></a>Derate:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A decrease in the available capacity of an electric generating unit, commonly due to: <br><br>

&#8226 A system or equipment modification <br>
&#8226 Environmental, operational, or reliability considerations.  Causes of generator capacity deratings include high cooling water temperatures, equipment degradation, and historical performance during peak demand periods.

Spark spread is a measure of potential profit for generating electricity on a particular day.<BR>
<BR>
A key component in the spark spread equation is the heat rate (measure of efficiency) of the generating unit. A common measure for heat rate used in the trade press is 7,000 Btu/kWh. This heat rate is broadly representative of the efficiency of newer natural gas combined-cycle power plants. (By way of comparison, a plant that has a 50% efficiency rate has a heat rate of 6,824 Btu/kWh.) The most efficient natural gas combined-cycle power plants have heat rates somewhat below the 7,000 Btu/kWh threshold; they can make money even when the implied (breakeven) heat rate is a little below 7,000 Btu/kWh. Conversely, as the level of plant efficiency decreases, the spark spread diminishes—thus, older, less efficient plants have lower spark spreads than those with a heat rate of 7,000 Btu/kWh.  </p>
