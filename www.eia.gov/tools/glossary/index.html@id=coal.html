           <p><strong><a name="CIF_cargo"></a>CIF (cargo, insurance and freight):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;CIF refers to cargos for which the seller pays for the transportation and insurance up to the port of destination.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="CIF_cost"></a>CIF (cost, insurance, freight):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This term refers to a type of sale in which the buyer of the product agrees to pay a unit price that includes the f.o.b. value of the product at the point of origin plus all costs of insurance and transportation. This type of a transaction differs from a "delivered" purchase, in that the buyer accepts the quantity as determined at the loading port (as certified by the Bill of Lading and Quality Report) rather than pay based on the quantity and quality ascertained at the unloading port. It is similar to the terms of an f.o.b. sale, except that the seller, as a service for which he is compensated, arranges for transportation and insurance.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal"></a>Coal:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A readily combustible black or brownish-black rock whose composition, including inherent moisture, consists of more than 50 percent by weight and more than 70 percent by volume of carbonaceous material. It is formed from plant remains that have been compacted, hardened, chemically altered, and metamorphosed by heat and pressure over geologic time.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_anal"></a>Coal analysis:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Determines the composition and properties of coal so it can be ranked and used most effectively.  <ul> <li> <b>Proximate analysis,</b> determines, on an as-received basis, the      moisture content, volatile matter (gases released when coal is heated), fixed carbon (solid fuel left after the volatile matter is driven off), and ash (impurities consisting of silica, iron,      alumina, and other incombustible matter). The moisture content affects the ease with which coal can be handled and burned. The amount of volatile matter and fixed carbon provides guidelines for determining the intensity of the heat produced. Ash increases the  weight of coal, adds to the cost of handling, and can cause problems such as clinkering and slagging in boilers and furnaces.    </li> <li> <b>Ultimate analysis</b> determines the amount of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Heating value is determined in terms      of Btu, both on an as received basis (including moisture) and on a  dry basis.    </li> <li> <b>Agglomerating</b> refers to coal that softens when heated and forms a  hard gray coke; this coal is called caking coal. Not all caking coals are coking coals. The agglomerating value is used to differentiate between coal ranks and also is a guide to determine how a particular coal reacts in a furnace.    </li> <li> <b>Agglutinating</b> refers to the binding qualities of a coal. The agglutinating value is an indication of how well a coke made from  a particular coal will perform in a blast furnace. It is also called a caking index.    </li> <li> <b>Other tests</b> include the determination of the ash softening temperature, the ash fusion temperature (the temperature at which the ash forms clinkers or slag), the free swelling index (a guide to a coal's coking characteristics), the Gray King test (which determines the suitability of coal for making coke), and the Hardgrove grindability index (a measure of the ease with which coal can be pulverized). In a petrographic analysis, thin sections of coal or highly polished blocks of coal are studied with a microscope to determine the physical composition, both for scientific purposes and for estimating the rank and coking potential.</li> </ul></p>

           <p><strong><a name="coal_blending"></a>Coal Blending:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of combining two or more coals with different characteristics to obtain coal with a certain quality, such as low sulfur content. </p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_briquet"></a>Coal briquets:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthracite, bituminous, and lignite briquets comprise the secondary solid fuels manufactured from coal by a process in which the coal is partly dried, warmed to expel excess moisture, and then compressed into briquets, usually without the use of a binding substance. In the reduction of briquets to coal equivalent, different conversion factors are applied according to their origin from hard coal, peat, brown coal, or lignite.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_carbon"></a>Coal carbonized:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of coal decomposed into solid coke and gaseous products by heating in a coke oven in a limited air supply or in the absence of air.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_chem"></a>Coal chemicals:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal chemicals are obtained from the gases and vapor recovered from the manufacturing of coke. Generally, crude tar, ammonia, crude light oil, and gas are the basic products recovered. They are refined or processed to yield a variety of chemical materials.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_classification"></a>Coal Classification:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, coals are classified by rank progressively from lignite (least carbonaceous) to anthracite (most carbonaceous) based on the proximate analyses of various properties (fixed carbon, volatile matter, heating value, and agglomerating character), following methods prescribed by the <a href = "http://www.astm.org/">American Society for Testing and Materials</a>. The International Coal Classification of the Economic Commission for Europe recognizes two broad categories of coal, “brown coal” and “hard coal.” In terms of U.S. coal classification, the international classification of brown coal includes lignite and lower-ranked subbituminous coal, whereas hard coal includes all higher rank coals.

           <p><strong><a name="coal_prep"></a>Coal preparation:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of sizing and cleaning coal to meet market specifications by removing impurities such as rock, sulfur, etc. It may include crushing, screening, or mechanical cleaning.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_preparation"></a>Coal Preparation Processes (Cleaning/Beneficiation/Processing):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In its broadest sense, preparation is any processing of mined coal to prepare it for market, including crushing and screening or sieving the coal to reach a uniform size, which normally results in removal of some non-coal or waste material. The term coal preparation most commonly refers to processing, including crushing and screening, passing the material through one or more processes to remove impurities, sizing the product, and loading for shipment. Many of the processes separate rock, clay, and other minerals from coal in a liquid medium; hence, the term washing is widely used.  In some cases, coal passes through a drying step before loading.

           <p><strong><a name="coal_prod_dist"></a>Coal producing districts:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A classification of coal fields defined in the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937. The districts were originally established to aid in formulating minimum prices of bituminous and subbituminous coal and lignite. Because much statistical information was compiled in terms of these districts, their use for statistical purposes has continued since the abandonment of that legislation in 1943. District 24 was added for the anthracite-producing district in Pennsylvania.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_prod"></a>Coal production:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of sales, mine consumption, issues to miners, and issues to coke, briquetting, and other ancillary plants at mines.

           <p><strong><a name="coal_samp"></a>Coal sampling:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection and proper storage and handling of a relatively small quantity of coal for laboratory analysis. Sampling may be done for a wide range of purposes, such as: coal resource exploration and assessment, characterization of their serves or production of a mine, to characterize the results of coal cleaning processes, to monitor coal shipments or receipts for adherence to coal quality contract specifications, or to subject a coal to specific combustion or reactivity tests related to the customer's intended use. During pre-development phases, such as exploration and resource assessment, sampling typically is from natural outcrops, test pits, old or existing mines in the region, drill cuttings, or drilled cores. Characterization of a mine's reserves or production may use sample collection in the mine, representative cuts from coal conveyors or from handling and loading equipment, or directly from stockpiles or shipments (coal rail cars or barges). Contract specifications rely on sampling from the production flow at the mining or coal handling facility or at the loadout, or from the incoming shipments at the receiver's facility. In all cases, the value of a sample taken depends on its being representative of the coal under consideration, which in turn requires that appropriate sampling procedures be carefully followed. For coal resource and estimated reserve characterization, appropriate types of samples include:  <ul> <li> <b>Face channel or channel sample</b>: a sample taken at the exposed coal in a mine by cutting away any loose or weathered coal then collecting on a clean surface a sample of the coal seam by chopping out a channel of uniform width and depth; a face channel or face sample is taken at or near the working face, the most freshly exposed coal where actual removal and loading of mined coal is taking place. Any partings greater than 3/8 inch and/or mineral concretions greater than 1/2 inch thick and 2 inches in maximum diameter are normally discarded from a channel sample so as better to represent coal that has been mined, crushed, and screened to remove at least gross non-coal materials. </li>  <li>  <b>Column sample</b>: a channel or drill core sample taken to represent the entire geologic coalbed; it includes all partings and impurities that may exist in the coalbed. </li>    <li>  <b>Bench sample</b>: a face or channel sample taken of just that contiguous portion of a coalbed that is considered practical to mine, also known as a "bench;"  For example, bench samples may be taken of minable coal where impure coal that makes up part of the geologic coalbed is likely to be left in the mine, or where thick partings split the coal into two or more distinct minable seams,  or where extremely thick coalbeds cannot be recovered by normal mining equipment, so that the coal is mined in multiple passes, or benches, usually defined along natural bedding planes. </li>   <li>  <b>Composite sample</b>: a recombined coalbed sample produced by averaging together thickness-weighted coal analyses from partial samples of the coalbed, such as from one or more bench samples, from one or more mine exposures or outcrops where the entire bed could not be accessed in one sample, or from multiple drill cores that were required to retrieve all local sections of a coal seam.</li></ul></p>

           <p><strong><a name="coal_sulfur"></a>Coal sulfur:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal sulfur occurs in three forms: organic, sulfate, and pyritic. Organic sulfur is an integral part of the coal matrix and cannot be removed by conventional physical separation. Sulfate sulfur is usually negligible. Pyritic sulfur occurs as the minerals pyrite and marcasite; larger sizes generally can be removed by cleaning the coal.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_synfuel"></a>Coal synfuel:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal-based solid fuel that has been processed by a coal synfuel plant; and coal-based fuels such as briquettes, pellets, or extrusions, which are formed from fresh or recycled coal and binding materials.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_type"></a>Coal type:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The classification is based on physical characteristics or microscopic constituents.

See <a href="index.cfm@id=C.html#coal_grade">Coal grade</a>.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coal_washing"></a>Coal Washing:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of coal to remove waste material such as:
<i>Dense (heavy) medium processes</i> use a thick solution, usually a mixture of magnetite and water, to separate coal from impurities, such as sulfur, ash, and mercury, by gravity separation. <i>Flotation processes</i> treat fine-sized coal with an oil-based reagent that attracts air bubbles in a liquid medium; the coal floats to the surface as froth, leaving the refuse below. <i>Hydraulic processes</i> use currents of water to separate coal from impurities. <i>Pneumatic processes</i> use currents of air to separate coal from impurities.

A high-powered cutting machine is passed across the exposed face of coal, shearing away broken coal, which is continuously hauled away by a floor-level conveyor system. Longwall mining extracts all machine-minable coal between the floor and ceiling within a contiguous block of coal, known as a panel, leaving no support pillars within the panel area. Panel dimensions vary over time and with mining conditions but currently average about 900 feet wide (coal face width) and more than 8,000 feet long (the minable extent of the panel, measured indirection of mining). Longwall mining is done under movable roof supports that are advanced as the bed is cut. The roof in the mined-out area is allowed to fall as the mining advances.</p>

A stripping ratio may be expressed as (1) thickness of overburden to thickness of coal, (2) volume of overburden to volume coal, (3) weight of overburden to weight of coal, or (4) cubic yards of overburden to tons of coal. A stripping ratio commonly is used to express the maximum thickness, volume, or weight of overburden that can be profitably removed to obtain a unit amount of coal.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="sub_coal"></a>Subbituminous coal:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A coal whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal and used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation. It may be dull, dark brown to black, soft and crumbly, at the lower end of the range, to bright, jet black, hard, and relatively strong, at the upper end. Subbituminous coal contains 20 to 30 percent inherent moisture by weight. The heat content of subbituminous coal ranges from 17 to 24 million Btu per ton on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis.

           <p><strong><a name="sulffur"></a>Sulfur:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A yellowish nonmetallic element, sometimes known as "brimstone." It is present at various levels of concentration in many fossil fuels whose combustion releases sulfur compounds that are considered harmful to the environment. Some of the most commonly used fossil fuels are categorized according to their sulfur content, with lower sulfur fuels usually selling at a higher price. Note: No.2 Distillate fuel is currently reported as having either a 0.05 percent or lower sulfur level for on-highway vehicle use or a greater than 0.05 percent sulfur level for off-highway use, home heating oil, and commercial and industrial uses. Residual fuel, regardless of use, is classified as having either no more than 1 percent sulfur or greater than 1 percent sulfur. Coal is also classified as being low- sulfur at concentrations of 1 percent or less or high-sulfur at concentrations greater than 1 percent.</p>

           <p><strong><a name="und_mine"></a>Underground mine:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A mine where coal is produced by tunneling into the earth to the coalbed, which is then mined with underground mining equipment such as cutting machines and continuous, longwall, and shortwall mining machines. Underground mines are classified according to the type of opening used to reach the coal, i.e., drift (level tunnel), slope (inclined tunnel), or shaft (vertical tunnel).</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="und_min_equip"></a>Underground mining equipment:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul> <li>A <b>coal-cutting machine</b> is used in conventional mining to undercut, top cut, or shear the coal face so that coal can be fractured easily when blasted. It cuts 9 to 13 feet into the bed.<li> <b>Continuous auger machine</b> is used in mining coalbeds less than 3 feet thick. The auger has a cutting depth of about 5 feet and is 20 to 28 inches in diameter. Continuous auger mining usually uses a conveyor belt to haul the coal to the surface. <li><b>Continuous mining machine</b>, used during continuous mining, cuts or rips coal from the face and loads it into shuttle cars or conveyors in one operation. It eliminates the use of blasting devices and performs many functions of other equipment such as drills, cutting machines, and loaders. A continuous mining machine typically has a turning "drum" with sharp bits that cut and dig out the coal for 16 to 22 feet before mining stops so that the mined area can be supported with roof bolts. This machine can mine coal at the rate of 8 to 15 tons per minute. <li>There are of two types of <b>conveyor systems</b>: <ol> <li> A <b>mainline conveyor</b>, which is usually a permanent installation that carries coal to the surface. <li> A <b>section conveyor</b>, which connects the working face to the mainline conveyor.</li> </ol> <li><b>Face drill</b> is used in conventional mining to drill shot holes in the coalbed for explosive charges.<li><b> Loading machine</b> is used in conventional mining to scoop broken coal from the working area and load it into a shuttle car, which hauls the coal to mine cars or conveyors for delivery to the surface. <li><b>Longwall mining machine</b> shears coal from a long straight coal face (up to about 700 feet) by working back and forth across the face under a movable, hydraulic-jack roof-support system. The broken coal is transported by conveyor. Longwall machines can mine coal at the rate of 1,000 tons per shift. Mine locomotive, operating on tracks, is used to haul mine cars containing coal and other material, and to move personnel in specially designed "mantrip" cars. Large locomotives can haul more than 20 tons at a speed of about 10 miles per hour. Most mine locomotives run on electricity provided by a trolley wire; some are battery-powered.<li><b> Ram car or shuttle ram</b> is a rubber-tired haulage vehicle that is unloaded through the use of a movable steel plate located at the back of the haulage bed. <li><b>Roof-bolting machine, or roof bolter</b>, is used to drill holes and place bolts to support the mine roof. Roof bolting units can be installed on a continuous mining machine. <li><b>Scoop</b> is a rubber-tired haulage vehicle used in thin coalbeds. <li><b>Shortwall mining machine</b> generally is a continuous-mining machine used with a powered, self-advancing roof support system. It shears coal from a short coal face (up to about 150 feet long). The broken coal is hauled by shuttle cars to a conveyor belt. <li><b>Shuttle car</b> is a rubber-tired haulage vehicle that is unloaded by a built-in conveyor.</li> </ul></p>
