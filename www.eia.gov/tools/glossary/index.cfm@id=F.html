           <p><strong><a name="flare"></a>Flare:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall stack equipped with burners used as a safety device at wellheads, refining facilities, gas processing plants, and chemical plants.  Flares are used for the combustion and disposal of combustible gases.  The gases are piped to a remote, usually elevated, location and burned in an open flame in the open air using a specially designed burner tip, auxiliary fuel, and steam or air. Combustible gases are flared most often due to emergency relief, overpressure, process upsets, startups, shutdowns, and other operational safety reasons.  Natural gas that is uneconomical for sale is also flared.  Often natural gas is flared as a result of the unavailability of a method for transporting such gas to markets. </p>

Gains and losses on those foreign currency transactions are generally included in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change unless the transaction hedges a foreign currency commitment or a net investment in a foreign entity. Intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are considered part of a parent's net investment and hence do not give rise to gains or losses.</p>

This process is generally required to consolidate the financial statements of foreign affiliates into the total company financial statements and to recognize the conversion of foreign currency or the settlement of a receivable or payable denominated in foreign currency at a rate different from that at which the item is recorded. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are disclosed as separate components of consolidated equity.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="for_ops"></a>Foreign operations:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These are operations that are located outside the United States.

           <p><strong><a name="forw_cost_B"></a>Forward cost (2):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating and capital costs still to be incurred in the production of uranium from in-place reserves. By using forward costing, estimates for reserves for ore deposits in differing geological settings and status of development can be aggregated and reported for selected cost categories.

Excluded from forward cost estimates are prior expenditures, if any, incurred for property acquisition, exploration, mine development, and mill construction, as well as income taxes, profit, and the cost of money. Forward costs are neither the full costs of production nor the market price at which the uranium, when produced, might be sold.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="forward_costs_ur"></a>Forward costs (uranium):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating and capital costs that will be incurred in any future production of uranium from in-place reserves.

Excluded from forward costs are prior expenditures, if any, incurred for property acquisition, exploration, mine development, and mill construction, as well as income taxes, profit, and the cost of money. Note: By use of forward costing, estimates of reserves for ore deposits in differing geological settings can be aggregated and reported as the maximum amount that can theoretically be extracted to recover the specified costs of uranium oxide production under the listed forward cost categories.</p>

If the company has a credit card for use at a fuel provider's locations, but is not bound by an additional agreement to purchase fuel from that provider, the credit card agreement alone is not considered a fuel purchase agreement.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fuel_ratio"></a>Fuel ratio:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matter in coal.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fuel_switch_cap"></a>Fuel switching capability:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term capability of a manufacturing establishment to have used substitute energy sources in place of those actually consumed. Capability to use substitute energy sources means that the establishment's combustors (for example, boilers, furnaces, ovens, and blast furnaces) had the machinery or equipment either in place or available for installation so that substitutions could actually have been introduced within 30 days without extensive modifications. Fuel-switching capability does not depend on the relative prices of energy sources; it depends only on the characteristics of the equipment and certain legal constraints.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fuel_wood"></a>Fuel wood:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood and wood products, possibly including scrubs and branches, etc, bought or gathered, and used by direct combustion.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fuel_switch_DSM"></a>Fuel-switching DSM program assistance:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;DSM program assistance where the sponsor encourages consumers to change from one fuel to another for a particular end-use service. For example, utilities might encourage consumers to replace electric water heaters with gas units or encourage industrial consumers to use electric microwave heaters instead of natural gas-heaters.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fuel_fab_identifier"></a>Fuel/fabricator assembly identifier:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual assembly identifier based on a numbering scheme developed by individual fuel fabricators. Most fuel fabricator assembly identifiers schemes closely match the scheme developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and are therefore unique.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fuels_solv"></a>Fuels solvent deasphalting:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A refining process for removing asphalt compounds from petroleum fractions, such as reduced crude oil. The recovered stream from this process is used to produce fuel products.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fug_emiss"></a>Fugitive emissions:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unintended leaks of gas from the processing, transmission, and/or transportation of fossil fuels.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="full_force"></a>Full forced outage:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The net capability of main generating units that are unavailable for load for emergency reasons.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="full_pow_day"></a>Full power day:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The equivalent of 24 hours of full power operation by a reactor. The number of full power days in a specific cycle is the product of the reactor's capacity factor and the length of the cycle.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="full_pow_op"></a>Full power operation:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation of a unit at 100 percent of its design capacity. Full-power operation precedes commercial operation.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="full_requ_cons"></a>Full requirements consumer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholesale consumer without other generating resources whose electric energy seller is the sole source of long-term firm power for the consumer's service area. The terms and conditions of sale are equivalent to the seller's obligations to its own retail service, if any.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fuma"></a>Fumarole:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A vent from which gas or steam issue; a geyser or spring that emits gases.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="furnace"></a>Furnace:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of a boiler or warm-air space-heating plant in which combustion takes place.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="furnace_coke_plant"></a>Furnace coke plant:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A coke plant whose coke production is used primarily by the producing company.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="furnaces_direct_heat"></a>Furnaces that heat directly, withoutusing steam or hot water (similar to a residential furnace):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Furnaces burn natural gas, fuel oil, propane/ butane (bottled gas), or electricity to warm the air. The warmed air is then distributed throughout the building through ducts. Many people use the words "boilers" and "furnaces" interchangeably. They are not the same. We mean that warm air is produced directly by burning some fuel. Warm-air furnaces typically rely on air ducts to carry the warm air throughout the building. Warm-air furnaces are often built in combination with central air-conditioning systems, so that they can use the same air ducts for either heating or air-conditioning (depending on the season). Other terms for describing this type of equipment include "central system," "split system," and "forced air/forces air furnace."</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="fut_mark"></a>Futures market:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A trade center for quoting prices on contracts for the delivery of a specified quantity of a commodity at a specified time and place in the future.</p>
