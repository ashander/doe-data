           <p><strong><a name="bal_item"></a>Balancing item:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Represents differences between the sum of the components of natural gas supply and the sum of the components of natural gas disposition. These differences may be due to quantities lost or to the effects of data reporting problems. Reporting problems include differences due to the net result of conversions off low data metered at varying temperature and pressure bases and converted to a standard temperature and pressure base; the effect of variations in company accounting and billing practices; differences between billing cycle and calendar period time frames; and imbalances resulting from the merger of data reporting systems that vary in scope, format, definitions, and type of respondents.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="base_gas"></a>Base gas:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity of natural gas needed to maintain adequate reservoir pressures and deliverability rates throughout the withdrawal season. Base gas usually is not withdrawn and remains in the reservoir. All natural gas native to a depleted reservoir is included in the base gas volume.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="biomass"></a>Biomass:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic nonfossil material of biological origin constituting a renewable energy source.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="brit_th_unit"></a>British thermal unit:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of liquid water by 1 degree Fahrenheit at the temperature at which water has its greatest density (approximately 39 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="citygate"></a>Citygate:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A point or measuring station at which a distributing gas utility receives gas from a natural gas pipeline company or transmission system.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="coke_gas"></a>Coke oven gas:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The mixture of permanent gases produced by the carbonization of coal in a coke oven at temperatures in excess of 1,000 degrees Celsius.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="compr_nat_gas"></a>Compressed natural gas (CNG):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.cfm@id=N.html#nat_gas">Natural gas</a> compressed to a pressure at or above 200-248 bar (i.e., 2900-3600 pounds per square inch) and stored in high-pressure containers.

           <p><strong><a name="dep_stor_field"></a>Depleted storage field:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A sub-surface natural geological reservoir, usually a depleted gas or oil field, used for storing natural gas.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="dry_nat_gas"></a>Dry natural gas:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural gas which remains after: 1) the liquefiable hydrocarbon portion has been removed from the gas stream (i.e., gas after lease, field, and/or plant separation); and 2) any volumes of nonhydrocarbon gases have been removed where they occur in sufficient quantity to render the gas unmarketable. Note: Dry natural gas is also known as consumer-grade natural gas. The parameters for measurement are cubic feet at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute. Also see <a href="index.cfm.html#nat_gas">Natural gas.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="dry_nat_gas_prod"></a>Dry natural gas production:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of producing consumer-grade natural gas. Natural gas withdrawn from reservoirs is reduced by volumes used at the production (lease) site and by processing losses. Volumes used at the production site include (1) the volume returned to reservoirs in cycling, repressuring of oil reservoirs, and conservation operations; and (2) gas vented and flared. Processing losses include (1) nonhydrocarbon gases (e.g., water vapor, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen sulfide, and nitrogen) removed from the gas stream; and (2) gas converted to liquid form, such as lease condensate and plant liquids. Volumes of dry gas withdrawn from gas storage reservoirs are not considered part of production. Dry natural gas production equals marketed production less extraction loss.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="el_power_sector"></a>Electric power sector:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;An energy-consuming sector that consists of electricity only and combined heat and power(CHP) plants whose primary business is to sell electricity, or electricity and heat, to the public--i.e., North American Industry Classification System 22 plants.

           <p><strong><a name="flare"></a>Flare:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall stack equipped with burners used as a safety device at wellheads, refining facilities, gas processing plants, and chemical plants.  Flares are used for the combustion and disposal of combustible gases.  The gases are piped to a remote, usually elevated, location and burned in an open flame in the open air using a specially designed burner tip, auxiliary fuel, and steam or air. Combustible gases are flared most often due to emergency relief, overpressure, process upsets, startups, shutdowns, and other operational safety reasons.  Natural gas that is uneconomical for sale is also flared.  Often natural gas is flared as a result of the unavailability of a method for transporting such gas to markets. </p>
