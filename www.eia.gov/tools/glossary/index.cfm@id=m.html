           <p><strong><a name="mach_drive"></a>Machine drive (motors):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct process end use in which thermal or electric energy is converted into mechanical energy. Motors are found in almost every process in manufacturing. Therefore, when motors are found in equipment that is wholly contained in another end use (such as process cooling and refrigeration), the energy is classified there rather than in machine drive.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="made_avail"></a>Made available (vehicle):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A vehicle is considered "Made available" if it is available for delivery to dealers or users, whether or not it was actually delivered to them. To be "Made available", the vehicle must be completed and available for delivery; thus, any conversion to be performed by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Vehicle Converter or Aftermarket Vehicle Converter must have been completed.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="magma"></a>Magma:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally occurring molten rock, generated within the earth and capable of intrusion and extrusion, from which igneous rocks are thought to have been derived through solidification and related processes.

           <p><strong><a name="main_struct"></a>Maintenance of structures (expenses):</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of labor, materials, and expenses incurred in maintenance of power production structures. Structures include all buildings and facilities to house, support, or safeguard property or persons.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="main_sup_exp"></a>Maintenance supervision and engineering expenses:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of labor and expenses incurred in the general supervision and direction of the maintenance of power generation stations.

The points of observation and measurement are so closely spaced and the thickness and extent of coals are so well defined that the tonnage is judged to be accurate within 20 percent. Although the spacing of the points of observation necessary to demonstrate continuity of the coal differs from region to region, according to the character of the coalbeds, the point of observation are no greater than 1/2 mile apart. Measured coal is projected to extend as a belt 1/4 mile wide from the outcrop or points of observation or measurement.</p>
