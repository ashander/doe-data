           <p><strong><a name="sgsp"></a>Salt gradient solar ponds:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These consist of three main layers. The top layer is near ambient and has low salt content. The bottom layer is hot, typically 160° F to 212° F (71° C to 100° C), and is very salty. The important gradient zone separates these zones. The gradient zone acts as a transparent insulator, permitting the sunlight to be trapped in the hot bottom layer (from which useful heat is withdrawn). This is because the salt gradient, which increases the brine density with depth, counteracts the buoyancy effect of the warmer water below (which would otherwise rise to the surface and lose its heat to the air). An organic Rankine cycle engine is used to convert the thermal energy to electricity.</p>

           <p><strong><a name="sparkspread"></a>Spark spread:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A measurement of the difference between the price that a generator can obtain from selling one megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity and the cost of the natural gas needed to generate the MWh of electricity. Spark spread is a measure of potential profit for generating electricity on a particular day.<BR>
<BR>
A key component in the spark spread equation is the heat rate (measure of efficiency) of the generating unit. A common measure for heat rate used in the trade press is 7,000 Btu/kWh. This heat rate is broadly representative of the efficiency of newer natural gas combined-cycle power plants. (By way of comparison, a plant that has a 50% efficiency rate has a heat rate of 6,824 Btu/kWh.) The most efficient natural gas combined-cycle power plants have heat rates somewhat below the 7,000 Btu/kWh threshold; they can make money even when the implied (breakeven) heat rate is a little below 7,000 Btu/kWh. Conversely, as the level of plant efficiency decreases, the spark spread diminishes—thus, older, less efficient plants have lower spark spreads than those with a heat rate of 7,000 Btu/kWh.  </p>

           <p><strong><a name="surface_mine"></a>Surface mine:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A coal-producing mine that is usually within a few hundred feet of the surface. Earth above or around the coal (overburden) is removed to expose the coalbed, which is then mined with surface excavation equipment, such as draglines, powers hovels, bulldozers, loaders, and augers. It may also be known as an area, contour, open-pit, strip, or auger mine.</p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="surf_min_equip"></a>Surface mining equipment:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul> <li>An Auger machine is a large, horizontal drill, generally 3 feet or more in diameter and up to about 100 feet long. It can remove coal at a rate of more than 25 tons per minute.  <li> A bucket-wheel excavator is a continuous digging machine equipped with a broom on which is mounted a rotating wheel with buckets along its edge. The buckets scoop up material, then empty onto a conveyor leading to a spoil bank. It is best suited for removing overburden that does not require blasting. This excavator is not widely used in the United States. <li>  A bulldozer is a tractor with a movable steel blade mounted on the front. It can be used to remove overburden that needs little or no blasting. <li> A carryall scraper (or pan scraper) is a self-loading machine, usually self-propelled, with a scraper-like retractable bottom. It is used to excavate and haul overburden. <li>  A continuous surface miner, used in some lignite mines, is  equipped with crawlers, a rotating cutting head, and a conveyor.  It travels over the bed, excavating a swath up to 13 feet wide and 2 feet deep.  <li>  A dragline excavator removes overburden to expose the coal by means of a scoop bucket that is suspended from a long boom. The dragline digs by pulling the bucket toward the machine by means of a wire rope.  <li>  A walking dragline is equipped with large outrigger platforms, or walking beams, instead of crawler tracks. It "walks" by the alternate movement of the walking beams.   <li>  A drilling rig is used to determine the amount and type of overburden overlying a coal deposit and the extent of the deposit, to delineate major geologic features, and to drill holes for explosives to fragment the overburden for easier removal.  <li>  A front-end loader is a tractor with a digging bucket mounted and  operated on the front. It is often used to remove overburden in  contour mining and to load coal.  <li>  An hydraulic shovel excavates and loads by means of a bucket attached to a rigid arm that is hinged to a broom. <li>  A power shovel removes overburden and loads coal by means of a digging bucket mounted at the end of an arm suspended from a    broom. The shovel digs by pushing the bucket forward and upward. It does not dig below the level at which it stands. <li> A thin-seam miner resembles an auger machine but has a drum-type cutting head that cuts a rectangular cross section.</li> </ul></p>
         
           <p><strong><a name="surf_min_meth"></a>Surface mining methods:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul> <li> Auger mining recovers coal through the use of a large-diameter drill driven into a coalbed in the side of a surface mine pit. It usually follows contour surface mining, particularly when the overburden is too costly to excavate.  <li> Area mining is practiced on relatively flat or gently rolling terrain and recovers coal by mining long strips successively; the material excavated from the strip being mined is deposited in the strip pit previously mined.  <li> Contour mining is practiced when the coal is mined on hillsides. The mining follows the contour of the hillside until the overburden becomes uneconomical to remove. This method creates a shelf, or bench, on the hillside. Several variations of contour mining have been developed to control environmental problems. These methods include slope reduction (overburden is spread so that the angle of the slope on the hillside is reduced), head-of-hollow fill (overburden is placed in narrow V-shaped valleys to control erosion), and block-cut (overburden from current mining is backfilled into a previously mined cut). <li> Explosives casting is a technique designed to blast up to 65 percent of the overburden into the mine pit for easier removal. It  differs from conventional overburden blasting, which only fractures the overburden before it is removed by excavating equipment.  <li> Mountaintop mining, sometimes considered a variation of contour mining, refers to the mining of a coalbed that underlies the top of a mountain. The overburden, which is the mountaintop, is completely removed so that all of the coal can be recovered. The overburden material is later replaced in the mined-out area. This method leaves large plateaus of level land. <li>Open-pit coal mining is essentially a combination of contour and area mining methods and is used to mine thick, steeply inclined coalbeds. The overburden is removed by power shovels and trucks. </li> </ul></p>
