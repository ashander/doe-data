        <h1>Chapter 2. Petroleum and other liquid fuels</h1>
        <div align="right"><a class="ico_pdf" href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/liquid_fuels.pdf"> print version</a></div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In the <em>International  Energy Outlook 2016</em> (IEO2016) Reference case, worldwide consumption of  petroleum and other liquid fuels increases from 90 million barrels per day  (b/d) in 2012 to 100 million b/d in 2020 and 121 million b/d in 2040. Much of  the growth in world liquid fuels consumption is projected for the emerging,  non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) economies  of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, where strong economic growth and rising  populations increase the demand for those fuels. In contrast, demand for liquid  fuels in the United States, OECD Europe, and other regions with  well-established liquids markets grows slowly or declines from 2012 to 2040.  After a long period of sustained high oil prices, conservation and efficiency  improvement measures have reduced or slowed the growth of liquid fuels use  among OECD consumers and, in the future, will help to temper demand growth in  non-OECD countries as well.</p>
<p>To satisfy rising demand for liquid fuels in the IEO2016 Reference  case, liquids production increases by 31 million b/d over the 2012&#8211;40 period.  IEO2016 projections of future liquid fuels balances include two broad  categories: c<em>rude oil and lease  condensate</em>, and<em> other liquid fuels</em>. <em>Crude oil and lease condensate</em> includes: reservoired oil (often referred to in the trade press as <em>conventional oil</em>), tight oil (shale  oil), extra-heavy crude oil, field condensate, and bitumen (i.e., oil sands,  either diluted or upgraded). <em>Other liquid  fuels</em> refers to natural gas plant liquids (NGPL), biofuels, including  biomass-to-liquids (BTL), gas-to-liquids (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL), kerogen  (i.e., oil shale), and refinery gain [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#20">20</a>].</p>
<p>The benchmark oil price in IEO2016 is based on spot prices  for North Sea Brent crude oil, which is an international standard for light  sweet crude oil. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot price is generally  lower than the North Sea Brent price. The U.S. Energy Information  Administration (EIA) expects the price spread between Brent and WTI to range  between $0 per barrel ($0/b) and $10/b, and will continue to report WTI prices  (a critical reference point for the value of growing production in the U.S.  Midcontinent) as well as the imported refiner acquisition cost for crude oil  (IRAC). The December 2015 decision by the U.S. Congress to remove restrictions  on U.S. crude oil exports also has the potential to narrow the spread between  the Brent price and the price of domestic production streams under certain  cases involving high levels of U.S. crude oil production [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#21">21</a>].</p>
<p>Growing liquids supplies in North America&#8212;especially  from the United States and Canada&#8212;brought almost 7 million b/d of additional  liquid fuels to market between 2008 and 2015. That increase has been offset only  partially by supply disruptions in other oil-producing regions, notably North  Africa and the Middle East. Over the past two years, unplanned crude oil  production outages averaged 3.2 million b/d, according to EIA estimates, and  amounted to 3.4 million b/d in November 2015 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#22">22</a>].  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) member countries  Libya, Iraq, and Iran and non-OPEC countries South Sudan and Syria have  accounted for a sizeable portion of the unplanned outages. It is
difficult to predict when supplies from those nations may  return, given their substantial geopolitical risks, which adds considerable  uncertainty to the projections.</p>
<p>Global liquid fuels production exceeded consumption  beginning in 2014 and reached 95 million b/d in 2015. The surplus production  went into storage, swelling OECD inventories to 2.7 billion barrels in November  2015. Oil markets are expected to remain oversupplied in the short term,  keeping EIA&rsquo;s forecast for annual average prices below $50/b [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#23">23</a>]  through at least 2017.</p>
  <p>In previous instances of oil market oversupply, OPEC members  have cut production to stabilize or increase prices. However, Saudi Arabia, the  only member with substantial spare capacity, is no longer willing to bear the  burden of production cuts alone, and since prices began falling in mid-2014,  OPEC members have not acted together to cut production. Thus, OPEC production  has remained stable and even increased, as OPEC members have attempted both to  maximize revenue in the near term and to preserve market share. The national  economies of many OPEC members are largely dependent on oil revenues, which already  have been cut by the price drop, and OPEC producers have so far been unwilling  to risk further revenue losses by decreasing production.</p>
  <p>Four main factors could provide incentives for a sustained  increase in world liquids production: (1) competition among OPEC member  countries for market share; (2) revenue requirements of liquids-exporting  countries; (3) decreasing service costs; and (4) further technology advances  that lower the cost and raise recovery rates for tight oil development.</p>
  <p>The IEO2016 uses price paths from the <em>Annual Energy Outlook 2015 </em>(AEO2015) Reference case, the AEO2015 Low  Oil Price case, and the AEO2015 High Oil Price case, except for adjustments to the  first few years that were incorporated to reflect the continued declines in crude  oil prices that have occurred since the AEO2015 was published. Oil prices  observed in 2015 and into 2016 more closely resemble prices in the AEO2015 Low  Oil Price case than those in the AEO2015 Reference case. However, oil prices  are expected to return to the AEO2015 Reference case path in the midterm when  demand for liquid fuels returns to the growth rates projected in the IEO2016  Reference case.</p>
  <p>In response to low oil prices, which have reduced expectations  of future revenue (and thus expected profits), capital expenditures for investment  in future production potential have been delayed or canceled. However, many  OPEC and non-OPEC large capital investment projects scheduled to be completed  over the next several years will continue as planned. However, investment is likely  to continue slowing to a point at which producers (outside of tight oil plays),  which provide over 90% of world crude and lease condensate supply will be  unable to respond quickly to future growth in demand for liquids. As a result,  prices are expected to return to the range of $80/b within the next decade. If  supply growth slows as a result of underinvestment, a sustained period of  higher prices may be required to induce additional capital back into the  market. Even then, long project timelines will delay the reentry of some production  from noncontinuous resources into the market.</p>
  <p>World demand for liquid fuels has also been a  key factor in the low world oil prices of the past few years. In non-OECD  countries, strong growth of liquids demand in the early to mid-2000s has  moderated substantially as economic growth in key economies, including China,  India, and Brazil, has slowed. Liquids consumption among OECD countries, which reached  50 million b/d in 2005, has been trending downward generally since that time,  reflecting both growing energy efficiency in the transportation sector and a  lull in demand associated with slow economic growth. However, even with those trends tending to dampen demand growth, world liquid  fuels consumption rises by an annual average of 1.1 million b/d in the IEO2016  Reference case.</p>
  <p>Key influences on consumption and production are  price trends and the reactions of consumers and producers to those trends,  which in turn influence future prices. EIA has developed three price cases to  examine a range of potential interactions of supply, demand, and prices in  world liquid fuels markets: the IEO2016 Reference case and alternative Low Oil  Price case and High Oil Price case (Figure 2-1 and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/table2-1.cfm">Table 2-1</a>). Although the three  oil price cases represent a wide range of future market scenarios, they do not  capture all possible outcomes, and they are not intended to represent a measure  of uncertainty. Because EIA's oil price paths represent market equilibrium  between supply and demand, they do not show the price volatility [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#24">24</a>]  that occurs over days, months, or years.  </p>
  <p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-1.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-1.png" alt="Figure 2-1. North Sea Brent crude oil spot prices in three cases, 1990â€“2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure2-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p> 
      <p>In  the IEO2016 Reference case, world consumption of petroleum and other liquid  fuels increases from 90 million b/d in 2012 to 100 million b/d in 2020 and 121  million b/d in 2040. Compared with the IEO2014, the IEO2016 incorporates a  smaller increase in production from non-OPEC producers, particularly the United  States, because of the effects of the drop in the oil prices that began in  mid-2014. The IEO2016 Reference case assumes that OPEC countries maintain or increase their combined market share of world liquid fuels  production rather than cut production. Total OPEC liquid fuels production  represents between 39% and 43% of total world production throughout the  projection.</p>
<p>In comparison with the IEO2014, production of  tight oil is particularly affected by the recent drop in oil prices. Still, the  largest new supplies of tight oil are projected to come from the United States&#8212;with  Canada, Russia, and Argentina, among other countries, also beginning to produce  tight oil in the IEO2016 Reference case. In 2040, total production of tight oil  outside the United States remains below U.S. production in the IEO2016  Reference case (Figure 2-2).</p>

          <h4>Shale oil and  tight gas: Recent developments outside North America</h4>
In 2014, only four countries&#8212;the United States,  Canada, Argentina, and China&#8212;were producing commercial volumes of either  natural gas from shale formations (shale gas) or crude oil from shale or other tight  formations (tight oil). Since the beginning of 2014, China has drilled more  than 200 shale gas and tight oil wells, and Argentina has drilled more than 275  shale gas and tight oil wells. Those two countries led shale resource  development outside North America in the first half of 2015, and both have the  potential to increase production significantly (Figure 2-3) [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#25">25</a>]. In addition, Algeria, Australia, Colombia, Mexico, Poland, and Russia also  began exploring and producing hydrocarbons from shale and other tight resources  in 2015, but they are still short of reaching commercial production.<span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-3.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-3.png" alt="Figure 2-3. EIA/ARI assessments of shale gas and tight oil resources in Argentinaâ€™s Nequen Basin and Chinaâ€™s Sichuan Basin" width="322" /></a></span></p>

<p>In Argentina, many international companies hold leases and have drilled wells in shale formations. Much of the initial activity has targeted shale oil and natural gas in the Neuquen Basin's Vaca Muerta Shale formation, located in west-central Argentina. National energy company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), the largest shale operator in the country, reported production in April 2015 of 22,900 b/d of oil and 67 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas from three joint ventures in Vaca Muerta: one with Chevron at the Loma Campana field, a second with Dow Chemical at the El Orejano field, and a third with Petronas at La Amarga Chica field. In addition, China's national oil company Sinopec and Russia's national oil company Gazprom have recently signed a memorandum of understanding with YPF for the joint development of shale resources from the same basin.</p>
<p>China has identified the Longmaxi formation in the Sichuan Basin, located in south-central China, as its initial shale gas exploration and development objective. Although several international companies are active in China, much of the early effort has been led by two of Chinaâ€™s national oil companies&#8212;Sinopec and PetroChina (owned by the China National Petroleum Corporation [CNPC]). According to China's Ministry of Land and Resources, the two companies are on schedule to reach 600 MMcf/d of shale gas production by the end of 2015. Sinopec has a commercial-scale effort underway at the Fuling Shale gas field in the Sichuan Basin, currently producing 130 MMcf/d. By the end of 2014, Sinopec had completed 75 test wells at the Fuling field, with plans to drill an additional 253 wells. CNPC has drilled 125 shale wells and brought 74 of them into production and is scheduled to produce 250 MMcf/d of shale gas by the end of 2015.</p>
 
      
        </div>
        
      <p>Production  of other liquids increases by an average of 1.5%/year in the IEO2016 Reference  case&#8212;50% faster than crude and lease condensate production. The growth in other  liquid supplies is attributed in part to the coproducts of natural gas production (i.e., NGPL) and to government policies aimed  at increasing the use of alternative liquid fuels in the transportation sector.  Other liquids account for between 16% and 18% of total liquid supplies  throughout the projection.</p>
<p>The High Oil Price case assumes faster economic growth among  emerging non-OECD nations that contributes to higher world demand for petroleum  and other liquid fuels. On the supply side, the High Oil Price case assumes  less upstream investment by OPEC and a return to cartel-like behavior, and it  assumes higher non-OPEC exploration and development costs. As a result, the  average spot market price for Brent crude oil rises to $252/b in 2040, or 78%  above the IEO2016 Reference case price in 2040.</p>
<p>The reverse is true in the Low Oil Price case. Slower  economic growth leads to lower non-OECD demand for liquid fuels, while higher  upstream investment and production and non-cartel behavior in OPEC, as well as lower  non-OPEC exploration and development costs, contribute to increased supply from  both OPEC and non-OPEC countries. As a result, the Brent spot price rises more  slowly than in the IEO2016 Reference case, to $76/b in 2040, or 47% below the IEO2016  Reference case price in 2040.</p>
<p>The discussion presented here provides an  overview of both the production and consumption of liquid fuels in the three  price cases, as summarized in the notional supply and demand curves for 2040 shown  in Figure 2-4. The oil price path in each of the three cases is derived from an  internally consistent, illustrative scenario of supply and demand. However, other  combinations of supply and/or demand could result in similar paths, and EIA  does not evaluate the likelihood of either the price paths themselves or the  scenarios upon which they are based. Each price case represents one of  potentially many combinations of supply and demand that would result in the same  price path. Because each case represents a potentially feasible equilibrium  outcome, EIA does not assign probabilities to any of the oil price cases and  does not consider that these three cases represent the range of all possible  outcomes. The following section reviews each of the three price cases, their  assumptions and indicative trends, and the potential effects of each set of  factors on future liquids markets.</p>

      <h3>IEO2016 Reference case</h3>
      <p>The IEO2016 Reference case reflects global oil market events  through the end of 2015. Over the past two years, growth in U.S. crude oil  production, along with the late-2014 drop in global crude oil prices, has  altered the economics of the oil market. The new market conditions are assumed  to continue in the IEO2016 Reference case, with the average Brent price  dropping from $113/b in 2012 to below $50/b in 2015. After 2017, growth in demand from non-OECD countries results in a return  to higher world oil prices, and the Brent price rises to $141/b in 2040.</p>
      <h4>World petroleum and other liquid fuels consumption</h4>
      <p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, world liquid  fuels consumption increases by about one-third (31 million b/d), from 90  million b/d in 2012 to 121 million b/d in 2040. In the medium to long term, oil  prices rise as demand from the emerging, non-OECD economies continues to grow,  especially in the transportation sector and also in the industrial sector.  Long-term sustained increases in oil prices encourage consumers outside the  transportation and industrial sectors to shift away from liquid fuels to more  cost-competitive fuels wherever possible. The largest decrease in liquids  consumption occurs in the electric power sector, where renewable fuels, natural  gas, and nuclear power are substituted for liquids in many parts of the world. </p>
      <div class="tie_correction">
        <h4>Effects of regulation on world demand for residual fuel oil</h4>
        <p>Throughout the world,  residual fuel oil (RFO) is used in many sectors, including in marine  transportation, power generation, in commercial furnaces and boilers, and in various  industrial processes. Also, in some areas RFO is used as a relatively low-cost fuel  for space heating. RFO is one of several residuals that remain after lighter  materials, including gasoline and distillate, are distilled from crude oil. RFO  contains large amounts of contaminants, including sulfur, nitrogen, and heavy  metals. Because of its high viscosity, RFO generally is either blended with  lighter streams or heated to ensure that it can be pumped.</p>
        <p>RFO plays an important role in the global market  for liquid fuels because its price is normally below that of other liquids. However,  health and environmental concerns related to the high sulfur content of RFO  have led to new policies and regulations that have significantly lowered  expectations for its use in the future (Figure 2-5). As demand for RFO  declines, refining upgrades will be needed to convert residual material to  lighter, cleaner products.</p>
        <p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-5.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-5.png" alt="Figure 2-5. World consumption of residual fuel oil, 1986â€“2012" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure2-5_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
     <p>Large reductions in demand for RFO are likely to come from decreases in its use for power generation and for space heating. In the power sector, the cost of pollution controls, maintenance, and RFO heating often offset the lower cost of RFO in comparison with natural gas and other more expensive fuels. Consequently, power sector demand for RFO, especially in industrialized countries, is expected to decrease, although it may continue to serve as a transitional fuel in the power sectors of non-OECD countries that may be more sensitive to price and less sensitive to environmental and health implications. Additional significant reductions in RFO demand could come from the implementation of rules set by Annex VI of the International Maritime Organization through the International Convention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol) [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#26">26</a>]. Since 2012, Marpol regulations have required controls on emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides worldwide. The regulations are based on emissions associated with fuel combustion rather than on the fuels themselves. As a result, some marine transportation operators are considering the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative fuel for ships operating along routes where LNG is available.</p>
<p>Because few refineries are capable of removing sulfur from RFO, Marpol compliance is likely to be achieved by two approaches: using fuels with lower sulfur content (such as marine gasoil and intermediate fuel oil) and using scrubbers or other technologies to remove sulfur from the exhaust of combustion processes. The levels stipulated by the Marpol regulations can be met by using RFO with sulfur levels of no more than 3.5%. The rules also set more stringent requirements&#8212;consistent with RFO sulfur levels of no more than 0.1%&#8212;in designated Emissions Control Areas (ECAs), which include the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the coastal areas of North America and the Caribbean Sea. A 2016 study is intended to evaluate the probable availability and pricing of various compliance options for the use of RFO in non-ECA areas [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#27">27</a>]. The study should yield a decision, no later than 2018, on when the implementation of RFO reduction standards establishing sulfur emissions levels of no more than 0.5% will go into effect&#8212;either in 2020 or in 2025 (Figure 2-6).</p>

      <p>Economic growth is among the most important factors to be  considered in projecting changes in world energy consumption. In the IEO2016,  assumptions about regional economic growth&#8212;measured in terms of real GDP  expressed in purchasing power parity [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#28">28</a>]&#8212;underlie  the projections of regional demand for liquid fuels. World GDP increases by  3.3%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, slightly lower than  the average 3.5%/year increase in GDP that occurred between 1990 and 2012. Over  the projection, economic growth in the non-OECD regions, averaging 4.2%/year, exceeds  the OECD average of 2.0%/year.</p>
<p>Non-OECD regions account for essentially all the  growth in liquid fuels consumption in the IEO2016 Reference case (Figure 2-7  and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/table2-2.cfm">Table 2-2</a>). In particular, non-OECD Asia and the Middle East account for  about 75% of the world increase in liquids consumption from 2012 to 2040, with  Africa and the non-OECD Americas each accounting for about 10% of the world  increase (Figure 2-8). Fast-paced economic expansion among the non-OECD regions  drives the increase in demand for liquid fuels, as strong growth in income per  capita results in increased demand for personal and freight transportation, as  well as demand for energy in the industrial sector.</p>

       <p>OECD demand for liquid fuels does not grow over the  projection period, as the mature economies react to sustained high fuel prices  over the long term with strong efficiency gains (especially in personal  transportation) and conservation. Although technology efficiency improvements  and fuel-switching opportunities also are available to non-OECD consumers, the  scale of growth in demand for transportation services in relatively  underdeveloped transportation networks overwhelms the mitigating impact of  those efficiency improvements.</p>
       <h4>OECD</h4>
<p>For most of the OECD countries, consumption of  petroleum and other liquid fuels remains flat or declines in the IEO2016  Reference case (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-7.png">see Figure 2-7</a>). At 46 million b/d in 2040, total OECD liquid  fuels consumption is only 0.6 million b/d higher than in 2012. In much of the  OECD, slow economic growth and static or declining population levels contribute  to lower levels of liquids consumption. In addition, many OECD governments have  adopted policies that mandate improvements in the efficiency of motor vehicles,  and consumers turn to more fuel-efficient transportation choices as high oil  prices return in the long term. Efficiency gains could also lower  freight-related energy demand. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  recently proposed a significant increase in fuel economy standards for heavy  trucks.</p>
<p>Should these proposed standards be adopted as final rules,  they would significantly lower projections for diesel fuel use in trucks. To  the extent that these standards are implemented and affect trucks sold  throughout the world, the reduction in trucking fuel use could be greatly  magnified.</p>
<p>The United States is currently the OECD's largest consumer  of liquid fuels, and it remains so through 2040. The use of liquid fuels in the  U.S. transportation sector declines over the projection period as a result of  significantly lower energy use by light-duty vehicles. However, the decline is  moderated by increased energy use for heavy-duty vehicles, aircraft, and marine  vessels. Over the course of the projection period, increases in vehicle fuel  economy offset growth in transportation activity. Industrial sector demand for  liquid fuels in the United States grows over the projection period, mainly  because of increased use of hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGL)&#8212;primarily ethane and  propane&#8212;as feedstocks in the bulk chemicals industry. Total liquid fuels  consumption in the United States rises from 18.5 million b/d in 2012 to 19.7  million b/d in the early 2020s, then declines to 19.3 million b/d in 2040.</p>
<p>In Canada, fuel efficiency gains result in relatively flat  consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels, between 2.4 million b/d and  2.5 million b/d throughout the projection period. In Mexico and Chile combined,  liquid fuels consumption increases by 0.6%/year&#8212;the highest growth rate among  the OECD regions except for Australia and New Zealand. Despite improvements in  vehicle fuel efficiency, the use of liquid fuels increases in Mexico and Chile,  particularly for transportation services (as the infrastructure is still relatively  underdeveloped) and for industrial production as demand grows.</p>
<p>In OECD Europe, consumption of liquid fuels remains stable,  largely as a result of improvements in energy efficiency. In addition to  improvements in motor vehicle fuel efficiency, most of the nations in OECD  Europe have high taxes on motor fuels, well-established public transportation  systems, and declining or slowly growing populations, all of which slow the  growth of transportation energy use. In 2040, liquid fuels consumption in OECD  Europe totals 14.0 million b/d, or 0.1 million b/d lower than the 2012 level of  14.1 million b/d.</p>
<p>Petroleum and other liquid fuels consumption in OECD Asia  generally declines over the long term, from 8.2 million b/d in 2012 to 7.5  million b/d in 2040. Over the past few years, the region&rsquo;s liquid fuels  consumption rose, largely because of increased fuel use in Japan's electric  power sector after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that severely damaged  nuclear reactors at Fukushima Daiichi and subsequently led to the shutdown of  all the country&rsquo;s nuclear power reactors by May 2012. To compensate for the  loss of nuclear generation, Japan turned, in part, to oil-fired generation to  meet demand for electricity in the short term. Consumption of petroleum and  other liquid fuels for power generation increased by an estimated 20% from 2011  to 2012 but has fallen as some nuclear capacity has returned to operation, and as  renewable generating capacity has grown. With Japan&rsquo;s use of liquid fuels for  power generation returning to more typical levels, the country&rsquo;s overall trend  of decreasing consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels resumes in the  medium term.</p>
<p>Outside of Japan, the other countries of OECD  Asia&#8212;South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand&#8212;experience some growth in liquids  fuels use, attributed mostly to expanding activity in the transportation and  industrial sectors. In Australia and New Zealand, expected population growth  rates also contribute to a rise in demand for liquid fuels. Together, the two  countries are projected to account for the largest increase in demand among the  OECD countries in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>
       <h4>Non-OECD</h4>
<p>The non-OECD share of world liquid fuels  consumption grows from 50% in 2012 to 54% in 2020 and to 62% in 2040. Non-OECD  Asia shows the largest growth in liquid fuels consumption worldwide in the IEO2016  Reference case, at 17.4 million b/d from 2012 to 2040, with China accounting  for 6.2 million b/d of the total increase. As China&rsquo;s economy moves from  dependence on energy-intensive industrial manufacturing to services, the  transportation sector becomes the most significant source of growth in liquid  fuels use. The country&rsquo;s liquid fuels consumption increases by 61% over the  course of the projection period.</p>
<div class="tie_correction">
  <h4>Industrial CO2 emissions and petroleum coke use in refineries</h4><p>EIA has identified possible  discrepancies in the international reporting of data on fuels consumed in the  petroleum refining sector that may result in underestimation of energy-related emissions  of greenhouse gases (GHG). Petroleum refining is one of the world&rsquo;s most  energy-intensive industries, and as demand for petroleum products in non-OECD  countries continues to grow, their refining industries are adding capacity to  process more crude oil into gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum-based  products. Evolving crude oil inputs, changing market demands, and increasingly  stringent emissions regulations all affect the refining process. As an  energy-intensive industry, petroleum refining also is a significant source of  GHG emissions, and understanding and tracking the industry&rsquo;s fuel use is  essential to understanding its contribution to global GHG emissions.</p>
  <p>Energy consumption by  refineries includes both purchased fuels and internally derived fuels drawn  from the crude oil refining process itself. Petroleum coke (<em>petcoke</em>) is a refinery product that  takes the form of a solid, carbon-rich substance resembling coal. There are two  kinds of petcoke: <em>catalyst </em>and<em> marketable</em>. Most refineries worldwide  produce both types of petcoke, with differences in production levels resulting  from different refinery configurations and crude oil inputs. Heavier crudes  typically yield higher petroleum coke production.</p>
<p>Catalyst petcoke, or <em>catcoke</em>, is a byproduct from refinery fluid  catalytic cracking (FCC) units. Catcoke is burned off the catalyst matrix  (generally, pellets or finer sand-sized particles) to maintain catalytic  activity, providing energy for FCC processes. Catcoke cannot be collected and  sold. Rather, it must be burned onsite as refinery fuel. Catcoke is a  significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Marketable petcoke, on  the other hand, is produced in coker units. Petcoke is collected and processed  in sizable chunks by the refinery and marketed for various uses, such as fuel  for cement kilns and power generators. Marketable petcoke also is widely used  for nonfuel purposes, especially for conversion to carbon anodes used in  aluminum production. When either type is burned, sizable amounts of CO2 are  released, along with sulfur and volatile heavy metals. In some countries,  including the United States, air quality regulations have made the burning of marketable  petcoke prohibitively expensive. As a result, there has been an increase in  U.S. exports of marketable petcoke, with more than 14% of the 2012 total delivered  to China [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#29">29</a>].</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) historical  database, among other compilations, provides data on the world supply of  marketable petcoke, including production, trade, and consumption data for most  nations. Many countries appear to omit catcoke consumption, possibly because it  is not sold as a marketed fuel. For those that do report catcoke consumption,  there often is no distinction between marketable petcoke and catcoke in the IEA  database. However, it appears that most OECD nations (Chile, Mexico, and Poland  are a few of the exceptions) provide data for consumption
of both marketable and  catalyst petcoke in the refining sector, the latter likely representing most  petroleum coke consumption.</p>
<p>Other nations (including China,  Russia, Brazil, and most of the other non-OECD nations) provide data for their  petroleum coke supply but not for their refining sector consumption. All of  these countries have some FCC units in their refineries, and it is possible  that the catalyst coke portion of total petroleum coke consumption is not  reported because it is burned in domestic refineries. This situation would  cause CO2 emissions for some countries to be underestimated.</p>
<p>China is one country that does  not report data on refinery consumption of petcoke. One possible way to  estimate its consumption may be to assume that refining operations in the  United States and China are not significantly different. If so, one would  expect the American and Chinese systems to use about the same amount of energy  per barrel of crude oil processed. Total U.S. production of petroleum catcoke  (which is equal to refinery consumption of petcoke) is reported to be in the  range of 200,000 b/d to 250,000 b/d, equivalent to about 0.1 million Btu of  catcoke per barrel of crude processed in U.S. refineries. This value,  multiplied by China's crude oil inputs, could provide a first-order  approximation of catcoke consumption in China&rsquo;s refineries.</p>
<p>China's production and consumption of catcoke  appear to be missing in official state statistics. According to IEA data, there  is no reported refinery consumption of either petroleum coke type in China&rsquo;s  refineries, which seems unlikely in view of its substantial FCC capacity.  Moreover, if the missing refinery fuel is catcoke, and if the United States and  China produce roughly the same amount of catcoke per barrel in their FCC units,  the unreported catcoke alone is not enough to balance the production equations.  Consistent with a recent report on the petcoke market in China [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#30">30</a>],  it seems likely that some of China's refineries are using their own marketable  petcoke for refinery fuel rather than selling it to outside buyers. Based on  recent estimates of China&rsquo;s total marketable petcoke consumption (30 million  metric tons in 2012) and the likely fraction of that total employed for fuel  and power purposes, it is estimated that 0.08 million Btu per barrel of  refinery fuel use in China is marketable petcoke (Figure 2-9).</p>

  <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure2-9_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p></span>
  <p>If the  consumption of catcoke and marketable petcoke is not included in the estimation  of energy consumption at China's refineries, then GHG emissions from China&rsquo;s  refining sector would be underestimated. Based on the analysis summarized here,  EIA has incorporated its estimates of marketable petcoke consumed as refinery  fuel in the IEO2016 baseline estimates of China&rsquo;s industrial sector energy consumption.  Further, China may not be the only example of a country whose consumption of  catcoke or petroleum coke goes unreported. Better estimates of refinery  consumption of catcoke and petroleum coke fuel, not only for China but  elsewhere as well, would enable construction of a more accurate baseline for  world industrial sector CO2 emissions in the future.</p>

<p>India's GDP increases by 5.5%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the  IEO2016 Reference case&#8212;the highest economic growth rate among all the IEO  regions. In recent years, India&rsquo;s government has committed to a number of  economic and structural reforms that will support the strong projected growth  in GDP over the medium to long term. On the other hand, the government&rsquo;s  continued efforts to reduce subsidies on petroleum products are expected to  temper demand for liquid fuels. In the IEO2016 Reference case, consumption of  petroleum and other liquid fuels in India more than doubles, from 3.6 million b/d  in 2012 to 8.3 million b/d in 2040, as its GDP more than quadruples over the  period.</p>
<p>  Liquid fuels demand in the Middle East grows substantially  in the IEO2016 Reference case, by 5.5 million b/d from 2012 to 2040, as a  result of strong population growth rates and rising incomes. In addition,  liquids-intensive processes in the region&rsquo;s industrial sector, particularly in  the chemicals industry, are an important component of its growing demand for liquid  fuels. Delays in petroleum subsidy reforms in much of the region and strong  growth in per capita incomes support a significant expansion of liquid fuels  consumption in the region&rsquo;s transportation sector. Some subsidy reforms are  assumed to occur in the later years of the projection, with the resulting  higher prices slowing the region's growth in demand for liquid fuels.</p>
<p>Demand for liquid fuels in the Middle East  region's electric power sector declines from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case. Many of the countries in the region that produce liquid fuels  increasingly turn to lower-cost natural gas and, to a lesser extent, nuclear  and renewable fuels to increase the volumes of petroleum available for export  and to meet  demand for fuel in the transportation and industrial sectors. The timing of the  Middle East shift from its reliance on liquid fuels for power generation  remains uncertain, however, as the region faces delays in infrastructure improvements,  and because there are limits on the supply of alternative fuels for power  generation. For instance, Saudi Arabia has been unable to meet rapid growth in  electricity demand with power generated from domestic natural gas and has had  to import fuel oil for power generation.</p>
<p>As in the Middle East, growing populations and economies in  African countries increase the demand for liquid fuels for both transportation  and industrial uses over the IEO2016 projection. In the IEO2016 Reference case,  Africa&rsquo;s consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels grows by 3.3 million b/d  from 2012 to 2040, as its real GDP increases by 4.7%/year from 2012 to 2040.  With an expected favorable investment environment and relative political  stability in the long term, growing consumer demand is projected to increase demand  for consumer goods and services and to increase demand for liquid fuels,  particularly for personal transportation and freight services. The  transportation sector accounts for 60% of the total increase in liquid fuels  use in Africa in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>
<p>In Brazil and the other non-OECD Americas, consumption of  liquid fuels increases by 2.9 million b/d, from 6.7 million b/d in 2012 to 9.6  million b/d in 2040. In some of the region&rsquo;s national economies&mdash;notably Brazil,  Colombia, and Peru&mdash;long-term economic expansion is expected to support growing  demand for liquid fuels, primarily for transportation uses but also in the  industrial sector. Brazil, with the region&rsquo;s largest economy, accounts for  about 60% of the regional growth in liquid fuels demand in the IEO2016 Reference  case. Economies that are less financially secure, including Venezuela and  Argentina, will have a more difficult time sustaining economic growth. Fuel  subsidies in Venezuela, in particular, are costly, and it is difficult to  anticipate when the Venezuelan government might be able to reduce the subsidies.</p>
<p>In the countries of non-OECD Europe and Eurasia, demand for  liquid fuels grows moderately from 2012 to 2020 in the IEO2016 Reference case before  reaching a plateau. Russia&mdash;the largest economy in the region&mdash;currently accounts  for the largest share of the region&rsquo;s consumption of liquid fuels, but as a  result of major efficiency improvements in its energy-intensive industrial  sector its consumption increases more slowly than in the region&rsquo;s other economies.  In addition, demand for liquid fuels in Russia&rsquo;s residential and commercial  sectors is projected to slow as fuel subsidies for people living in areas with  high heating requirements are reduced.</p>
<h4>World petroleum and other liquid fuels supplies</h4>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, world petroleum and other  liquid fuels supplies depend on various sources, including OPEC and non-OPEC  crude oil and lease condensate supply as well as other liquids supply. <em>Crude oil and lease condensate</em> includes  tight oil, extra-heavy oil, field condensate, and bitumen (i.e., oil sands,  either diluted or upgraded); <em>other  liquids supply</em> refers to NGPL, biofuels, CTL, GTL, kerogen, and refinery  gain.</p>
<h4>OPEC crude oil and lease condensate supply</h4>
<p>The IEO2016 Reference case assumes that OPEC maintains or  increases its market share of global oil production, and that no geopolitical  circumstances will cause prolonged supply shocks in the OPEC countries that  could further limit production growth. Crude oil and lease condensate supplies  from OPEC and non-OPEC sources increase by 23 million b/d in the IEO2016  Reference case, from 76 million b/d in 2012 to 100 million b/d in 2040. OPEC  member countries account for 13 million b/d, and non-OPEC countries account for  10 million b/d of the total increase in crude oil and lease condensate production.  Production of other liquid fuels increases from 14 million b/d in 2012 to 21  million b/d in 2040.</p>
<p>The IEO2016 Reference case assumes that OPEC  producers invest in incremental production capacity, which enables them to  increase crude oil and lease condensate production by 13 million b/d from 2012  to 2040 (Figure 2-10) and also enables  them to account for 42% to 47% of total crude and lease condensate production  worldwide over the course of the projection period. Middle East OPEC member  countries, which accounted for nearly 70% of total OPEC crude and lease  condensate production in 2012 (Figure 2-11), increase their crude and lease  condensate production by 12 million b/d in the IEO2016 Reference case,  accounting for 94% of the total growth in OPEC crude and lease condensate  production from 2012 to 2040.</p>

  <h4>Iran's return to the international oil market</h4>
  <p>Implementation  Day for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement among Iran,  the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and  Germany), and the European Union (EU), occurred on January 16, 2016, when the  International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran had completed the key  physical steps required to trigger sanctions relief. With this milestone, the  United States, the EU, and the United Nations lifted nuclear-related sanctions against  Iran, which included oil-related sanctions that limited Iran's ability to sell  its oil on the global market since late 2011. With nuclear-related sanctions  being lifted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some Iranian banks can rejoin the Society for  Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system to conduct  financial transactions electronically on the world market.</li>
    <li>Iran can access its foreign cash reserves held  in banks worldwide. According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, Iran&rsquo;s  Central Bank has between $100 billion and $125 billion in foreign exchange  assets globally, but its usable liquid assets are estimated at slightly more  than $50 billion.</li>
    <li>Non-U.S. companies can invest in Iran&rsquo;s oil and  natural gas industry, including the sale, supply, and transfer of equipment and  technology.</li>
    <li>Countries within the EU and elsewhere can import  oil, natural gas, and petrochemical products from Iran, and countries already  importing from Iran can increase their purchases.</li>
    <li>European Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;I)  Clubs can provide insurance and reinsurance for Iranian oil tankers.</li></ul>
  <p>Previously imposed U.S.  primary sanctions related to human rights abuses and terrorism remain in place,  and some Iranian citizens and entities that were delisted under nuclear  sanctions as a result of the JCPOA agreement will remain listed under these  primary sanctions. In addition, the United States has imposed new sanctions on  individuals and entities linked to recent ballistic missile tests by Iran [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#31">31</a>].  As a result, non-U.S. companies may be slow to rush back into Iran until they  determine how they can resume business without violating the prevailing  sanctions. U.S. companies remain precluded from conducting business with Iran,  with the exception of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms that receive  case-by-case approvals from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>
    <p>Although its crude oil  exports were nearly halved by sanctions between 2011 and 2014, Iran still ranks  among the world&rsquo;s top 10 producers of oil and among the top 5 producers of  natural gas. Iran&rsquo;s crude oil production has been relatively flat over the past  three years, averaging 2.8 million barrels per day (b/d) and representing 9% of  OPEC&rsquo;s total crude oil production [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#32">32</a>].  Iran's total liquids production in 2015 amounted to nearly 3.5 million b/d,  and its total production of dry natural gas in 2013 was estimated at 5.7  trillion cubic feet [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#33">33</a>].  Iran is the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest holder of oil reserves (nearly 158 billion  barrels) and the world&rsquo;s second-largest holder of natural gas reserves (1.2  trillion cubic feet) [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#34">34</a>].</p>
<p>The pace at which Iran will ramp up its exports  now that sanctions have been lifted is uncertain. Iran has a considerable  amount of oil stored offshore in tankers (between 30 million and 50 million  barrels, most of which is condensate) and at onshore facilities. Initial  post-sanction increases in Iran&rsquo;s exports are likely to come from storage, with  meaningful production increases occurring after some of the storage has been  cleared. Most of the production growth is expected to come from crude oil  production capacity that currently is shut in, and the remainder is expected to  come from newly
developed fields. Iranian  and Chinese companies have been developing a number of new oil fields in Iran  over the past several years, which have the potential to add 100,000 b/d to  200,000 b/d of crude oil production capacity by 2017.</p>
<p>In addition to crude oil,  Iran's current production of condensate and NGPL totals nearly 750,000 b/d, of  which 75% is condensate and the remainder NGPL. Iran&rsquo;s noncrude liquids  production has grown over the past few years, with its main buyers in Asia  (mainly China) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Currently, there is an  oversupply of condensate on the global market as a result of increased  production from Australia, the United States, and the Middle East. Iran has had  difficulty selling the condensate it produces both because of the oversupply  and because of its high sulfur content. As a result, the condensate has been  sold at a discount [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#35">35</a>].  Iran's production of other liquids is expected to grow by 150,000 b/d by the  end of 2016 and by an additional 100,000 b/d by the end of 2017, as more  project phases at the South Pars natural gas field come online.</p>
<p>Iran has the potential to  add almost 2 million b/d of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas plant  liquids to the global market over the next five years. However, the global oil  market already is oversupplied, and EIA projects that oil inventories will  continue to build throughout 2016 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#36">36</a>].  Consequently, Iran&rsquo;s ability to increase its crude oil sales may be limited by  global demand and the availability of buyers.</p>
<p>Actual production growth  after 2017 will depend on Iran&rsquo;s ability to attract foreign investment that  will provide access to better technology, a higher level of expertise, and more  financing opportunities. Iran recently modified its contract structure in hopes  of increasing joint development of its oil and natural gas fields by both  international and Iranian oil companies. Iran&rsquo;s restrictive buyback contracts  will be replaced by a new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC), which was formally  introduced in Tehran, Iran, in November 2015 (although the final draft of the  IPC has not been released). Notable changes include allowing foreign companies  to book reserves in Iran in some cases (although they will not be permitted to  own fields [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#37">37</a>])  and increasing contract durations to as much as 25 years (which will allow IOCs  to participate beyond exploration and development and into the production and  secondary recovery phases). Under the IPC, fees and bonuses will be based on a  project&rsquo;s associated risks. At the Tehran conference in November 2015, Iran  unveiled a list of 53 oil and natural gas projects, along with 18 exploration  blocks, which it hopes will attract at least $30 billion in foreign investment<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#38">38</a>].</p>
<p>There are notable risks associated with Iran&rsquo;s  production outlook. The JCPOA includes a dispute resolution process and guidance  for the <em>snap back</em> of sanctions if  Iran strays from its commitments. As a result, there is a possibility that  sanctions could be reinstated, which adds a downside risk to Iran&rsquo;s production  outlook. In addition, the involvement of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  (IRGC) in Iran&rsquo;s oil and natural gas industry complicates the outlook for  foreign investment. The IRGC, which is subject to U.S. sanctions related to  sponsorship of international terrorism, maintains ownership interests in many  of Iran&rsquo;s service sector companies, presenting a potential problem for foreign  companies that want to use Iranian contractors.</p>

  <p>Algeria is currently the  third-largest oil producer (after Nigeria and Angola) in Africa and is also the  continent&rsquo;s largest natural gas producer. Over the past decade, however, Algeria&rsquo;s  production of both oil (Figure 2-12) and natural gas (Figure 2-13) has declined,  leading the Algerian government to amend its law on foreign investment in hydrocarbons  in an attempt to attract the investment and technology improvements needed to  help stop production declines. In 2014, after the Algerian Council of Ministers  gave formal approval for foreign partners to join the national oil and natural gas  company, Sonatrach, in exploring and developing shale gas resources, Sonatrach  offered 33 blocks in four sedimentary basins with high shale gas and oil  potential to foreign bidders. Following the auction, the company signed five  contracts with Repsol, Shell, Statoil, and Dragon Oil-Enel. By law, Sonatrach  takes a majority share (at least 51%) of any resulting projects.</p>

      <p>Algeria  has large proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas, as well as resources  that already are connected to world markets through an extensive natural gas  pipeline network (Figure 2-14). In addition, Algeria's large shipping fleet transports  liquefied natural gas (LNG) from several liquefaction plants to customers in  Europe and elsewhere. Proved crude  oil reserves in Algeria totaled 12.2 billion barrels in 2014. In addition, the U.S.  Geological Survey (USGS) has estimated the country&rsquo;s undiscovered oil and NGL  resources at 9.8 billion barrels, while EIA and Advanced Resources  International (EIA/ARI) have estimated close to 6 billion barrels of  technically recoverable shale oil resources. Proved natural gas reserves  totaled 159 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2014, with an additional 49 Tcf of  undiscovered natural gas resources estimated by USGS and more than 700 Tcf of  technically recoverable shale gas resources estimated by EIA/ARI.</p>

      <p>Early this year, Sonatrach announced plans to spend $64 billion, or 70% of its total investment program from 2015 to 2018, in upstream activities to reverse the decline in crude oil and natural gas production in Algeria. Sonatrach set a target to increase gross hydrocarbon output from 1,429 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) in 2014 to 1,649 MMBOE by 2019 (from 535 MMBOE to 616 MMBOE of oil and from 894 to 1,034 MMBOE of natural gas).</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Sonatrach has intensified its exploration activities, drilling 275 oil and natural gas wells and seismically mapping large areas of the country with an estimated investment of $30 billion, and has conducted its own shale resource assessment and started exploration activities. The first two vertical shale exploratory wells drilled by Sonatrach in 2012 confirmed the potential for shale gas, and since 2014 Sonatrach has been engaged in a pilot project in the shale gas-rich Ahnet basin to drill, hydraulically fracture, and analyze three horizontal wells with up to 14 hydraulic fracturing stages.</p>
<p>While the government is seeking to reduce Algeriaâ€™s dependence on oil and natural gas revenue, it has also made repeated calls for more investment in the sector. However, civil unrest and some opposition to the governmentâ€™s commercialization of shale resources may present obstacles to attracting foreign investment. Security is also a major concern, particularly following the attacks that took place at the Tigantourine natural gas processing plant in Illizi Province, near Algeriaâ€™s eastern border with Libya, in January 2013.</p>

<h4>Non-OPEC crude and lease condensate supply</h4>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, non-OPEC production of crude oil  and lease condensate increases steadily, from 43 million b/d in 2012 to 48  million b/d in 2020 and 53 million b/d in 2040. The average cost per barrel of  non-OPEC oil production rises as production volumes increase, and those cost  increases, along with falling investment in exploration and production, eventually  slow production growth in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>
<p>U.S. tight oil production, which reached 4.6  million b/d in May 2015 and is estimated to have declined to 4.3 million b/d in  February 2016 has proven more resilient in the face of low prices than many market  watchers initially anticipated. However, tight oil makes up only a small  portion of total non-OPEC supply of crude and lease condensate, which was  estimated at roughly 45 million b/d in the first quarter of 2016. Given the  long investment cycle for many projects outside of shale plays, the current  decline in investment can have long-term effects. Delays and cancelations of  planned projects are expected to continue for the next several years,  especially for projects with high development costs, such as Canadian oil sands  and large offshore projects. Some existing production capacity has also begun  coming offline in 2015 as well. For example, a number of fields in the North  Sea have been closed earlier than originally planned. Resources with the  highest operating costs and most strained financing are expected to be the  first to come offline. These resources include tight oil, stripper wells, and  fields that experience equipment failures&#8212;all of which require ongoing capital  investments to offset declines in production from existing wells.</p>

  <h4>Update on Mexico's petroleum sector reforms</h4>
  <p>In  December 2013, Mexico took the first step toward reforming its energy sector by  amending its constitution to open the sector to external investment. Since  then, the Mexican parliament has passed secondary laws and instituted a  regulatory framework to manage the newly restructured sector. The secondary  laws passed in 2014 included the Hydrocarbons Law, which created institutional  frameworks for the oil sector, along with a process for auctioning contracts; the  Hydrocarbons Revenue Law, which established fiscal, legal, and regulatory  regimes for the auctioned contracts; and subsidiary regulations on  implementation, published in October 2014. The Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de Hidrocarburos  (CNH, or Hydrocarbons Commission), which was established to implement the  reforms, began conducting bid rounds in 2015 to auction rights for the exploration  and development of Mexico&rsquo;s oil resources.</p>
      <p>The petroleum sector reforms are intended  to encourage foreign investment to help reverse recent declines in Mexico&rsquo;s oil  production and to develop a healthy and diverse exploration and production  (E&amp;P) industry. The main objective of the process was to maximize  hydrocarbon-related revenue to the state, rather than the number of contract  blocks awarded [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#39">39</a>]. However,  the price of oil has fallen by nearly 65% since June 2014, and E&amp;P spending  has declined globally as companies seek to cover revenue shortfalls [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#40">40</a>].  Concerns about regulatory, contract, or administrative structure on the part of  companies or their investors are amplified in the present environment of low  oil prices, and investment has fallen precipitously in new projects that will  not result in demonstrable production for several years.</p>
 <p>The bid round process (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/table2-3.cfm">Table 2-3</a>) began in  August 2014 with Round Zero, in which PetrÃ³leos Mexicanos (Pemex) received the  right of first refusal (before bidding was opened to other entities) on  hydrocarbon resources that could be
developed  quickly. Pemex retained rights to explore and develop 83% of Mexico's proved  and probable reserves and 21% of its prospective resources, as well as the  option to migrate these <em>entitlements</em> to other contract structures [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#41">41</a>].</p>
 <p>Bidding was opened to other  entities in Round One, which began with an auction of shallow-water exploration  blocks in July 2015 (Phase One). In response to industry feedback on the terms of  the first auction, CNH made changes for the second auction in September 2015 (Phase  Two, shallow-water production blocks) that resulted in considerably more  industry interest. To participate in the first two phases, companies and  consortia were required to meet technical and financial criteria and thresholds.  (The different phases of a single bid round also are referred to as <em>tenders</em>.) The criteria included minimum  previous or current E&amp;P experience (barrels produced, capital investments  in E&amp;P activities, and, in the case of a consortium operator, a net worth  of at least $1 billion). Participating entities bid on two criteria: government  share of operating profit, and incremental investment over the minimum work program  commitment. The government&rsquo;s weighting ratio served to balance its two  objectives: maximizing state revenues in the short term, and at the same time ensuring  the long-term development of a healthy Mexican E&amp;P sector [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#42">42</a>].</p>
<p>In December 2015, the third phase of Round One  awarded rights to produce from onshore fields. Because it was intended to  attract more participation by Mexican firms, CNH relaxed expertise criteria for  companies to qualify as operators. It began allowing  companies without previous E&amp;P experience to qualify by showing evidence  that members of their staff have prior experience with E&amp;P projects [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#43">43</a>].</p>
<p>The fourth phase of Round  One will include deepwater blocks in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). With massive  petroleum resources and proximity to existing infrastructure on the U.S. side  of the GOM, this phase is attracting the most attention from international oil  companies (IOCs). However, deepwater projects have long lead times and are  technically challenging. Recognizing that the risks are more acute in a low  price environment, CNH is adjusting the structure of contract terms to attract  the most interest from IOCs. Contract blocks are being reshuffled and  consolidated in response to complaints that offerings were too small.</p>
<p>The fifth phase, which may  be postponed to a future bid round, will focus on the Chicontopec Basin and  other tight oil resources. In a low oil price environment, however, there is  less incentive to undertake new E&amp;P ventures, especially challenging ones  such as deepwater or tight oil.</p>
<p>Throughout the process,  Mexico&rsquo;s energy agencies&#8212;CNH and the energy ministry, Secretar&iacute;a de EnergÃ­a (SENER)&#8212;have  sought input and feedback and have incorporated the feedback into the terms for  subsequent phases. For example, in response to industry feedback from a  relatively unsuccessful first phase, contract terms were amended to be more in  line with international standards [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#44">44</a>].</p>
<p>EIA expects that CNH and the other agencies  involved in the process will continue to learn from experience, adapt, and improve  to garner increased interest and revenue in later phases. The process continues  to be dynamic, although it is directed toward achieving Mexico&rsquo;s stated main  objective of maximizing revenue to the state by increasing production in the  next several years.</p>

<h4>Other liquids supply</h4>
<p>Other liquid fuels&#8212;including NGPL, biofuels, CTL, GTL,  kerogen (oil shale), and refinery gain&mdash;currently supply a relatively small  portion of total world petroleum and other liquid fuels, accounting for about  16% of the total in 2012. Other liquid fuels are projected to grow modestly in  importance in the IEO2016 Reference case, as the other liquids share of the  world&rsquo;s total liquids supply increases to 18% in 2040 (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-10.PNG">see Figure 2-10</a>).</p>
<p>NGPL is the largest component of other liquids,  accounting for 67% of the total in 2012 (Figure 2-15). The increase in NGPL  production in IEO2016 is directly related to the increase in natural gas  production, of which NGPL is often a coproduct. In contrast, increased  production of other liquids (primarily biofuels, CTL, and GTL) occurs in  response to high prices that support expansion of their production with  available domestic resources, such as crops, coal, or gas. In the IEO2016  Reference case, sustained low oil prices in the early years of the projection  make the development of the non-NGPL other liquids less economically  attractive. In addition to being price-sensitive, biofuels development also  relies heavily on policies or mandates to support growth. </p>

         <h4>New biofuels from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids</h4>
         <p>A  new type of renewable diesel fuel is produced in response to biofuel mandates  and customer demand for higher quality. Unlike other biofuels, hydroprocessed  esters and fatty acids (HEFA) are nearly indistinguishable from their petroleum  counterparts [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#45">45</a>].  Worldwide, more than a billion gallons of HEFA fuels were produced in 2014  (Figure 2-16). </p>
         <p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-16.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-16.png" alt="Figure 2-16. World production of renewable diesel fuels from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, 2011â€“14" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure2-16_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
         <p>HEFA  fuels are hydrocarbons rather than alcohols or esters. During the refining  process, oxygen is removed from the esters and fatty acids that make up  vegetable oil, leaving only hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons from nonpetroleum  sources are known as <em>drop-in</em> fuels,  because they are nearly identical to comparable petroleum-based fuels. HEFA  fuels, which are the most common drop-in biofuels, can be used in diesel  engines without blending with petroleum diesel fuel.</p>
         <p>Currently, HEFA fuels are  approved by ASTM International for use in jet engines, at blend rates up to 50%  with petroleum jet fuel [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#46">46</a>].</p>
<p>To date, the HEFA biofuel  most commonly produced has been a diesel replacement fuel that is marketed abroad  as <em>hydrotreated vegetable oil</em> (HVO) and  in the United States as <em>renewable diesel</em>.  HEFA fuels are produced by reacting vegetable oil or animal fat with hydrogen  in the presence of a catalyst. The equipment and process are very similar to  the hydrotreaters used to reduce diesel sulfur levels in petroleum refineries.  There are currently 10 plants worldwide that produce renewable diesel, one of  which is ENI&rsquo;s former petroleum refinery in Venice, Italy [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#47">47</a>].  Total is planning to convert its La Mede, France, refinery to HVO production [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#48">48</a>],  and four additional renewable diesel projects are being developed by other  producers. Finnish Neste is the world&rsquo;s largest producer of renewable diesel.  Other major producers are Italy&rsquo;s ENI, U.S.-based Diamond Green Diesel, and  Swedish refiner Preem.</p>
<p>Beyond diesel, another outlet for HEFA fuels  using similar technology is biojet fuel, which can be blended with petroleum  jet fuel in proportions up to 50%. As with any alternative jet fuel, HEFA  biojet fuel is required to meet stringent specifications to ensure its performance  under a wide range of conditions. One potential consumer of HEFA bioject fuel  is the U.S. Department of Defense, which intends to use biojet fuel in its JP-8  jet fuel. JP-8 is a versatile fuel used in military vehicles, stationary diesel  engines, and jet aircraft [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#49">49</a>].  This use of a common fuel simplifies logistics. There is also civilian interest  in nonpetroleum jet fuel: Alaska Airlines, KLM, and United Airlines have  demonstrated the use of HEFA biojet fuel on commercial flights since 2011.</p>

       <h4>Low Oil Price case</h4>
       <p>Across the three IEO2016 price cases, OPEC's crude and lease  condensate production falls as oil prices rise from the Low Oil Price case to  the High Oil Price case. Alternatively, non-OPEC production of both petroleum  and other liquid fuels increases as oil prices increase from the Low Oil Price  case to the High Oil Price case.</p>
<p>In the IEO2016 Low Oil Price case, crude oil  prices are $76/b in 2040. GDP growth in the non-OECD countries averages 3.9%/year  from 2012 to 2040, compared with 4.2%/year in the IEO2016 Reference case. The  combination of lower economic activity and lower prices results in non-OECD  liquid fuel consumption in 2040 that is very close to that in the IEO2016  Reference case (Figure 2-17). Even in a scenario where low economic growth  translates to lower energy demand (non-OECD energy demand in 2040 is 26  quadrillion Btu lower than in the IEO2016 Reference case), the lower prices  encourage consumers to use cheap liquid fuels rather than other forms of  energy. In contrast, economic growth in the OECD regions is essentially the  same in the Low Oil Price case as in the IEO2016 Reference case. Total OECD  energy consumption in 2040 is about the same as in the IEO2016 Reference case,  but lower prices encourage consumers to use more liquid fuels compared to other  energy sources. As a result, in 2040 OECD nations consume 48 million b/d of oil  in the Low Oil Price case, compared with 46 million b/d in the IEO2016 Reference  case.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-17.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-17.png" alt="Figure 2-17. World petroleum liquid fuels consumption in three cases, 2012 and 2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure2-17_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>On  the supply side, OPEC&rsquo;s market share of world crude and lease condensate  production ranges between 42% and 45% through 2020, then rises to 53% in 2040,  as its production increases from 33 million b/d in 2012 to 54 million b/d in  2040, and its share of total world liquid fuels production in 2040 is 44%. In  contrast, because North Sea Brent prices are lower than in the IEO2016 Reference  case, non-OPEC crude and lease condensate production increases by only about 6  million b/d, to 48 million b/d in 2040, or 5 million b/d lower than in the IEO2016  Reference case. With higher average costs for resource development in the  non-OPEC countries, the North Sea Brent crude oil price in the Low Oil Price  case is not sufficient to make many undeveloped fields economically viable.  Production of other liquid fuels, which typically are more expensive to produce,  also grows more slowly than in the IEO2016 Reference case. In the Low Oil Price  case, total production of other liquid fuels increases from 14 million b/d in  2012 to 20 million b/d in 2040, or 1.5 million b/d lower than in the IEO2016 Reference  case (Figure 2-18).</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-18.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_2-18.png" alt="Figure 2-18. World petroleum and other liquid fuels production in three cases, 2012 and 2040 " width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure2-18_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>

       <h4>High Oil Price case</h4>
       <p>World  oil prices in the High Oil Price reach $149/b in 2020 and $252/b in 2040, and higher  assumed costs for crude and lease condensate production result in lower  production than in the IEO2016 Reference case. Lower crude and lease condensate supply results in higher prices, which  incentivize increased development of liquid supplies from price-sensitive  emerging sources, including tight oil, bitumen, and other liquid fuels, which  have higher production costs.</p>
<p>GDP growth in the non-OECD countries averages 4.5%/year from  2012 to 2040 in the High Oil Price case, as compared with 4.2%/year in the  IEO2016 Reference case. The combination of high economic activity and high  prices results in non-OECD liquids consumption that is about the same as in the  IEO2016 Reference case (see Figure 2-17). Although the higher level of economic  activity increases non-OECD demand for total energy (total non-OECD energy  consumption in 2040 is about 27 quadrillion Btu higher in the High Oil Price  case than in the IEO2016 Reference case), the higher costs associated with  liquid fuels encourages consumers to use other energy sources. On the other  hand, the greater economic activity boosts incomes, making fuels more  affordable for consumers.</p>
<p>OECD economic growth in the High Oil Price case is unchanged  from the IEO2016 Reference case, and total energy demand is similar in the two  cases. Higher oil prices in combination with the same IEO2016 Reference case economic  activity mean that OECD consumers implement improved efficiency and  conservation measures and switch to less expensive fuels where possible. In  2040, the OECD region as a whole consumes 44 million b/d in the High Oil Price  case, or 2.0 million b/d less than in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>
<p>On the supply side, liquid fuels production in the OPEC  countries is lower in the High Oil Price case than in the IEO2016 Reference  case, and their market share of total petroleum and other liquid fuels  production declines to between 34% and 39%. Non-OPEC crude and lease condensate  production increases initially in the High Oil Price case at about the same  rate as in the IEO2016 Reference case. In the medium term, access to resources  is lower than in the Reference case and non-OPEC production is not able to grow  beyond Reference case levels, despite the higher prices. In the long term,  however, high world oil prices induce more non-OPEC supply into the market. In  the High Oil Price case, non-OPEC crude and lease condensate production  increases to 58 million b/d in 2040, or 5 million b/d higher than in the IEO2016  Reference case (see Figure 2-18).</p>
<p>Liquid fuels production in the OPEC countries is lower in  the High Oil Price case than in the IEO2016 Reference case, and their share of  total petroleum and other liquid fuels production declines over the projection.  As a result, the OPEC market share of world petroleum and other liquids  production in the High Oil Price case never exceeds the peak of 42% that it  reached in 2008 and eventually declines to 34% in 2040. OPEC petroleum and  other liquids production increases by only 3 million b/d, from 37 million b/d in  2012 to 40 million b/d in 2040 (as compared with an increase of nearly 15  million b/d in the IEO2016 Reference case).</p>
<p>The economics of other liquid fuels also benefit from higher  prices in the High Oil Price case. Non-OPEC production of other liquid fuels  increases to 20 million b/d in 2040, nearly 5 million b/d higher than in the IEO2016  Reference case; and Non-OPEC production of NGPL grows to 10 million b/d in  2040, 2 million b/d higher than in the IEO2016 Reference case. Higher oil  prices also lead to significant increases in non-OPEC production of biofuels,  CTL, and GTL as compared with the IEO2016 Reference case. In 2040, non-OPEC  other liquids supplies (excluding NGPL) are 2 million b/d higher in the High  Oil Price case than in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>
       <h4>Reserves</h4>
<p>Proved reserves of crude oil are the estimated  quantities that geological and engineering data indicate can be recovered in  future years from known reservoirs, assuming existing technology and current  economic and operating conditions. Most increases in proved reserves since 2000  have come from revisions to reserves in discovered fields, rather than new discoveries  [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#50">50</a>].  As of December 2015, proved world oil reserves, as reported by the <em>Oil &amp; Gas Journal</em>, were estimated at  1,656 billion barrels&#8212;2 billion barrels higher than the estimate at the end of  2014 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#51">51</a>].  According to the <em>Oil &amp; Gas Journal</em>,  around half of the world&rsquo;s proved oil reserves are located in the Middle East,  and more than 80% of the world&rsquo;s proved reserves are concentrated in eight  countries [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#52">52</a>],  of which only Canada (with oil sands included) and Russia are not members of  OPEC. In 2013, the largest increase in proved reserves by far was attributed to  Venezuela, as the country now reports its Orinoco belt extra-heavy oil in its  totals [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#53">53</a>].  As a result, Venezuela&rsquo;s reserves alone increased by 86 billion barrels from  2012 to 2013. Russia also reported a significant gain in 2013, at 20 billion  barrels. Country-level estimates of proved reserves from the <em>Oil &amp; Gas Journal</em> are developed from  data reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), from  foreign government reports, and from international geologic assessments. The  estimates are not always updated annually.    
<p>In some cases in the IEO2016 projections, country-level  volumes for cumulative production through 2040 exceed the estimates of proved  reserves. This does not imply that resources and the physical limits of  production have not been considered in the development of production forecasts,  or that the projections assume a rapid decline in production immediately after  the end of the projection period as reserves are depleted. EIA considers  resource availability in all long-term country-level projections, the  aggregation of which gives the total world production projection. However,  proved reserves are not an appropriate measure for judging total resource  availability in the long run. For example, despite continued production, global  reserves historically have not declined, because new reserves have been added  through exploration, discovery, and reserve replacement.</p>
<p>Proved reserves are only a subset of the entire potential  oil resource base. Resource base estimates include estimated quantities of both  discovered and undiscovered liquids that have the potential to be classified as  reserves at some time in the future. The resource base may include oil that  currently is not technically recoverable but could become recoverable in the  future as technologies advance. In the IEO2016 Reference case, the resource  base does not pose a global constraint on oil supply.</p>
<p>To construct plausible projections for petroleum liquids  production, underlying analysis must consider both production beyond the end of  the projection period and the physical realities and limitations of production.  Proved reserves cannot provide an accurate assessment of the physical limits on  future production but rather are intended to provide insight as to company-level  or country-level development plans in the near term. Because of the  particularly rigid requirements for the classification of resources as proved  reserves, even the cumulative production levels from individual development  projects may exceed initial estimates of proved reserves.</p>
<p>EIA attempts to address the lack of  applicability of proved reserves estimates to long-term production projections  by developing a production methodology based on the true physical limits of production,  initially-in-place volumes, and technologically limited recovery factors. By  basing long-term production assessments on resources rather than reserves, EIA  is able to present projections that are physically achievable and can be  supported beyond the 2040 projection horizon.
