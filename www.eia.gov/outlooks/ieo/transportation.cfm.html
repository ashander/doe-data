        <h1>Chapter 8. Transportation sector energy consumption</h1>
        <div align="right"><a class="ico_pdf" href="pdf/transportation.pdf"> print version</a></div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In the <em>International  Energy Outlook 2016</em> (IEO2016) Reference case, transportation sector delivered  energy consumption increases at an annual average rate of 1.4%, from 104  quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2012 to 155 quadrillion Btu in 2040.  Transportation energy demand growth occurs almost entirely in regions outside  of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (non-OECD), with  transportation demand roughly flat in OECD regions&#8212;largely reflecting different  expectations for economic growth in developing regions compared with developed  regions.</p>
        <p>In 2012, OECD nations accounted for 55% of the world&rsquo;s total  transportation energy consumption, and the non-OECD nations accounted for 45% (Figure  8-1). In 2020, the OECD and non-OECD shares of world transportation energy use  are projected to be equal. Non-OECD demand for transportation fuels continues  to outpace OECD demand, and in 2040 the non-OECD regions are expected to account  for 61% of global transportation energy consumption. In the non-OECD regions,  where 80% of the world&rsquo;s population resides, transportation energy demand nearly  doubles, from 47 quadrillion Btu in 2012 to 94 quadrillion Btu in 2040, with an  average annual increase of 2.5%. In several of the non-OECD regions, energy  consumption in light duty vehicles accounts for the bulk of the increase in  total transportation energy consumption, as economic growth raises standards of  living and, in turn, the demand for personal transportation.</p>

<h2>Transportation sector energy consumption by fuel</h2>
<p>Worldwide, petroleum and other liquid fuels [<a href="footnotesw.cfm.html#326">326</a>]  are the dominant source of transportation energy, although their share of total  transportation energy declines over the IEO2016 projection period, from 96% in  2012 to 88% in 2040. World transportation sector liquid fuels consumption grows  by 36 quadrillion Btu in the Reference case projection, with diesel (including  biodiesel) showing the largest gain (13 quadrillion Btu), jet fuel consumption  increasing by 10 quadrillion Btu, and motor gasoline (including ethanol blends)  increasing by 9 quadrillion Btu (Figure 8-2). Motor gasoline remains the  largest transportation fuel, but its share of total transportation energy  consumption declines from
39%  in 2012 to 33% in 2040. From 2012 to 2040 the total transportation market share  of diesel fuel (including biodiesel), which is the second-largest  transportation fuel, declines from 36% to 33% and the jet fuel share increases  from 12% to 14% in 2040.</p>

  <br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-2_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>The share of natural gas as a transportation fuel grows from  3% in 2012 to 11% in 2040. In 2012, pipelines accounted for 66% of  transportation sector natural gas use, light-duty vehicles 28%, and buses 4%.  As a result of favorable fuel economics, an increasing share of natural gas is  used for transportation modes of travel other than pipelines. A strong increase  is projected for the natural gas share of total energy use by large trucks in  the Reference case, from 1% in 2012 to 15% in 2040. In addition, 50% of bus  energy consumption is projected to be natural gas in 2040, as well as 17% of  freight rail, 7% of light-duty vehicles, and 6% of domestic marine vessels.</p>
<p>Electricity remains a minor fuel for the world&rsquo;s  transportation energy use, although its importance in passenger rail  transportation remains high: in 2040, electricity will account for 40% of total  passenger rail energy consumption. The electricity share of total light-duty  vehicle energy consumption grows to 1% in 2040 in the Reference case, as  increasing sales of new plug-in electric vehicles penetrate the total  light-duty stock.</p>
<h2>OECD transportation sector energy consumption</h2>
<p>The OECD as a whole does not contribute to the  worldwide growth in transportation fuels consumption in the IEO2016 Reference  case. OECD transportation energy consumption patterns are already well  established with slow economic and population growth rates and vehicle  efficiency improvements, transportation energy use for the region as a whole does  not increase over the 2012&#8211;40 projection period (<a href="motor.html"><em>see &quot;Motor vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards by country,&quot;</em></a>). Almost no increase in transportation energy consumption is  projected for the nations in the OECD Americas, as continued fuel economy  improvements offset growth in vehicle miles traveled. In Japan, an aging and declining  population results in lower transportation energy use, dropping by an average  of 0.7%/year, with Japan&rsquo;s transportation energy consumption falling from 3.9  quadrillion Btu in 2012 to 3.3 quadrillion Btu in 2040. Most of the decline in  Japan&rsquo;s transportation fuel use is for light-duty vehicles, with smaller  decreases projected for freight trucks. The largest growth in OECD transportation  energy use is projected for the Mexico/Chile region. In combination, delivered  transportation energy use increases by 1.2%/year from 2012 to 2040 (Figure 8-3)  compared to 0.2%/year for the OECD as a whole.</p>

        <div class="tie_correction">
          <h4>Motor  vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards by country</h4>
          <p>Nine countries and regions,  which together account for 75% of global fuel consumption by light-duty  vehicles, have adopted mandatory or voluntary standards for increasing fuel  economy and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The intent and structure  of the policies vary widely around the world. Because fuel economy and GHG  emissions policies have large effects on fuel consumption, vehicle standards  are among the most important components of future demand for liquid fuels.</p>
<p>One area of difference is  the metric specified in the standard. Some standards focus on reducing GHG or  carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, some focus on improving fuel economy (or  reducing fuel consumption), and others focus on combinations of the two  objectives. The European Union (EU) and India have standards that specifically aim  to reduce CO2 emissions. Canada&rsquo;s standard includes restrictions on all GHG  emissions. Brazil and Japan have standards that aim to increase fuel economy,  requiring light-duty vehicles to achieve specific miles-per-gallon ratings. China&rsquo;s  standard requires light-duty vehicles to reduce fuel consumption per mile  traveled. The United States and Mexico have both fuel economy and GHG  standards, and manufacturers must satisfy both. South Korea&rsquo;s light-duty  vehicle manufacturers can choose to meet either a fuel economy or a GHG emissions  standard. In practice, however, the different metrics are related: improvements  in fuel economy reduce CO2 emissions, and CO2 emissions are a subset of GHG  emissions.</p>
<p>In addition, there are structural differences  among the various vehicle standards. The United States, Canada, and Mexico have  footprint-based corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, which set GHG  emissions targets (in Canada) or GHG emissions and fuel economy targets (in the  United States and Mexico) based on vehicle footprint, calculated as wheelbase  multiplied by average track width. The overall target for a specific  manufacturer is determined by averaging the targets for the footprints of all  the vehicles the manufacturer produces. Brazil, the EU, India, and South Korea  have weight-based corporate average standards, which are similar to  footprint-based standards but based on vehicle weight. China has a combination  standard based on both vehicle weight class and corporate average fuel economy,  which is more stringent than the weight-based corporate average standard alone;  light-duty vehicle manufacturers in China must meet fuel consumption standards for  each weight class, as well as an overall corporate average fuel consumption  standard. Japan has a corporate average standard based on weight class, which  requires each light-duty vehicle to meet the standard for its weight class  rather than an overall standard for the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Fuel  economy and emissions standards typically are applied to the vehicles that a  company sells in a given country, rather than to all the vehicles it produces  in a given country. For instance, U.S.-manufactured vehicles sold in Europe are  required to meet European standards, and those sold in Japan are required to  meet Japanese standards. As more countries adopt light-duty vehicle standards,  differences among them are likely to persist because of variations in policy  goals and consumer preferences across countries. Still, given the global nature  of light-duty vehicle manufacturing, fuel economy is likely to increase for all  new vehicles, and GHG emissions per mile traveled are likely to decrease.</p></div>

        <h2>Non-OECD transportation sector energy consumption</h2>
        <p>Virtually all (94%) of the projected growth in world transportation  energy use occurs in the developing non-OECD economies, where strong economic  growth leads to rising standards of living that translate to demand for  personal travel and freight transport to meet growing consumer demand for goods  in non-OECD nations.</p>
        <h2>Non-OECD Asia</h2>
<p>Much of the growth in non-OECD (and world)  transportation energy use occurs in the emerging economies of non-OECD Asia. In  particular, China accounts for the world&rsquo;s largest regional increment in  transportation energy use, adding 14.3 quadrillion Btu of consumption over the  2012&#8211;40 projection period. China's consumption of transportation fuels  increases on average by 2.7%/year from 2012 to 2040 (Figure 8-4), led by  increases of 3.0%/year for heavy-duty vehicles that amount to 34% of the  country&rsquo;s total increase in transportation sector energy consumption. Although  energy consumption by light-duty vehicles increases by a more robust 3.5%/year,  they account for only 27% of China&rsquo;s total increase in transportation fuel use.</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-4.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-4.png" alt="Figure 8-4. Average annual growth in delivered transportation energy consumption by non-OECD region, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-4_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Total transportation energy consumption in India also shows  substantial growth in the IEO2016 Reference case, from 3.3 quadrillion Btu in  2012 to 10.9 quadrillion Btu in 2040, for an average annual increase of 4.4%.  Fuel consumption by India&rsquo;s light-duty vehicles grows by 7.7%/year, accounting  for 51% of the total increase in transportation energy use, largely as the result  of a sizable increase in the country&rsquo;s middle class. Energy use by heavy-duty  vehicles increases by an average of 4.4%/year from 2012 to 2040 and accounts  for 18% of the total increase in India&rsquo;s transportation energy use.</p>
<p>  Like India and China, the other economies of non-OECD Asia  also show significant growth in transportation energy demand from 2012 to 2040 in  the IEO2016 Reference case. Total transportation energy consumption among the  other non-OECD Asia nations grows from 7.6 quadrillion Btu in 2012 to 17.0  quadrillion Btu by 2040 in the Reference case, averaging 2.9%/year, with light-duty  vehicle energy consumption rising by an average of 3.9%/year and accounting for  51% of the total increase in transportation energy consumption among the  non-OECD Asian nations other than China and India. Significant increases in  transportation energy use in these other non-OECD Asia nations are also  projected for airline travel (17% of the total increase) and for heavy-duty  trucks (7%).</p>
<h2>Other non-OECD</h2>
<p>Although the largest expansion in non-OECD transportation  energy use occurs in non-OECD Asia, substantial increases are also projected  for Africa, the Middle East, and the non-OECD Americas. In Africa, for  instance, transportation energy consumption increases from 4.3 quadrillion Btu  in 2012 to 10.1 quadrillion Btu by 2040, averaging 3.1%/year. On a regional  basis, Africa has the world&rsquo;s highest projected growth in population (2.1%/year  from 2012 to 2040) and robust projected growth in income (GDP rises by  4.8%/year). These demographic trends, combined with an underdeveloped  transportation sector, explain the strong increase in transportation energy  demand in the IEO2016 Reference case. The consumption of light-duty vehicle  fuels increases by 3.9%/year in Africa, accounting for 52% of total  transportation energy use in the region, as a result of a substantial increase  in the number of middle-class consumers. Energy consumed by heavy-duty trucks  increases by an average of 2.5%/year and accounts for 5% of Africa's total increase  in transportation energy consumption.</p>
  <p>In the non-OECD Americas, growth in transportation energy  use is slower than in the non-OECD as a whole. In particular, transportation  energy consumption in Brazil&#8212;the largest economy in the non-OECD Americas&#8212;increases  by an average of 1.7%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared to the 2.5%/year increases  projected for the non-OECD region as a whole. Fuel consumption in light-duty  vehicles and heavy-duty trucks grows by similar rates in Brazil, with  light-duty vehicles accounting for 31% of the total increase and heavy-duty  trucks for 14%.</p>
<h2>Transportation sector energy consumption by mode</h2>
<p>The transportation sector comprises both passenger and  freight modes. The passenger modes include light-duty cars and trucks, buses,  2- and 3-wheel vehicles, airplanes, and passenger trains. The freight modes,  which are used in the movement of raw, intermediate, and finished goods to  consumers, include trucks (heavy-, medium-, and light-duty), marine vessels (international  and domestic), rail, and pipelines.</p>
  <p>Passenger or personal mobility-related fuel consumption  accounted for 61% of total world transportation energy consumption in 2012.  Among the personal mobility modes of transport, light-duty vehicles accounted  for 44% of total world transportation energy use, followed by aircraft at 11%.  Buses, 2- and 3-wheel vehicles, and rail accounted for 6% of total world  transportation energy use. Freight modes accounted for the other 39% of total  world transportation energy consumption. Freight trucks made up by far the  largest share (23%) of total transportation energy use, followed by marine  vessels (12%) and rail and pipelines (a combined 4%).</p>
<p>Worldwide, projected energy consumption for all  transportation modes grows from 2012 to 2040. For passenger travel modes, total  energy consumption rises by an average of 1.4%/year, from 63 quadrillion Btu in  2012 to 94 quadrillion Btu in 2040 (Figure 8-5). Light-duty vehicles show the  largest absolute increase (15 quadrillion Btu) from 2012 to 2040 among the  passenger modes of travel but the slowest growth (1.0%/year) among all the  transport modes. World energy demand  for aircraft increases by a total of 10 quadrillion Btu from 2012 to 2040,  while the combined energy demand for buses, 2- and 3-wheel vehicles, and rail  grows by 6 quadrillion Btu.</p>
<p>
<span><a href="images/figure_8-5.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-5.png" alt="Figure 8-5. World transportation sector delivered energy consumption by passenger modes, 2012 and 2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-5_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        <p>Total  freight-related energy consumption grows by an annual average of 1.5% in the  IEO2016 Reference case, from 40 quadrillion Btu in 2012 to 60 quadrillion Btu in  2040 (Figure 8-6)&#8212;slightly faster than the passenger modes. Energy consumption  for freight trucks increases by a total of 13 quadrillion Btu from 2012 to 2040,  followed by marine vessels at 6 quadrillion Btu and rail and pipelines combined  at about 2 quadrillion Btu. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently  proposed a significant increase in fuel economy standards for heavy trucks.  Should these proposed standards be adopted as final rules, they could  significantly lower projections for diesel use in trucking. To the extent that  these standards are implemented and affect trucks sold throughout the world,  the reduction in diesel fuel use in trucking could be greatly magnified.</p>

        <p><span><a href="images/figure_8-6.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-6.png" alt="Figure 8-6. World transportation sector delivered energy consumption by freight modes, 2012 and 2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
          <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-6_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span>
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>The  growth trends for energy consumed by passenger modes in OECD and non-OECD  regions from 2012 to 2040 differ considerably in the IEO2016 Reference case (Figure  8-7), with the OECD total declining by 1 quadrillion Btu and the non-OECD total  increasing by 31 quadrillion Btu. The difference is explained in part by the  larger increase in non-OECD passenger travel per capita from a low average base  relative to most OECD nations. Non-OECD income (as measured by GDP) grows at a  faster rate than in the OECD economies, and non-OECD consumers use more  personal transportation as per-capita incomes grow. Although incomes also rise  in the OECD nations, OECD levels of personal mobility are already relatively  high, and transportation patterns and infrastructure are well established. In  addition, the effects of increases in personal travel on OECD transportation  energy consumption are tempered by rising energy efficiency, resulting in no  growth in transportation energy consumption (<a href="images/figure_2-18.png">see Figure 8-1</a>). Although energy  efficiency improvements also occur in the non-OECD regions, their impacts are  overwhelmed by the increases in personal incomes and travel demand.</p>
        
        <p><span><a href="images/figure_8-7.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-7.png" alt="Figure 8-7. Change in OECD and non-OECD delivered transportation energy consumption by passenger mode, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-7_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
         <div class="tie_correction">
           <h4>World  transportation energy use for passenger travel</h4>
<p>The transportation of people and goods accounts  for about 25% of total world delivered energy consumption (Figure 8-8).  Passenger transportation&#8212;in particular, light-duty vehicles&#8212;accounts for most  transportation energy consumption, with light-duty vehicles consuming more energy  than all modes of freight transportation, including heavy trucks, marine, and  rail combined.</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-8.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-8.png" alt="Figure 8-8. World transportation energy consumption by mode, 2012" width="322" /></a><br />
    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-8_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
    
    <p>The  United States, where on-road passenger travel is especially prevalent, was the  world&rsquo;s largest transportation energy consumer in 2012, the most recent year for  which detailed international transportation data are available by mode. The  United States consumed 26 quadrillion Btu of transportation energy in 2012, or  13 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (b/d), representing 25% of global  transportation energy demand.</p>
<p>Major European countries (those in the OECD) and  China are also major transportation energy consumers, at 19 quadrillion Btu and  13 quadrillion Btu, respectively, in 2012. In contrast to both the United  States and OECD Europe, the largest share of China's on-road transportation  energy use is for freight movement rather than passenger travel. Together, the  United States, OECD Europe, and China account for 55% of world transportation  energy consumption (Figure 8-9).</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-9.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-9.png" alt="Figure 8-9. Transportation energy consumption by mode in selected countries and regions, 2012" width="322" /></a><br />
    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-9_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></span></span></p>
    
<p>On-road  use accounts for the largest share of transportation energy consumption in all  regions of the world, but there is considerable variation across regions in the  use of other modes of transportation. For instance, marine transport accounts  for one-fourth of South Korea's total transportation energy use, reflecting the  importance of marine transport in a peninsula nation whose economy relies heavily  on exports, with major trading partners reached by maritime travel. In  Australia, where regional air travel helps connect coastal population centers with  sparsely populated regions, interior air travel accounts for  nearly 20% of total transportation energy consumption, compared with 9% in the  United States and 6% in China.</p>
<p>Global transportation energy consumption is  dominated by two fuels: motor gasoline (including ethanol blends) and diesel  (including biodiesel blends). Together, these two fuels accounted for 75% of  total delivered transportation energy use in 2012. Motor gasoline is used  primarily for the movement of people, especially by light-duty vehicles. Diesel  fuel is used primarily for the movement of goods, especially by heavy-duty  trucks. Jet fuel accounts for 12% of the world&rsquo;s transportation energy  consumption, followed by residual fuel oil at 9%. Petroleum products account  for the largest share of transportation energy use by far, while nonpetroleum  fuels account for a small portion of the world energy mix, with natural gas and  electricity together accounting for about 4% of the world&rsquo;s total  transportation energy consumption.</p></div>
<p>By  mode, the largest increases in annual energy consumption for non-OECD passenger  travel from 2012 to 2040 in the Reference case are for light-duty vehicles (20  quadrillion Btu) and aircraft (6 quadrillion Btu). In contrast, OECD energy  demand for light-duty vehicles declines by 5 quadrillion Btu from 2012 to 2040,  and annual energy demand for aircraft grows by only 4 quadrillion Btu.</p>

<div class="tie_correction">
<h4>World stocks of passenger jet aircraft</h4>
<p>In 2013, three types of jet aircraft stock were available for national and international passenger travel: narrow-body, wide-body, and regional. Narrow-body jets are designed to carry between 120 and 180 passengers in two banks of seats separated by a center aisle; wide-body jets are designed for 200 to 500 passengers in three banks of seats; and regional jets are designed for 50 to 110 passengers. Nearly 28,000 passenger jets were in service in 2013, of which 55% were narrow-body, 19% were wide-body, and 26% were regional jets. By region, the United States had the largest stock of passenger jets (7,800), and OECD Europe had the second-largest (5,500). India and South Korea had the smallest numbers of passenger jets (499 and 209, respectively) (Figure 8-10).</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-10.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-10.png" alt="Figure 8-10. World passenger jet aircraft stocks by region and type, 2013" width="322" /></a><br />
    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-10_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></span></span></p>
    
<p>In  most regions, narrow-body aircraft used for regional and transcontinental trips  account for more than half of total aircraft fleets. In other regions&#8212;including  the Middle East, Japan, and South Korea&#8212;air travel is dominated by long  international flights, and wide-body aircraft account for approximately 45% of  the totals. In regions where short-range trips are more prevalent, regional  jets make up the largest shares of aircraft fleets, including 46% in  Australia/New Zealand and 51% in Canada.</p>
<p>Ratios of aircraft stock per million people also  differ by region. In general, the more developed OECD regions, with higher  gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, also have higher aircraft-to-population  ratios than the non-OECD regions (Figure 8-11). The Australia/New Zealand  region has the world's highest aircraft-to-population ratio (136 aircraft per  million people), Canada has the second-highest (127), and the United States has  the third-highest (50) despite its higher GDP per capita. In Japan (with GDP  per capita of $35,000), the ratio of aircraft per million population is  estimated at 37, while for Canada (with GDP per capita of $41,000), the ratio is  estimated at 127. Africa, India, and other non-OECD Asia have the lowest  aircraft-to-population ratios at 3, 2, and 2, respectively. These numbers  underscore the significant uncertainty associated with projecting future trajectories  of aircraft-to-population ratios in non-OECD countries as they develop  economically, which may reflect regional characteristics such as geography and  population despite having similar GDP per capita.</p>

</div>
<p>In  contrast to passenger modes of travel, the trends in freight modes in the OECD  and non-OECD regions are similar (Figure 8-12). In both, energy consumption  increases for all freight modes from 2012 to 2040, with the largest increases  for trucks and international maritime vessels. Production and consumption of  goods worldwide are an integral part of globalized supply chains, including  trade in intermediate products for global production processes, which in large  part is made possible by containerized transportation shipping and advances in information  technology.</p>

<h2>Transportation sector travel demand</h2>
<p>Rising global incomes increase the demand for  personal mobility, measured as passenger-miles per capita, in all the world  regions, with different rates of increase depending on current income levels (Figure  8-13) and travel patterns, as well as the unique nature of regional geographies.  Consequently, the rates of increase in travel demand per capita vary across the  OECD and non-OECD regions (Figure 8-14).</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-13.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-13.png" alt="Figure 8-13. GDP per capita in selected regions and countries, 2012&#8211;40 " width="322" /></a><br />

    <p><span><a href="images/figure_8-14.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-14.png" alt="Figure 8-14. Passenger travel per capita in selected regions and countries, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br />
    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-14_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
    
<p>OECD  regions are, for the most part, economically developed and thus have higher levels  of personal mobility than the non-OECD countries. In the IEO2016 Reference  case, OECD passenger travel per capita (including light-duty and 2- and 3-wheel  vehicles, buses, and passenger rail but excluding aircraft) increases from 9.1  thousand passenger-miles/person in 2012 to 10.3 thousand passenger-miles/person  in 2040, while average GDP per capita rises from about $36,000/person to  $56,500/person (in inflation-adjusted real 2010 U.S. dollars). In comparison, average  non-OECD GDP per capita rises from an average of $8,500/person in 2012 to  $20,800/person in 2040, and passenger travel per capita rises from 2.1 thousand  passenger-miles/person in 2012 to 4.9 thousand passenger-miles/person in 2040.</p>
<p>As a result of the increase of more than 100% in non-OECD  travel demand from 2012 to 2040, the region&rsquo;s total energy use for passenger  travel in 2040 is more than 50% higher than the OECD total, compared with about  two-thirds the OECD total in 2012. In 2012, non-OECD Asia (including China and  India) and Africa accounted for two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s total population; in  2040, they are projected to account for more than 70%. Accordingly, the two  regions have the largest projected growth in transportation energy consumption  in the IEO2016 Reference case. In China, delivered energy consumption in the transportation  sector increases by 2.7%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared with 0.2%/year for  the OECD as a whole. Per-capita income in China in 2040 is similar to the OECD level  in 2012, but China&rsquo;s transportation sector delivered energy consumption in  2040, at 18.9 million Btu/person, is less than half the OECD&rsquo;s 2012 average of  46.2 million Btu/person.</p>
<p>The transportation modes used for passenger  travel also reflect the effects of rising incomes and the current difference  between OECD and non-OECD personal mobility choices. In 2012, more than 80% of  OECD personal travel was by light-duty vehicle, compared with 41% of non-OECD  personal travel. In the non-OECD region, a substantial portion of personal  travel was by bus (35%), passenger rail (13%), and 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles  (11%). Non-OECD economic growth and rising incomes in the IEO2016 Reference  case lead to a higher overall rate of light-duty vehicle ownership (measured as  the number of light-duty vehicles per 1,000 people), but in 2040 the non-OECD  rate of light-duty vehicle ownership remains well below the OECD rate (Figure  8-15). Still, the light-duty vehicle share of non-OECD passenger travel rises  to more than 50% in 2040, primarily at the expense of buses and 2- and 3-wheeled  vehicles (Figure 8-16). Consequently the difference in light-duty vehicle  travel shares between the OECD and non-OECD regions is narrowed, but not  eliminated, by 2040 in the Reference case.</p>

<p>Demand  for personal travel by aircraft, measured as revenue passenger-miles, shows a  similar trend. As GDP and personal incomes increase, business and personal  airline travel also increase. Relatively wealthy OECD consumers already have a  much higher rate of airline travel per capita than do non-OECD consumers. Demand  for airline travel increases in the Reference case for both the OECD and  non-OECD regions, with more rapid growth among the non-OECD regions.</p>
<div class="tie_correction">
  <h4>Variations in air passenger travel by region and income level</h4>
<p>Air  passenger travel, measured by revenue passenger-miles (RPM) [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#327">327</a>],  includes both domestic travel (within a single IEO2016 region) and  international travel (across regional boundaries). In 2013, the United States led  the other world regions in total passenger air travel with 866 billion RPM,  followed by OECD Europe with 830 billion RPM and China with 392 billion RPM.  South Korea had the lowest passenger air travel, at 47 billion RPM (Figure 8-17).</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-17.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-17.png" alt="Figure 8-17. World air passenger travel by region, 2013" width="322" /></a><br />
    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-17_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
    
<p>In  2013, the United States had the world&rsquo;s highest level of domestic air passenger  travel and the second-highest level of international air passenger travel, at  603 billion RPM and 264 billion RPM, respectively. OECD Europe, with the  second-highest level of domestic air passenger travel, at 435 billion RPM, was first  in international travel with 395 billion RPM. China was third in domestic air  passenger travel, at 281 billion RPM, and other non-OECD Asia was third in  international air travel, at 170 billion RPM (Figure 8-18).</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-18.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-18.png" alt="Figure 8-18. World domestic and international air passenger travel by region, 2013" width="322" /></a><br />
    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-18_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
    
<p>As  gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increases in the world regions, RPM per  capita also increases. Regions with the highest GDP per capita (United States,  Australia/New Zealand, and Canada) also have the highest RPM per capita. In  2013, Australia led the world with 4,200 RPM per capita, followed by the United  States and Canada, both with 2,700 RPM per capita. Regions with lower GDP per  capita also have lower RPM per capita (Figure 8-19). India and Africa had the  lowest GDP per capita in 2013 ($5,000 and $4,300, respectively) and the lowest rates  of personal air travel (less than 100 RPM per capita).</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-19.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-19.png" alt="Figure 8-19. OECD and non-OECD gross domestic product per capita (thousand 2010 dollars) and air passenger travel per capita (revenue passenger-miles) by region, 2013" width="322" /></a><br />
    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-19_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
    
<p>In  general, regions with higher GDP per capita have higher RPM per capita. The regions  with the world&rsquo;s top five highest RPM per capita are comparatively wealthy OECD  regions&#8212;the United States, Australia and New Zealand, Canada, OECD Europe, and  Japan. Most of the non-OECD regions have RPM per capita below 500. In the  coming years, as strong economic growth in many non-OECD regions results in  higher GDP per capita, personal air travel also is expected to rise, as  suggested by the trends shown in Figure 8-19. As average GDP per capita in the non-OECD  regions approaches $40,000, travel behavior can be expected to vary&#8212;as it has  in the OECD regions&#8212;adding uncertainty as to whether future trends in RPM per  capita for the non-OECD regions will more closely resemble RPM per capita for Australia  or for the United States.</p>
</div>
<p>The  movement of freight (including trucks, rail, and domestic marine vessels),  measured in ton-miles [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#328">328</a>],  also shows the impact of economic growth. Freight travel demand is related  explicitly to economic activity, including the production and consumption of goods  in either intermediate or final form. Non-service industrial gross output [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#329">329</a>] per capita and GDP per capita can be used as proxies for production and  intermediate and personal consumption. As these two measures increase, the  number of freight ton-miles per capita increases. For example, in the IEO2016  Reference case, OECD nonservice industrial gross output per capita increases  from about $24,000/person in 2012 to $37,000/person in 2040 (Figure 8-20), and  ton-miles per capita increases from about 6.0 thousand ton-miles/person in 2012  to 9.0 thousand  ton-miles/person in 2040 (Figure 8-21). Similarly, non-OECD non-service  industrial output per capita grows from $10,000/person to $22,000/person, and  ton-miles per capita increases from about 2.0 thousand ton-miles in 2012 to 4.0  thousand ton-miles in 2040.</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_8-20.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_8-20.png" alt="Figure 8-20. OECD and non-OECD industrial gross output per capita, excluding service industries, 2012â€“40" width="322" /></a><br />

    <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure8-21_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
    
    <p>Another  source of freight energy consumption is international marine vessels. Worldwide  economic growth from the production and consumption of goods, as well as consumption  of energy commodities, leads directly to growth in worldwide volumes of maritime  freight movement. Approximately 80% of the world&rsquo;s merchandise trade by volume  is carried over water, with maritime trade in 2012 totaling nearly 60 trillion  ton-miles [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#330">330</a>].  Because of globalized supply chains, maritime shipments of nonenergy  commodities, such as manufactured goods, agricultural products, and minerals,  have grown much faster than global GDP and accounted for approximately 60% of total  maritime freight movement in in 2012. Significant amounts of energy commodities, such as crude oil from the Middle East and coal from Australia, also are transported internationally by cargo ships.</p>
