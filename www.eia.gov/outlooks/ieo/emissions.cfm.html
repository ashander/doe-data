        <div align="right"><a class="ico_pdf" href="pdf/emissions.pdf"> print version</a></div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Because  anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) result primarily from the  combustion of fossil fuels, energy consumption is at the center of the climate  change debate. In the<em> International  Energy Outlook 2016 </em>(IEO2016) Reference case, world energy-related CO2  emissions [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#331">331</a>]  increase from 32.3 billion metric tons in 2012 to 35.6 billion metric tons in  2020 and to 43.2 billion metric tons in 2040. The Reference case estimates do  not include effects of the recently finalized Clean Power Plan (CPP)  regulations in the United States, which reduce projected U.S. emissions in 2040  by 0.5 billion metric tons. Much of the growth in emissions is attributed to  developing nations outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD), many of which continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet the fast-paced  growth of energy demand. In the IEO2016 Reference case, non-OECD emissions in  2040 total 29.4 billion metric tons, or about 51% higher than the 2012 level.  In comparison, OECD emissions total 13.8 billion metric tons in 2040, or about  8% higher than the 2012 level (<a href="table9-1.cfm.html">Table 9-1</a> and Figure 9-1). </p>

        <span class="caption"><a href="../../forecasts/ieo/excel/figure9-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        <p>In  conjunction with the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris (COP21, November 30  through December 12, 2015), many countries have submitted emissions reduction  goals, or Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), under the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/chinaco2">/<em>see &quot;Policies to limit CO2 emissions in the  United States and China,&quot;</em></a>). EIA has tried to incorporate some of the specific  details, such as renewable energy goals, in the IEO2016 Reference case;  however, a great deal of uncertainty remains with regard to the implementation  of policies to meet stated goals. In addition, beyond energy-related CO2, other  gases (e.g., methane) and sources (e.g., deforestation) that contribute to  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but are not considered in IEO2016 could have  significant effects on national or regional shares of total global GHG  emissions and the achievement of INDCs. EIA's projections for CO2 emissions may  change significantly as laws and policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions are  implemented and enforced, or if existing laws are enhanced.</p>
        <div class="tie_correction">
          <h4><a name="chinaco2"></a>Policies to limit CO2 emissions in the United States and China</h4>
          <p>The United States and China are  the countries with the most energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Together  they accounted for about 40% of global CO2 emissions in 2012. In 2014, both  countries announced their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)  to the mitigation of their respective GHG emissions. It remains unclear,  however, whether either country will meet or exceed its announced target.  Further efforts to reduce GHG emissions were discussed at the Conference of the  Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (COP21), held in  Paris November 30 through December 12, 2015 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#332">332</a>].  EIA will continue to assess the targets resulting from COP21 for inclusion in  future analyses.</p>
<p>The United States, which in 2009 set a goal of  reducing GHG emissions by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020, has now announced an INDC  of 26% to 28% below its 2005 level by 2025. China's INDC states the objective  of peaking its CO2 emissions by about 2030 while making best efforts to achieve  an earlier peak. China's INDC also proposes a goal of 20% nonfossil energy use  in 2030. In addition, in September 2015, China announced its intent to expand  the country's seven current regional emissions trading programs in to a  national cap-and-trade program beginning in 2017, although specific emissions  caps and other policy details have not yet been announced. China surpassed the  United States as the world's
largest  CO2 emitter in 2008 (Figure 9-2). In 2012 its CO2 emissions per capita were  about one-third of the U.S. level, and its emissions per unit of economic  output were about 70% higher than the U.S. level.</p>
<p><span><a href="images/figure_9-2.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_9-2.png" alt="Figure 9-2. Carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in the United States and China, 1990&#8211;2012" width="322" /></a>
  <br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure9-2_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        
<p>In the  United States, about 80% of all CO2 emissions in 2012 were related to energy,  with the remainder attributed to sources such as cement production,  agricultural activities, land use changes, and forestry. Two of the largest  sources of U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions are the transportation sector and the  electric power sector. For transportation, the main mechanism to reduce  emissions is increasing the stringency of fuel economy and GHG emissions  standards for both light-duty vehicles and heavy trucks. For electric power,  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized a Clean Power Plan  (CPP) aimed at significantly reducing CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled  generators.</p>
<p>In China, the ultimate  achievement of emissions targets will depend on its need to balance  environmental goals with economic growth and development. In the past, China&rsquo;s  energy demand growth has been driven by development plans as part of the  government&rsquo;s five-year planning cycles that have centered mainly on industrial expansion.  China is still industrializing, and its energy needs will grow despite slowing  economic growth and a shift to less energy-intensive industries. China&rsquo;s energy  mix is dominated by coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and it is likely  to remain so for the foreseeable future. If its total CO2 emissions are to peak  near 2030, coal consumption will have to stop growing, and perhaps decline  substantially, between 2015 and 2035 unless carbon capture and storage (CCS)  technology, which is a relatively new technology, is rapidly adopted.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s growing middle class is expected to  increase its demand for energy services as income per capita increases, and its  sectoral shares of energy consumption are expected to continue shifting from  industry to the building and transportation sectors. In both sectors, the  energy efficiencies of China&rsquo;s technologies have improved in recent years, which  should help China curb the rate of growth in its energy use.</p>

        <h2>CO2 emissions by fuel</h2>
        <p>Energy-related  CO2 emissions from the use of liquid fuels, natural gas, and coal all increase  in the IEO2016 Reference case, with the relative contributions of the  individual fuels shifting over time (Figure 9-3). In 1990, CO2 emissions  associated with the consumption of liquid fuels accounted for the largest  portion (43%) of global emissions. In 2012, they  had fallen to 36% of total emissions, and they remain at that level through  2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case. Coal, which is the most carbon-intensive  fossil fuel, became the leading source of world energy-related CO2 emissions in  2006, and it remains the leading source through 2040 in the Reference case.  However, although coal accounted for 39% of total emissions in 1990 and 43% in  2012, its share is projected to decline to 38% in 2040, only slightly higher  than the liquid fuels share. The natural gas share of CO2 emissions, which was  relatively small at 19% of total GHG emissions in 1990 and 20% in 2012,  increases in the IEO2016 Reference case to 26% of total fossil fuel emissions  in 2040.</p>
        
        <p><span><a href="images/figure_9-3.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_9-3.png" alt="Figure 9-3. World energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by fuel type, 1990â€“2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure9-3_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Worldwide consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels  grows by about 177 quadrillion Btu from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference  case. In 2012, fossil fuels accounted for 84% of worldwide energy consumption. If  fossil fuels had kept the same share in the Reference case, they would have  increased from 461 quadrillion Btu in 2012 to 684 quadrillion Btu by 2040. However,  with the increase in renewable and nuclear energy, the share of fossil fuels in  total decreases to 78%, and the mix of those fossil fuels changes. The coal  share of total energy use falls from 28% in 2012 to 22% in 2040. Over the same  period, the liquids share falls from 33% to 30%, while the natural gas share rises  from 23% to 26%.</p>
<p>The net result of both the reduced share of  fossil-fuel energy and the shift in the fossil-fuel mix is that projected  energy-related CO2 emissions in 2040 are 10% lower in 2040 than they would have  been without the changes. Natural gas is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions  growth in both the OECD and non-OECD economies, accounting for 100% and 35%, respectively,  of the projected CO2 emissions increases in the two regions (Figure 9-4).</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_9-4.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_9-4.png" alt="Figure 9-4. OECD and non-OECD energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by fuel type, 1990&#8211;2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure9-4_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Growth in CO2 emissions from the consumption of liquids  worldwide is projected to average 1.0% annually in the IEO2016 Reference case, resulting  in an absolute increase of 3.8 billion metric tons of liquids-related CO2  emissions from 2012 to 2040. In the OECD countries, liquids-related CO2  emissions decline by an average of 0.1%/year. In the non-OECD countries, rising  demand for transportation and industrial uses of liquid fuels contributes to a  growth rate of 1.9%/year for total CO2 emissions from the combustion of liquid  fuels.</p>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, world  coal-related CO2 emissions show slower growth over the 28-year projection  period than in projections in past IEOs, averaging 0.6%/year and resulting in an  18% increase in coal-related emissions and a 14% increase if the U.S. CPP is  included. Coal-related emissions in the OECD and non-OECD regions increase by 0.1%  and 0.8%/year from 2012 to 2040, respectively. Under the U.S. CPP, OECD  coal-related CO2 emissions would decrease by 0.4%/year. The world&rsquo;s top three  national sources of coal-related emissions are China, India, and the United  States, which remain at the top throughout the projection period and in  combination account for 70% of world coal-related CO2 emissions in 2040.</p>
         <div class="tie_correction">
           <h4>Uncertainties in projecting European Union emissions reductions</h4>
<p>The European Union (EU) has  pledged a goal of a 40% reduction in total GHG emissions from 1990 levels by  2030 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#333">333</a>].  However, at this time only parts of the programs to implement the pledge are in  place, and for the IEO2016 Reference case EIA has not assumed anything beyond  what EU countries now have in place. Considering programs currently in place, OECD  Europe&rsquo;s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rise slightly through 2040;  however, Turkey and Norway (which are included in OECD Europe) are not part of  the EU [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#334">334</a>].</p>
<p>Much of the difference between the emissions  level projected in the Reference case and the EU goal would likely be covered  by emission allowance credits. The cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s efforts to reduce  GHG emissions is the EU Emissions Trading  System (ETS). The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system that covers approximately 45%  of the GHG emissions in the EU&rsquo;s 28 member states, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein,  and Norway. The ETS was introduced in 2005 in a first-phase trial period that  lasted through 2007. The second phase began in 2008 and ended in 2012. A large  surplus of allowances that were accumulated during the first two phases will be  available for use in the third phase, from 2013 to 2020 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#335">335</a>].The  ETS credit surplus is one of many uncertainties surrounding the prospects for  EU reductions. Other uncertainties include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Negotiations under way to reform the post-2020  ETS are expected to continue for another two years [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#336">336</a>].  Without a better understanding of the rules after 2020, it is difficult to  project emissions to 2040.</li>
  <li>With economic growth in the EU lower than  projected when the ETS was designed, there are substantial banked (unused) credits.  Also, covered industries continue to receive some free allowances. The surplus credits  are estimated to reach 2.6 billion metric tons in 2020 with nearly 2.0 billion metric  tons remaining in 2030 unless the post-2020 reforms are stringent and  enforceable [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#337">337</a>]. Further,  the current reduction factor of 1.74% (the rate at which the annual cap is reduced)  probably is inadequate to achieve the stated EU goals [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#338">338</a>].</li>
  <li>In terms of energy-related carbon dioxide  emissions, renewable electricity generation is the primary marginal source of noncarbon  energy. In the IEO2016 Reference case, OECD Europe&rsquo;s renewable energy goals are  evaluated on a country-by-country basis.</li>
  <li>Nuclear power, the largest existing source of noncarbon  energy, faces an uncertain future in OECD Europe. For example, France has been  phasing in renewables to replace nuclear capacity. In addition, several EU nations,  including Germany and Switzerland, have announced plans to phase out or shut  down their operating nuclear reactors in the aftermath of the March 2011  disaster at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</li>
  <li>On the energy-demand side, OECD Europe already  has achieved relatively low energy intensity, and the region&rsquo;s energy intensity  is projected to fall from 4.4 thousand Btu per dollar of GDP in 2012 (measured  in purchasing power parity terms) to 3.2 thousand Btu per dollar in 2040 in the  IEO2016 Reference case.</li>
  <li>The price of EU ETS credits has remained around  8 Euros over the past few years, well below the level of 40 to 50 Euros that  many analysts believe would be required to initiate a larger shift from fossil  fuels to noncarbon energy sources [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#339">339</a>].</li>

<li>Another important uncertainty is whether land  use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) will be included in the EU goal. As  of April 2016, specific rules for their inclusion had not been published [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#340">340</a>]  and LULUCF is not included in the  IEO2016 projections. However, the rules could greatly influence levels of  energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.</li></ul>
</div>
        <h2>CO2 emissions by region</h2>
<p>World energy-related CO2 emissions increase at  an average annual rate of 1.0% from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case  (<a href="table9-2.cfm.html">Table 9-2</a>). On average, OECD emissions increase by 0.3%/year and non-OECD  emissions increase by 1.5%/year. Among the OECD countries, energy-related CO2 emissions  from the combined region of Mexico and Chile grow by an average of 1.1%/year,  and emissions from South Korea increase by an average of 1.0%/year (Figure 9-5).  The two regions also have among the highest projected rates of economic growth  in the OECD over the period, with Mexico/Chile&rsquo;s GDP increasing by 3.1%/year in  the IEO2016 Reference case and South Korea&rsquo;s GDP increasing by 2.1%/year. For  all the other OECD countries and regions, CO2 emissions increase by an average  of less than 1%/year. Japan&rsquo;s CO2 emissions <em>decline</em> by an average of 0.4%/year from 2012 to 2040. In OECD Europe, CO2 emissions  increase by 0.2%/year; and in the OECD Americas, CO2 emissions increase by 0.3%/year  over the projection period, with the growth rate dropping to 0%/year after  implementation of the CPP. In 2040, OECD Europe accounts for about 10% of world  emissions, as compared with about 13% in 2012, and the OECD Americas region accounts  for 16% (or 15%, if the CPP is taken into account), down from 20% in 2012. For  the OECD region as a whole, GDP growth averages 2.0%/year.

  <h4>U.S. Clean Power Plan Rule</h4>
<p>In March 2015, the United  States submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) for GHG  emissions reduction to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change (UNFCCC). The U.S. INDC pledges an emissions reduction of 26% to 28%  below 2005 levels by 2025 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#341">341</a>].  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final version of  the U.S. Clean Power Plan rule (CPP) in August 2015 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#342">342</a>].  The effect of that rule was not included in the baseline for U.S. projections  in IEO2016 because of the timing of its release. However, estimates of the effect  based on the proposed rule have been included in this chapter.</p>
<p>The final CPP reflects  substantive changes from the proposed rule, but the overall expected level of  CO2 emissions reduction is similar to the level expected under the proposed  rule. To the extent that the requirements are similar, a reasonable indicator  of potential changes resulting from the final CPP is provided in EIA&rsquo;s analysis  of the proposed rule [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#343">343</a>].</p>
<p>In EIA&rsquo;s analysis, the key impact of the  proposed CPP rule was a projected reduction in U.S. coal-fired generation, by 560  billion kilowatthours (kWh) in 2030, to approximately 33% less than the projected  1,713 billion kWh without the CPP rule (Figure 9-6). Thus, under the proposed  rule, the projected reduction in output from U.S. coal-fired power plants would  yield CO2 emissions of roughly 613 million metric tons (25% below 2005 levels) in  2020 and roughly 830 million metric tons (34% below 2005 levels) in 2030.</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_9-6.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_9-6.png" alt="Figure 9-6. U.S. electricity generation by primary fuel in the AEO2015 Reference case, 1990â€“2040, and incremental energy savings in the AEO2015 Base Policy case, 1990&#8211;2040" width="322" /></a><br />
  <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure9-6_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></span></span></p>
    
<p>The Clean Power Plan leads  to a decrease in coal-fired generation, reflecting both additional coal plant  retirements and lower utilization rates for plants that remain in use. In the  early stages of implementation, natural gas-fired generation is the primary  replacement for coal, followed by a shift to renewables in the mid-2020s. The  actual mix of additional renewables and gas-fired generation resulting from the  Clean Power Plan will depend on CPP implementation decisions made by states,  the availability of tax credits for renewables&#8212;which were extended by  legislation enacted in December 2015, and fuel and technology costs.</p>
<p>Changes to the final CPP,  made by the EPA rule in response to comments, relate to the structure and  implementation of the CPP program rather than to its requirements. Significant  changes from the proposed rule to the final rule include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More gradual implementation over the compliance  period</li>
  <li>Increased emphasis on trading options, including  examples of rules for rate-based and mass-based programs to speed the creation  of interstate cooperative programs</li>
  <li>Reduced variability across states in the required  CO2 emissions reductions, with the EPA basing its emission rate standards on  CO2 averages determined at the electricity grid interconnection level rather  than at the state level.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Non-OECD  Asia accounts for about 59% of the growth in world CO2 emissions from 2012 to  2040. China&rsquo;s emissions grow by an average of only 1.0%/year (Figure 9-7), but they  still account for 41% of the total increase in non-OECD Asia&rsquo;s emissions.  India&rsquo;s CO2 emissions increase by 2.7%/year, and emissions in the rest of  non-OECD Asia increase by an average of 2.3%/year, accounting for 30% and 29%,  respectively, of the total non-OECD Asia increase in CO2 emissions. From 2012  to 2040, emissions from coal combustion in non-OECD Asia increase by 2.2  billion metric tons, and emissions from liquid fuels increase by 2.3 billion metric  tons, while emissions from natural gas combustion increase by 2.0 billion metric  tons (Figure 9-8).</p>

    <p>Among the non-OECD regions, the slowest growth in CO2  emissions, at 0.3%/year, is projected for non-OECD Europe and Eurasia in the IEO2016  Reference case. Total CO2 emissions in non-OECD Europe and Eurasia increase  only slightly, from 2.9 billion metric tons in 2012 to 3.2 billion metric tons  in 2040, in part because of Russia&rsquo;s projected population decline and  increasing reliance on nuclear power to meet electricity demand in the future.  Natural gas continues to be the region&rsquo;s leading source of energy-related CO2  emissions throughout the projection, accounting for 69% of regional  energy-related CO2 emissions growth from 2012 to 2040.</p>
    <h2>IEO2016 factors influencing trends in energy-related  CO2 emissions</h2>
    <p>Many factors influence a country&rsquo;s level of CO2 emissions.  Two key measures provide useful insights for the analysis of trends in  energy-related emissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>carbon  intensity of energy consumption</em> is a measure of the amount of CO2 associated  with each unit of energy used. It directly links changes in CO2 emissions  levels with changes in energy usage. Carbon emissions vary by energy source, with coal being the most carbon-intensive major fuel, followed by oil and natural gas. Nuclear power and some renewable energy sources (i.e., solar and wind) do not directly generate CO2 emissions. Consequently, changes in the fuel mix alter overall carbon intensity. Over time, declining carbon intensity can offset increasing energy consumption to some extent. If energy consumption increased and carbon intensity decreased by a proportional factor, energy-related CO2 emissions would remain constant. A decline in carbon intensity can indicate a shift away from fossil fuels, a shift towards less carbon-intensive fossil fuels, or both.</li>
<li>The energy intensity of economic activity is a measure of energy consumption per unit of economic activity, as measured by GDP. It relates changes in energy consumption to changes in economic output. Increased energy use and economic growth generally occur together, although the degree to which they are linked varies across regions, stages of economic development, and the mix of products produced.</li></ul>

<p>As with carbon intensity, regional energy intensities do not  necessarily remain constant over time. Energy intensity can be indicative of  the energy efficiency of an economy&rsquo;s capital stock (vehicles, appliances,  manufacturing equipment, power plants, etc.). For example, if an old power  plant is replaced with a more thermally efficient unit, it is possible to meet  the same level of electricity demand with a lower level of primary energy  consumption, thereby decreasing energy intensity.</p>
<p>  Energy intensity is acutely affected by structural changes  within an economyâ€”in particular, the relative shares of its output sectors  (manufacturing versus service, for example). Higher concentrations of  energy-intensive industries, such as oil and natural gas extraction, will yield  higher overall energy intensities, whereas countries with proportionately  larger service sectors will tend to have lower energy intensities.</p>
  <p>Carbon intensity multiplied by energy intensity provides a  measure of CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP (CO2/GDP)â€”that is, the carbon  intensity of economic output. Carbon intensity of output is another common  measure used in analysis of changes in CO2 emissions, and it is sometimes used  as a standalone measure. However, when the goal is to determine the relative  strengths of forces driving changes in carbon intensity, disaggregation of the  components helps to determine whether a change in carbon intensity is the  result of a change in the country&rsquo;s fuel mix or a change in the relative energy  intensity of its economic activity.</p>
<h2>The Kaya decomposition of emissions trends</h2>
<p>The Kaya Identity provides an intuitive approach to the  interpretation of historical trends and future projections of energy-related  CO2 emissions [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#344">344</a>].  It can be used to decompose total CO2 emissions as the product of individual  factors that explicitly link energy-related CO2 emissions to energy  consumption, the level of economic output as measured by gross domestic product  (<em>GDP</em>), and population size.</p>
  <p>The Kaya Identity expresses total CO2 emissions as the  product of (1) carbon intensity of energy consumption (<em>CO2/E</em>), (2) energy intensity of economic activity (<em>E/GDP</em>), (3) economic output per capita (<em>GDP/POP</em>), and (4) population (POP):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>CO2 = (CO2 / E) (E / GDP)&times;(GDP / POP)&times; POP</em>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Using 2012 data as an example, world energy-related CO2  emissions totaled 32.2 billion metric tons in that year, world energy  consumption totaled 549 quadrillion Btu, world GDP totaled $94.46 trillion, and  the total world population was 7.073 billion. Using those figures in the Kaya  equation yields the following: 58.6 metric tons CO2 per billion Btu of energy (<em>CO2/E</em>), 5.8 thousand Btu of energy per  dollar of GDP (<em>E/GDP</em>), and $13,355 output  per capita (<em>GDP/POP</em>). Appendix J shows  calculations of the Kaya factors for all IEO2016 regions over the projection  period.</p>
    <p>Of the four Kaya components, policymakers generally focus on  the energy intensity of economic output (E/GDP) and CO2 intensity of the energy  supply (<em>CO2/E</em>). Reducing growth in  per-capita output may have a mitigating influence on emissions, but governments  generally pursue policies to increase rather than reduce output per capita to  advance economic objectives.</p>
   <p>Policies related to energy intensity of GDP typically  involve improvements to energy efficiency. However, the measure is also  sensitive to shifts in the energy-intensive portion of a country&rsquo;s trade  balance, and improvements may simply reflect a greater reliance on imports of  manufactured goods. If the country producing the imported goods is less energy  efficient, a greater reliance on imported goods could lead to a worldwide  increase in energy consumption and related CO2 emissions. Policies related to  the CO2 intensity of energy supply typically focus on promotion of low-carbon  or zero-carbon sources of energy.</p>
<p>With all of the components of the Kaya identity  having small annual percentage rates of change, the percentage rate of change  in CO2 emission levels over time approximates the sum of the component percentage  rate of change. <a href="table9-3.cfm.html">Table 9-3</a> shows the average rates of change in total CO2  emissions and each individual Kaya component from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case. The most significant driver of growth in energy-related CO2  emissions is economic output per capita. The average annual growth rate of  output per capita for non-OECD countries (3.2% from 2012 to 2040) in particular  dominates all other Kaya components in the 28-year projection. For OECD  countries, on the other hand, the 1.6% average annual increase in output per  capita is nearly offset by the 1.4% annual decline in energy intensity.</p>
<p>Except  for Japan and Russia&#8212;where population is expected to decline from 2012 to  2040&#8212;population growth is also a contributing factor to emissions increases,  along with output per capita. The Kaya identity separates population (POP)  growth from output per capita (GDP/POP) so that the influence of the two  components of total GDP growth can be measured. As indicated in Table 9-3, in  all regions population growth is less than the growth of output per capita. For  non-OECD countries, increases in output per capita coupled with population  growth overwhelm improvements in energy intensity and carbon intensity.  Although the same was true for the OECD countries from 1990 to 2012, the  projection horizon shows OECD growth in output per capita and population  largely balanced by reductions in energy intensity and carbon intensity (Figure  9-9, Figure 9-10, and Figure 9-11).</p>

<p>Over the 2012&#8211;40 projection period, the energy intensity of  economic output declines in all IEO2016 regions. The trend is particularly  pronounced in the non-OECD countries, where energy intensity of output  decreases by an average of 2.2%/year, compared with a decrease of 1.4%/year in  the OECD countries. Worldwide, the most significant decline in the energy  intensity of output is projected for China, at 2.8%/year. However, that decline  is offset by a projected increase in China's output per capita, averaging  4.6%/year over the same period.</p>
<p>Carbon intensity of energy supply is projected  to decline in all IEO2016 regions from 2012 to 2040, but to a lesser extent  than energy intensity. The combined decrease in carbon intensity for the  non-OECD countries is slightly larger than the combined decrease for the OECD  countries&#8212;0.5%/year versus 0.3%/year. With the effects of the U.S. CPP  included, the rate of decline in carbon intensity for the OECD countries is  0.4%/year. China's projected decrease in energy intensity is the largest, averaging  0.8%/year. In most regions, decreases in the energy consumption shares for  liquid fuels and coal (the most carbon-intensive fuels), combined with  increases in the shares for renewable energy, nuclear power, and natural gas,  reduce the global carbon intensity of energy supply.</p>
