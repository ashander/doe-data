        <h1>Chapter 3. Natural gas</h1>
        <div align="right"><a class="ico_pdf" href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/nat_gas.pdf"> print version</a></div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Consumption of natural gas worldwide is projected to  increase from 120 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2012 to 203 Tcf in 2040 in the <em>International Energy Outlook 2016 </em>(IEO2016)  Reference case. By energy source, natural gas accounts for the largest increase  in world primary energy consumption. Abundant natural gas resources and robust  production contribute to the strong competitive position of natural gas among  other resources. Natural gas remains a key fuel in the electric power sector  and in the industrial sector. In the power sector, natural gas is an attractive  choice for new generating plants because of its fuel efficiency. Natural gas  also burns cleaner than coal or petroleum products, and as more governments  begin implementing national or regional plans to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2)  emissions, they may encourage the use of natural gas to displace more  carbon-intensive coal and liquid fuels.</p>
<p>World consumption of natural gas for industrial uses  increases by an average of 1.7%/year, and natural gas consumption in the  electric power sector increases by 2.2%/year, from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case. The industrial and electric power sectors together account for  73% of the total increase in world natural gas consumption, and they account  for about 74% of total natural gas consumption through 2040.</p>
<p>Consumption of natural gas increases in every  IEO region, with demand in nations outside the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) increasing more than twice as fast as in  the OECD (Figure 3-1). The strongest growth in natural gas consumption is  projected for the countries of non-OECD Asia, where economic growth leads to  increased demand. Natural gas consumption in the non-OECD region grows by an  average of 2.5%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared with 1.1%/year in the OECD  countries. As a result, non-OECD countries account for 76% of the total world  increment in natural gas consumption, and their share of world natural gas use grows  from 52% in 2012 to 62% in 2040.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-1.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-1.png" alt="Figure 3-1. World natural gas consumption, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
<p>To  meet the rising natural gas demand projected in the IEO2016 Reference case, the  world&rsquo;s natural gas producers increase supplies by nearly 69% from 2012 to  2040. The largest increases in natural gas production from 2012 to 2040 occur  in non-OECD Asia (18.7 Tcf), the Middle East (16.6 Tcf), and the OECD Americas  (15.5 Tcf) (Figure 3-2). In China alone, production increases by 15.0 Tcf as  the country expands development of its shale resources. The United States and  Russia increase natural gas production by 11.3 Tcf and by 10.0 Tcf,  respectively. In Russia, production growth is supported primarily by increasing  development of resources in the country&rsquo;s Arctic and eastern regions. U.S.  production growth comes mainly from shale resources. Total natural gas production  in China, the United States, and Russia accounts for nearly 44% of the overall increase  in world natural gas production.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-2.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-2.png" alt="Figure 3-2. World increase in natural gas production by country grouping, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-2_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
<p>Although  there is more to learn about the extent of the world&rsquo;s tight gas, shale gas,  and coalbed methane resource base, the IEO2016 Reference case projects a  substantial increase in those supplies&#8212;especially in China, the United States,  and Canada (Figure 3-3). The application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  technologies has made it possible to develop the U.S. shale gas resource, contributing  to a near doubling of estimates for total U.S. technically recoverable natural  gas resources over the past decade. Shale gas accounts for more than half of U.S.  natural gas production in the IEO2016 Reference case, and tight gas, shale gas,  and coalbed methane resources in Canada and China account for about 80% of  total production in 2040 in those countries.</p>
  <p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-3.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-3.png" alt="Figure 3-3. Natural gas production by type in China, Canada, and the United States, 2012 and 2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-3_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
       
      <p>Liquefied  natural gas (LNG) accounts for a growing share of world natural gas trade in  the Reference case. World LNG trade more than doubles, from about 12 Tcf in  2012 to 29 Tcf in 2040. Most of the increase in liquefaction capacity occurs  in Australia and North America, where a multitude of new liquefaction projects  are planned or under construction, many of which will become operational within  the next decade. At the same time, existing facilities in North Africa and  Southeast Asia have been underutilized or are shutting down because of  production declines at many of the older fields associated with the  liquefaction facilities, and because domestic natural gas consumption is more  highly valued than exports.</p>
      <h2>OECD natural gas consumption</h2>
      <h4>OECD Americas</h4>
<p>Annual natural gas consumption in the OECD  Americas region rises steadily to 40.1 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-4), including  increases of 1.0 Tcf from 2012 to 2020 (0.4%/year) and 7.3 Tcf from 2020 to  2040 (1.0%/year). The OECD Americas region accounts for 41% of the total  increase in natural gas use by OECD countries and 13% of the increase in total world  natural gas consumption over the projection period.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-4.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-4.png" alt="Figure 3-4. OECD Americas natural gas consumption by country, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-4_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>The  United States&#8212;the world's largest consumer of natural gas&#8212;leads the OECD  Americas region in annual natural gas consumption growth with an increase of 4.2  Tcf from 2012 to 2040, or 51% of the region&rsquo;s total increase (Figure 3-5). While  the recently finalized Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations in the United States are  not included in the IEO2016 Reference case, its effects are considered in  discussions, tables, and figures throughout the report, based on prior U.S. Energy  Information Administration (EIA) analysis of the proposed rule that has similar  elements. With implementation of the proposed CPP, U.S. natural gas consumption  would be 1.7 Tcf higher in 2020 compared to the IEO2016 Reference case. Most of  the increase in natural gas consumption would occur in the electric power  sector as a substitute for coal-fired generation. After 2020, the effect of the  CPP on natural gas use in the power sector decreases as generation from  renewable energy increases. In 2040, projected U.S. natural gas consumption is  1.0 Tcf lower with the CPP than in the IEO2016 Reference case. Effects of the  final CPP on natural-gas-fired generation will depend on natural gas prices,  renewable technology costs, and state-level implementation decisions. An  increase in natural gas use through 2040 is certainly possible in scenarios  with low gas prices and implementation strategies that favor gas.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-5.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-5.png" alt="Figure 3-5. OECD Americas change in natural gas consumption by country and end-use sector, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-5_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Projections for combined annual natural gas consumption in  Mexico and Chile include absolute growth in the two countries of 2.2 Tcf (26%  of the OECD Americas total increase), followed by Canada with 1.9 Tcf (23% of  the OECD Americas total increase). Increasingly, Mexico has met its growing  demand for electricity with generation from natural gas-fired units, using  natural gas imported by pipeline from the United States, particularly since  2011 as the growth of Mexico&rsquo;s overall natural gas consumption has outstripped  its domestic production growth. In the IEO2016 Reference case, the electric  power sector accounts for 39% (3.2 Tcf) of the growth in natural gas  consumption from 2012 to 2040 in the OECD Americas region, with 1.6 Tcf of the  increase occurring in Mexico and Chile and 1.3 Tcf in Canada.</p>
<p>Natural gas use in the OECD Americas industrial sector grows  by 1.4 Tcf from 2012 to 2020, with 1.3 Tcf (97%) added in the United States,  where industrial consumption increases by an average of 1.8%/year. The growth of  natural gas use in the U.S. industrial sector slows somewhat from 2020 to 2040 averaging  0.5%/year and increasing by a total of 1.0 Tcf over that period. In Canada,  natural gas consumption in the industrial sector grows by an average of 0.2%/year  from 2012 to 2020 and by 1.1%/year from 2020 to 2040. In the Mexico/Chile  region, industrial sector natural gas use grows by averages of 0.1%/year from  2010 to 2020 and 1.2%/year from 2020 to 2040.</p>
<h4>OECD Europe</h4>
<p>Natural gas consumption in the OECD Europe region  grows by 1.3%/year on average, from 17.8 Tcf in 2012 to 25.3 Tcf in 2040 in the  Reference case (Figure 3-6), with the electric power sector accounting for more  than one-half (4.6 Tcf) of the total increase. The average increase of  3.6%/year in natural gas consumption for power generation from 2020 to 2040 is  higher than for any other energy source used in the sector. The share of  natural gas in the power generation mix is projected to grow, as older nuclear and  coal-fired units will be gradually decommissioned and replaced primarily by new  natural gas-fired and renewable capacity.</p>

<div class="tie_correction">
        <h4>Natural gas prices in Asia</h4>
        <p>In  Asian markets, unlike those in the United States, natural gas prices typically  reflect contracts that are indexed to prices for crude oil or petroleum  products. The declines in crude oil prices between August 2014 and January 2015  and low oil prices since then (Figure 3-7) had a significant effect on Asian  natural gas prices and markets. However, Asian countries are developing  regional trading hubs to set natural gas prices that better reflect natural gas  market dynamics. In 2014, almost 30% of global trade in LNG occurred on a  short-term [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#54">54</a>] or spot basis. Asian countries accounted for three-quarters of that total and  one-third of the global natural gas trade [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#55">55</a>].  From 2011 to 2014, high crude oil prices resulted in higher prices for LNG  imports. In Asia, most natural gas is imported as LNG, with LNG prices traditionally  indexed to crude oil on a long-term, contractual basis. </p>
        
        <p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-7.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-7.png" alt="Figure 3-7. World crude oil, natural gas, and liquefied natural gas prices, 2010&#8211;15" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-7_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
     <p>Currently  there is no globally integrated market for natural gas, and pricing mechanisms  vary by regional market. In most cases, internationally traded natural gas is  indexed to crude oil prices, such as North Sea Brent or Japan customs-cleared  crude (JCC), because of the liquidity and transparency of crude oil prices and  the substitutability of natural gas and petroleum products in some markets. For  example, some Asian countries have the option to burn either natural gas or  petroleum for electricity generation.</p>
<p>Although long-term contracts indexed to crude  oil prices remain Asia&rsquo;s predominant pricing mechanism, natural gas is  beginning to be traded in one-time transactions on the spot market, or under  short-term contracts that more closely reflect international natural gas supply  and demand balances. Short-term and spot LNG trade in the Asia Pacific market almost  tripled from 2010 to 2014 (Figure 3-8), when it represented 21% of global LNG  trade and 7% of natural gas trade.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-8.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-8.png" alt="Figure 3-8. Asia Pacific natural gas trade by country and contract type, 2010 and 2014" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-8_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Several  Asian countries&mdash;including Japan, China, and Singapore&#8212;are developing regional  trading hubs with the goal of increasing price formation transparency:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In September 2014, Japan launched an LNG futures  contract on the Japan over-the-counter exchange (JOE), settled against the Rim  Intelligence Co. Daily Pricing Index. However, only one trade has been made on the  JOE since its inception. The country's lack of pipeline connectivity with other  markets, low volumes of flexible LNG, and lack of LNG price transparency and  liquidity have limited spot LNG trading activity on the JOE.</li>
  <li>In June 2015, Singapore's Stock Exchange  launched the Singapore SGX LNG Index Group (SLInG). The index will provide free-on-board  prices (excluding shipping costs) for LNG cargos from Singapore to different  destinations reflecting regional spot prices. As of June 2015, 13 market players  had signed up to participate in the index, and 10 more were expected to join; however,  trading volumes to date have been moderate.</li>
  <li>On July 1, 2015, China launched the Shanghai Oil  and Gas Exchange, which will trade both pipeline gas and LNG. China&rsquo;s  diversified natural gas market, with expanding pipeline infrastructure and  gas-on-gas competition, may offer a more liquid Asian natural gas price index,  but high levels of government regulation make it less attractive as a regional  benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Europe, where natural gas is imported both by  pipeline and as LNG, natural gas prices are either indexed to crude oil prices or  based on the spot market. Although most of trade in Europe is based on  long-term contracts, hub-based spot trading has increased significantly over the past decade. The primary benchmark prices for spot trading are the National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United Kingdom and the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands. The NBP and TTF prices have a strong influence on hub prices in other European markets because of their liquidity and interconnectivity with continental Europe. Other trading hubs in continental Europe are growing in terms of traded volumes and the numbers of hubs and participants. With the increasing volumes and liquidity in the European hubs, hub pricing is beginning to play a larger role. Some recent pipeline contracts in continental Europe now include a hub-based price, rather than a traditional linkage to a basket of crude oil products.</p>
<p>Prices at Henry Hub, the U.S. natural gas benchmark, can also affect global pricing through LNG trade. By 2020, when all current U.S. liquefaction projects are expected to be completed, the United States will account for almost one-fifth of global liquefaction capacity and will have the third-largest LNG export capacity in the world (after Qatar and Australia).</p>
<p>Almost 80% of U.S. LNG export volumes for projects currently under construction have been contracted on pricing terms directly linked to the Henry Hub price, or under a hybrid pricing mechanism with links to Henry Hub. The flexibility of destination clauses in U.S. LNG export contracts and the introduction of hub indexes are expected to promote greater liquidity in global LNG trading, shift pricing away from oil-based indexes, and contribute to the development of Asian regional trading hubs and pricing indexes.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>OECD Asia</h4>
      <p>Natural gas consumption in OECD Asia grows by an average of 1.6%/year  in the IEO2016 Reference case, from 7.9 Tcf in 2012 to 12.2 Tcf in 2040, with  Japan&rsquo;s consumption increasing by an average of 0.9%/year. Japan has relied  primarily on short-term and spot cargo shipments of LNG to offset the loss of  nuclear generating capacity when a large part of its nuclear generation  capacity was shut down after the Fukushima Daiichi power reactors were severely  damaged by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. All but 2 of the country&rsquo;s 50  reactors remained offline as of January 2016 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#56">56</a>],  and environmental concerns have led the government to encourage natural gas  consumption, making LNG a fuel of choice for power generation to substitute for  the lost nuclear generation. According to the International Gas Union, Japan  operated 23 major LNG import terminals in 2014, including expansions and  satellite terminals, with the total gas send-out capacity of 9 Tcf/year being well  in excess of demand [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#57">57</a>].  From 2020 to 2040, Japan&rsquo;s real GDP increases by an average of 0.5%/year, by  far the lowest in the region, as a result of its declining population and aging  work force. Although Japan&rsquo;s natural gas consumption does not slow between 2020  and 2040, its consumption of energy from liquids and coal does decline. As a  result, the natural gas share of Japan&rsquo;s total energy consumption rises from  25% in 2020 to nearly 30% in 2040.</p>
        <p>South Korea's natural gas consumption grows at average rates  of 2.3%/year from 2012 to 2020 and 1.7%/year from 2020 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case. Growth in demand for natural gas in the South Korea's industrial,  residential, and commercial sectors slows, while in the electric power sector it  remains above 2%/year throughout the 2012&#8211;40 period.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have OECD Asia's  strongest average annual growth in electricity sector natural gas consumption  from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, averaging 4.6%/year and more  than tripling, from 0.4 Tcf in 2012 to 1.5 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-9). Australia  increases the share of natural gas in its power generation mix to
reduce  its more carbon-intensive coal-fired generation. The two countries' combined  share of OECD Asia&rsquo;s total natural gas use for electricity generation grows  from 10% in 2012 to 21% in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>

     <h2>Non-OECD natural gas consumption</h2>
     <h4>Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia</h4>
<p>The countries of non-OECD Europe and Eurasia  relied on natural gas for 47% of their primary energy needs in 2012&mdash;the second  highest of any country grouping in IEO2016, after the Middle East. Non-OECD  Europe and Eurasia consumed a total of 23.0 Tcf of natural gas in 2012, the  most outside the OECD and more than any other region in the world except the  OECD Americas. Russia&rsquo;s 15.7 Tcf of natural gas consumption in 2012 accounted  for 68% of the Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia region&rsquo;s total (Figure 3-10).</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-10.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-10.png" alt="Figure 3-10. Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia natural gas consumption, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-10_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>In  the IEO2016 Reference case, overall natural gas consumption in non-OECD Europe  and Eurasia grows by an average of 0.4%/year from 2012 to 2040, including a  decline of 0.3%/year from 2012 to 2020 and an increase of 0.7%/year from 2020  to 2040, for a total increase of 2.9 Tcf over the 2012&#8211;40 period. With Russia  accounting for only about 10% of the region&rsquo;s total increase, the average  increase for the rest of the non-OECD Europe and Eurasia region is 1.1%/year, compared with Russia's average of 0.1%/year. In the electric  power sector, natural gas consumption falls by an average of 0.1%/year from  2012 to 2040 in Russia as growth in its overall energy use slows but grows by  an average of 1.4%/year in the region&rsquo;s other countries.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Asia</h4>
<p>Among all regions of the world, the fastest  growth in natural gas consumption in the IEO2016 Reference case occurs in  non-OECD Asia. Natural gas use in non-OECD Asia increases by an average of 4.4%/year,  from 15.1 Tcf in 2012 to 50.8 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-11). Over the period,  non-OECD Asia accounts for more than 40% of the total incremental growth in  world natural gas use, moving from its current position as the world&rsquo;s  fourth-largest natural gas consuming region to the second-largest natural gas  consuming region in 2030 and the largest consumer in 2040. OECD Asia&rsquo;s total  natural gas consumption increases from less than half that of the OECD Americas  region in 2012 to more than 25% above the OECD Americas total in 2040, and its  share of total world natural gas consumption increases from 13% in 2012 to 25%  in 2040.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-11.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-11.png" alt="Figure 3-11. Non-OECD Asia natural gas consumption by region, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-11_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>China accounts for almost two-thirds (63%) of the growth in non-OECD  Asia's natural gas consumption from 2012 to 2040. Total consumption of natural  gas in China increases by an average of 6.2%/year in the IEO2016 Reference  case, from 5.1 Tcf in 2012 to 27.5 Tcf in 2040. China&rsquo;s central government is  promoting natural gas as a preferred energy source and has set an ambitious  target of increasing the share of natural gas in its overall energy mix to 10%  (or approximately 8.8 Tcf) by 2020 to alleviate pollution from its heavy coal  use [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#58">58</a>].  In the IEO2016 Reference case, natural gas consumption in China totals 9.1 Tcf  in 2020, or about 6% of the country&rsquo;s total energy consumption. In 2040, the  natural gas share of China&rsquo;s energy consumption is 15%&#8212;still less than coal&rsquo;s  44% share. However, the 6.2% average annual growth rate for natural gas  consumption from 2012 to 2040 is far below the 9.7% average growth rate for  nuclear energy.</p>
<p>In India, natural gas accounted for about 8% of total  energy consumption in 2012, almost double the share in China's energy mix. In  other countries of non-OECD Asia, natural gas use accounts for 23% of overall  energy consumption in 2012, and its share rises to 25% in 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case, as natural gas consumption increases by an average of 2.8%/year,  from 7.9 Tcf in 2012 to 17.2 Tcf in 2040. Although natural gas remains the  second-largest source of energy consumption after liquids, its annual growth rate  is less than the rates for renewables (3.4%) and nuclear energy (2.9%).</p>
<h4>Middle East</h4>
<p>In the Middle East region, natural gas accounted  for almost half of total energy consumption in 2012, more than in any other  region. In the IEO2016 Reference case, Middle East natural gas consumption  increases by an average of 2.5%/year from 2012 to 2040, and the industrial  sector accounts for the largest share of the region&rsquo;s total natural gas  consumption (Figure 3-12). Natural gas use in the industrial sector grows by  7.7 Tcf from 2012 to 2040, accounting for more than half of the 14.2 Tcf total  increase in natural gas consumption. In the electric power sector, natural gas  use grows by 5.2 Tcf from 2012 to 2040, when it totals 9.8 Tcf. Natural  gas-fired generation gains a portion of the market as the use of crude oil for electricity  generation declines.</p>

<h4>Africa</h4>
<p>Africa's natural gas consumption totals 11.1 Tcf  in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, or 2.5 times the 2012 total (Figure 3-13).  The region&rsquo;s natural gas use increases by an average of 3.3%/year from 2012 to  2040, a rate that is second only to the 4.4%/year average increase for nuclear  energy over the same period. Africa's electric power and industrial sectors  account for 79% of the increase in the region's demand for natural gas from  2012 to 2040 and for 84% of its total natural gas demand in 2040. Natural gas  consumption in the electric power sector grows from 2.2 Tcf in 2012 to 5.5 Tcf  in 2040, accounting for 49% of the total increase in Africa&rsquo;s natural gas use  over the period. More than 85% of the increase in natural gas use for  electricity generation in Africa occurs from 2020 to 2040, when it averages  3.6%/year, as compared with an average of less than 2.5%/year from 2012 to  2020.</p>

<h4>Non-OECD Americas</h4>
<p>Natural gas consumption in the non-OECD Americas  region increases by an average of 2.0%/year in the IEO2016 Reference case, from  5.1 Tcf in 2012 to 8.9 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-14). The industrial sector  accounts for more than one-third of the consumption growth from 2012 to 2040,  followed by the electric power sector at approximately one-quarter. Brazil&rsquo;s  natural gas consumption grows by an average of 2.6%/year from 2012 to 2040, or  by a total of 1.1 Tcf&mdash;more than 25% of the overall increase of 3.9 Tcf for the  non-OECD Americas region. The increase from 0.7 Tcf in 2012 to 1.4 Tcf in 2040  in Brazil&rsquo;s industrial sector natural gas consumption accounts for more than  60% of the country&rsquo;s total increase in natural gas use from 2012 to 2040.  Consumption of natural gas in both the industrial and electric power sectors  grows by approximately 2.3%/year from 2012 to 2040, when the industrial sector  accounts for 64% and the electric power sector accounts for 22% of Brazil&rsquo;s total  natural gas consumption.</p>

<h2>World natural gas production</h2>
<p>To meet projected growth in natural gas use in  the IEO2016 Reference case, the world's natural gas supplies increase by nearly  83 Tcf (69%) from 2012 to 2040. Much of the increase in supply is projected to  come from non-OECD countries, which  in the Reference case account for 73% of the total increase in world natural  gas production from 2012 to 2040. Non-OECD natural gas production grows by an  average of 2.1%/year, from 75 Tcf in 2012 to 136 Tcf in 2040 (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/table3-1.cfm">Table 3-1</a>), while  OECD production grows by 1.4%/year, from 44 Tcf to 66 Tcf.</p>
<p>Production from continuous  resources grows rapidly in the projection, with OECD tight gas, shale gas, and  coalbed methane production averaging 3.0%/year, from 20 trillion cubic in 2012  to 47 Tcf in 2040. Over the same period, non-OECD production of tight gas,  shale gas, and coalbed methane grows from nearly 2 Tcf to 34 Tcf. However,  numerous uncertainties could affect future production of those resources. There  is still considerable variation among estimates of recoverable shale gas  resources in the United States and Canada, and estimates of recoverable tight  gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane for the rest of the world are more  uncertain, given the sparse data currently available. Moreover, the hydraulic  fracturing process used to produce shale gas resources often requires  significant amounts of water, and available water supplies are limited in many  of the world regions that have been identified as possessing shale gas  resources. Further environmental concerns can also add to the uncertainty  surrounding access to shale gas resources.</p>
<h4>OECD production</h4>
<h5>OECD Americas</h5>
<p>Natural gas production in the OECD Americas  grows by 49% from 2012 to 2040. The United States, which is the largest  producer in the OECD Americas and in the OECD as a whole, accounts for more  than two-thirds of the region's total production growth from 24 Tcf in 2012 to  35 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-15). U.S. shale gas production grows from 10 Tcf in  2012 to 20 Tcf in 2040, more than offsetting declines in production of natural  gas from other sources. In 2040, shale gas accounts for 55% of total U.S.  natural gas production in the IEO2016 Reference case, tight gas accounts for  20%, and offshore  production from the Lower 48 states accounts for 8%. The remaining 17% comes  from coalbed methane, Alaska, and other associated and nonassociated onshore  resources in the Lower 48 states.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-15.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-15.png" alt="Figure 3-15. OECD natural gas production by country and region, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-15_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Natural gas production in Canada grows by 1.2%/year on  average over the projection period, from 6.1 Tcf in 2012 to 8.6 Tcf in 2040. In  Canada, like in the United States, much of the production growth comes from  growing volumes of tight gas and shale gas production.</p>
<p>Mexico's natural gas production is relatively flat in the  midterm, but it more than doubles in the later years of the projection, as production  from shale gas resources grows, supported by the country's recent energy reforms.  Total natural gas production in Mexico increases from 1.7 Tcf in 2012 to 3.3  Tcf in 2040. Like Canada and the United States, Mexico is thought to have  substantial shale gas resources, the most prospective of which are extensions  of the successful Eagle Ford Shale in the United States. However, because the  shale resources in Mexico have not been explored as fully as those in the rest  of North America, there is more uncertainty surrounding estimates of their size  and potential for production.</p>
<h4>OECD Europe</h4>
<p>Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom  are the three largest producers of natural gas in OECD Europe, accounting for more  than 80% of the region's total natural gas production in 2012. In the IEO2016  Reference case, OECD Europe&rsquo;s natural gas production declines in the mid-term  and then begins to grow again in the later part of the projection, as  production from tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane resources becomes  more significant (Figure 3-16). Overall, natural gas production in OECD Europe  in 2040 is 1.6 Tcf higher than in 2012. Contributing to OECD Europe's total production  is the growth in natural gas production from Israel, which became an OECD  member country in September 2010 and is included in OECD Europe for statistical  reporting purposes.</p>

      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-16_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<h4>OECD Asia</h4>
<p>Natural gas production in the Australia/New Zealand region increases  from 2.1 Tcf in 2012 to 7.0 Tcf in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, at an  average rate of 4.4%/year. In 2012, more than 90% of production in the  Australia/New Zealand region came from Australia, with production in Western  Australia (including the Northwest Shelf area of Australia's Carnarvon Basin)  accounting for approximately 58% of the country&rsquo;s total production [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#59">59</a>].  Much of Australia's production is used as feedstock at the Northwest Shelf LNG  liquefaction facility. Similarly, many of Australia&rsquo;s new natural gas field  developments are tied to liquefaction projects that have several export  contracts in place.</p>
  <p>Both Japan and South Korea have limited natural gas  resources. Consequently, they have limited current production and limited  prospects for future production. Both countries receive most of their natural  gas supplies in the form of imported LNG. In 2012, natural gas production in Japan  accounted for only 3% of the country's natural gas consumption, and in South  Korea domestic natural gas production accounted for less than 1% of natural gas  consumption. Although substantial deposits of methane hydrates in both Japan  and South Korea have been confirmed, both countries are investigating how those  resources could be safely and economically developed. The IEO2016 Reference  case does not include methane hydrate resources in its estimates of natural gas  resources, and widespread development of hydrates on a commercial scale is not  anticipated during the projection period.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD production</h4>
<h4>Middle East</h4>
<p>The three largest natural gas producers in the  Middle East&mdash;Iran, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia&mdash;together accounted for 76% of the natural  gas produced in the Middle East in 2012. With more than 40% of the world&rsquo;s  proved natural gas reserves, the Middle East accounts for 20% of the total  increase in world natural gas production in the IEO2016 Reference case, from  19.2 Tcf in 2012 to 35.8 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-17).</p>

<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-17.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-17.png" alt="Figure 3-17. Middle East natural gas production by country, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-17_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
<p>The strongest growth among Middle East producers from 2012  to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case comes from Iran, where natural gas production  increases by 6.8 Tcf, followed by Saudi Arabia (3.4 Tcf of new production) and  Qatar (2.9 Tcf). Although Iraq is the region&rsquo;s fastest-growing supplier of  natural gas, with average increases of 15%/year over the projection period, it  remains a relatively minor contributor to regional natural gas supplies. In  2040, Iraq&rsquo;s natural gas production totals 1.0 Tcf, or about 3% of the Middle  East total.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia</h4>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, 15% of the global  increase in natural gas production comes from non-OECD Europe and Eurasia,  which includes Russia, Central Asia, and non-OECD Europe. In the region as a  whole, natural gas production increases from 28.5 Tcf in 2012 to 40.9 Tcf in  2040 (Figure 3-18). Russia remains the largest natural gas producer, accounting  for more than 75% of the region&rsquo;s total production over the projection period.  In the IEO2016 Reference case, Russia&rsquo;s natural gas production grows on average  by 1.4%/year from 2012 to 2040, supported primarily by growth in exports to  both Europe and Asia.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-18.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-18.png" alt="Figure 3-18. Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia natural gas production, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-18_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Natural gas production in Central Asia, which includes the  former Soviet Republics, grows by 0.9%/year on average, from 5.5 Tcf in 2012 to  7.1 Tcf in 2040. Much of the projected growth is in Turkmenistan, which already  is a major natural gas producer, accounting for 44% of the region&rsquo;s total  production in 2012. Also contributing to Central Asia's production growth is  Azerbaijan. Almost all of Azerbaijan's natural gas is produced in two offshore  fields&#8212;the Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli (ACG) complex and Shah Deniz. The  second phase of Shah Deniz development is expected to start producing in 2018, with  a peak capacity of 565 Bcf per year (in addition to the 315 Bcf in Phase I),  according to BP, the development operator [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#60">60</a>].  When it is completed, Shah Deniz will be one of the largest natural gas  development projects in the world.</p>
<h4>Africa</h4>
<p>Natural gas production in Africa grows in the  IEO2016 Reference case from 7.6 Tcf in 2012 to 9.8 Tcf in 2020 and 16.5 Tcf in  2040 (Figure 3-19). In 2012, about three-quarters of Africa&rsquo;s natural gas was  produced in North Africa, mainly in Algeria, Egypt, and Libya. West Africa (with  Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea providing virtually all of West Africa&rsquo;s  production) accounted for another 23% of the 2012 total, and the rest of Africa  accounted for 3%. Remaining resources in West Africa are more promising than those  in North Africa, which has been producing large volumes of natural gas over a  much longer period. Accordingly, in the IEO2016 Reference case, production  growth in West Africa is higher than in North Africa, with annual increases  over the projection period averaging 5.6%/year and 1.1%/year, respectively.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-19.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-19.png" alt="Figure 3-19. Africa natural gas production by region, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-19_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Nigeria  is the largest natural gas producer in West Africa, although there also have  been recent production increases in Equatorial Guinea, which brought an LNG  liquefaction facility online in 2007. Angola was expected to add to West Africa's  production in the near term with the startup of its first LNG liquefaction  facility in 2013. However, in April 2014, Angola LNG temporarily shut down the  plant because of ongoing technical issues, which led to infrequent exports  while it was open. Technical issues at the plant included electrical fires,  pipeline leaks and ruptures, and a collapsed drilling rig. Recommissioning of  the Angola LNG plant began in January 2016 and operator Chevron expects the  first LNG shipment to occur in the second quarter of 2016 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#61">61</a>].</p>
<p>In Nigeria, security concerns and uncertainty over terms of  access have delayed proposed export projects and limited mid-term production  growth. In the IEO2016 Reference case, export projects in Nigeria regain their  former momentum later in the projection period, raising production for the West  Africa region from 1.7 Tcf in 2012 to 7.9 Tcf in 2040. West Africa's share of the  continent's total natural gas production more than doubles in the IEO2016  Reference case, from 23% in 2012 to 48% in 2040.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Asia</h4>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, natural gas  production in non-OECD Asia more than doubles from 2012 to 2040, increasing by  18.7 Tcf (Figure 3-20). Growth from production in China accounts for 80% of  this increase. From 2012 to 2040, China has the largest increase in natural gas  production in non-OECD Asia, from 3.7 Tcf in 2012 to 18.7 Tcf in 2040, growing  at an annual average rate of 6.0%. Much of the increase in the latter years  comes from tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane reservoirs. China already  is producing small volumes of coalbed methane and significant volumes of tight  gas (Figure 3-21) (<a href="nat_gas.cfm.html#shalegas">see &quot;Shale  gas development in China: Government investment and decreasing well costs&quot;</a>).</p>

      <div class="tie_correction">
        <h4><a name="shalegas"></a>Shale gas development in China: Government investment and decreasing well costs</h4>
  <p>As  China continues to invest in domestic oil and gas production, and as the cost of  drilling shale gas wells has fallen (Figures 3-22 and 3-23), China&rsquo;s  development of shale gas has increased. Although the Chinese energy market has  increasingly relied on imported natural gas, future shale gas production could  help to meet natural gas demand even as the country faces difficulties in  developing other natural gas resources, including coalbed methane (CBM).</p>

  <p>Over  the past 25 years, China has worked to develop its substantial CBM resources,  estimated by China's Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR) at more than 1,000  Tcf [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#62">62</a>].  Commercialization began slowly in the 1990s, with CBM exploration programs  operated by foreign companies, including BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. However,  the initial wells had low production rates, and by 2000 exploration activity  had slowed. Although well performance has not improved much since 2000, the development  of CBM supported by government loans and subsidies has accelerated. PetroChina,  China United Coalbed Methane Corporation, Jincheng Coal Group, and other  Chinese companies have reduced well costs and have benefited from higher  natural gas prices. Currently, there are more than 20,000 CBM wells in China,  producing a total of 0.36 Bcf/d. However, CBM well productivity in China is  significantly lower than in some other countries, including Australia and the  United States. CBM development in China has focused on the Ordos and Qinshui basins  in Shanxi Province, which are considered to have the country's best geologic  conditions, but significant geologic challenges&#8212;including low permeability and  undersaturation&#8212;have constrained well productivity.</p>
  <p>The  difficulty of increasing CBM output has led China to increase its efforts to develop  shale gas resources, taking an approach similar to that used for CBM development.  China&rsquo;s technically recoverable shale gas resources are estimated at 1,115 Tcf  [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#63">63</a>].  The amount that becomes economically recoverable will depend on the market  price of natural gas from foreign sources, including both pipeline gas and  liquefied natural gas, as well as the capital and operating costs and  productivity of shale gas production in China. More than 700 shale gas wells have  been drilled in China over the past 4 years, and production has reached 0.38  Bcf/d.</p>
    <p>As  Chinese companies have gained experience in shale gas production, their drilling  costs have declined. According to China National Petroleum Corporation&rsquo;s  Economics and Technology Research Institute, the cost of drilling in shale  formations in the Sichuan Basin was between $11.3 million and $12.9 million per  well in mid-2015 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#64">64</a>]&#8212;23%  lower than the cost cited in 2013 reports from Sinopec, another Chinese  national oil company [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#65">65</a>].</p>
    <p>China  has also invested heavily in joint ventures in U.S. shale plays, with its  financial involvement representing 20% of total foreign investment in U.S.  shale plays [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#66">66</a>].  This investment likely has provided China with valuable expertise that can be  applied to its own domestic production, helping to lower well development  costs.</p>
<p>Decreasing well costs and increasing experience  in developing shale gas have been supplemented by continued government  investment in the development of shale gas. In 2012, to encourage shale gas exploration,  China&rsquo;s government established a four-year subsidy program for any Chinese  company achieving commercial production of shale gas, with subsidies of $1.80  per million British thermal units. The subsidies were extended in mid-2015, at  a lower rate,  through 2020 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#67">67</a>]. Initially,  shale gas development has been focused on the Longmaxi formation in the Sichuan  Basin (Figure 3-24), which is estimated to hold 287 Tcf of technically  recoverable volumes [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#68">68</a>].</p>
<p>According to MLR, Sinopec and PetroChina are on  schedule to reach 0.6 Bcf/d of shale gas production by the end of 2015.  Although it is still a small fraction of China&rsquo;s overall production, which was estimated  at 13.0 Bcf/d in 2014 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#69">69</a>],  shale gas eventually could help to meet growing demand for natural gas in China  and limit growth in the country's natural gas imports.</p>

      </span></p>
</div>
      <h4>Non-OECD Americas</h4>
<p>Natural gas production in the non-OECD Americas region  nearly doubles in the IEO2016 Reference case, from 5.5 Tcf in 2012 to 9.4 Tcf in  2040 (Figure 3-25). Brazil's natural production grows by an average of  4.0%/year and triples from 0.6 Tcf in 2012 to 1.8 Tcf in 2040. As a result,  Brazil&rsquo;s share of regional production increases from 11% in 2012 to nearly 19%  in 2040. More than one-third of Brazil&rsquo;s natural gas production growth from  2012 to 2040 comes from tight gas, shale gas, or coalbed methane production.  Recent discoveries of oil and natural gas in the presalt Santos Basin are  expected to increase the country&rsquo;s natural gas production, particularly in the  Tupi field, which could contain between 5 Tcf and 7 Tcf of recoverable natural  gas [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#70">70</a>].</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-25.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-25.png" alt="Figure 3-25. Non-OECD Americas natural gas production, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-25_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Despite recent declines in natural gas production, countries  in the Southern Cone (mainly, Argentina) become the region&rsquo;s leading natural  gas producers by 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, with annual production in  the Southern Cone growing by nearly 150%, from 1.3 Tcf in 2012 to 3.1 Tcf in  2040. All of the production increase in the Southern Cone comes from tight gas,  shale gas, or coalbed methane gas fields, as production from other resources [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#71">71</a>]  declines over the projection period. Currently, Argentina leads the non-OECD  Americas region in its pursuit of tight gas and shale gas development.</p>
<p>While the growth of natural gas production in  Brazil and in the Southern Cone increases natural gas production in the  non-OECD Americas region overall, production from the Northern Producers  (primarily, Colombia, Venezuela, and Trinidad and Tobago) grows by an average  of 1.1%/year, which is the region's second-lowest rate of production increase, after  the Andean producers (Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru). Venezuela's 198 Tcf of proved  natural gas reserves are the Western Hemisphere&rsquo;s second-largest reserves,  after the United States. An estimated 90% of Venezuela's natural gas reserves  are associated, meaning that they are co-located with oil reserves. Although  Venezuela has plans to increase its production of nonassociated gas, largely  through the development of its offshore reserves, those plans have been delayed  by a lack of capital and foreign investment.</p>
<h2>World natural gas trade</h2>
<p>International trade in natural gas is undergoing rapid  transformation. From 2000 to 2012, global LNG trade more than doubled, from less  than 5 Tcf/year to more than 12 Tcf/year, and its growth continues in the  IEO2016 Reference case through 2020 as new liquefaction capacity comes online.  World LNG flows adjusted quickly in 2011 and 2012, to accommodate a surge in  Japan's demand for LNG in the wake of the Fukushima disaster and to account for  the underutilization of LNG liquefaction capacity in North Africa and Southeast  Asia. As nuclear capacity in Japan is restored, world LNG markets are expected  to loosen in the near term because of growing supply and weakening demand.</p>
<p>Although LNG trade has grown considerably in  recent years, flows of natural gas by pipeline still account for most of the  global natural gas trade in the IEO2016 Reference case, which includes several  new long-distance pipelines and expansions of existing infrastructure through  2040. The largest volumes of natural gas traded internationally by pipeline  currently are in North America (between Canada and the United States) and in  Europe (among many OECD and non-OECD countries). By the end of the projection  period, the IEO2016 Reference case includes large volumes of pipeline flows  into China from both Russia and Central Asia (<a href="nat_gas.cfm.html#global"><em>see &quot;Global LNG trade and supply,&quot;</em></a>).</p>
<div class="tie_correction">
        <h4><a name="global"></a>Global LNG trade  and supply
        </h4>
        <p>In 2014, natural gas  accounted for 25% of the energy used worldwide, with LNG accounting for 10% of  global natural gas consumption and 31% of global natural gas trade. From 2005  to 2014, LNG trade increased by an average of 6%/year, nearly twice the growth  rate (3.3%/year) of pipeline natural gas trade [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#72">72</a>].  In 2015, LNG trade continued to expand, by about 3%, with new liquefaction  capacity additions in Australia and Indonesia [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#73">73</a>].  In the IEO2016 Reference case, world LNG trade expands by nearly one-third from  2012 to 2020, as large volumes of new liquefaction capacity come online and as more  countries opt for LNG as a flexible source of support for their energy systems,  particularly where access to natural gas by pipeline may be limited by  geographic or economic conditions.</p>
<p>Strong growth in overall global LNG trade over  the past 10 years has been accompanied by even stronger growth in LNG trade on  spot [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#74">74</a>]  and short-term [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#75">75</a>] markets.  Short-term and spot trade in LNG, which in 2000 accounted for less than 5% of  the natural gas traded worldwide, grew from 2.5 billion cubic feet per day  (Bcf/d) in 2005 to 9.3 Bcf/d in 2014, and its share of total LNG trade  increased from 13% to 29%. The growth of short-term and spot LNG trade was aided  by a number of developments, including LNG contracts with destination  flexibility, decisions by importing countries to procure LNG without long-term  contracts, large pricing differentials between the Atlantic and Pacific basins  (which supports interbasin arbitrage), a proliferation of LNG marketers with  flexible supply portfolios, and an increase in LNG carriers available for spot  and short-term charter. The number of countries entering LNG trade has also increased  considerably, contributing to the development of more flexible trading patterns  between exporters and importers.</p>
<p>The  Asia Pacific region [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#76">76</a>],  which accounted for almost one-third of world natural gas trade and three-fourths  of LNG trade in 2014 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#77">77</a>],  led the world growth in LNG demand over the past decade. From 2010 to 2014, as Japan,  South Korea, China, and India experienced strong growth in demand for LNG, they  sought to supplement contracted volumes with short-term and spot purchases. In  addition, delays in the commissioning of new supply projects also contributed  to the market tightness. Combined demand for short-term LNG from the four  countries nearly tripled, from 2.1 Bcf/d in 2010 to 6.1 Bcf/d in 2014. In Japan  alone, short-term market demand increased by 2.5 Bcf/d, while demand for long-term  contracts increased by only 1.2 Bcf/d (Figure 3-26). </p>

         <p>Note:  LNG imports to Europe are shown as net of re-exports.<br />
Source:  The International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers, <em>The LNG Industry 2010</em> and <em>The LNG Industry 2014</em>, <a href="http://www.giignl.org/publications">http://www.giignl.org/publications</a>.</p>
         <p>While demand for LNG in the Asia Pacific region has  grown over the past 5 years, demand in Europe has declined. European nations  imported a total of 8.7 Bcf/d of LNG in 2010, with short-term demand accounting  for 21% of the total; in 2014, their imports totaled 4.3 Bcf/d. European LNG trade  was characterized by strong growth in re-exports, primarily to Asia. Of the  total volume of short-term LNG purchases imported to Europe in 2014 (1.2  Bcf/d), three-quarters was re-exported to countries in Asia, the Middle East,  and South America. </p>
        
        <p>From  2008 to 2014, 12 countries became LNG importers: 4 in Asia (Thailand,  Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia), 3 in South America (Argentina, Brazil, and  Chile), 3 in the Middle East (Dubai, Kuwait, and Israel), and 2 in Europe (the  Netherlands and Lithuania). Together they accounted for 9% (3 Bcf/d) of the world&rsquo;s  total LNG imports in 2014. Most of those 12 countries are relatively small  markets that opted for floating regasification units (FSRU) as a fast and  cost-effective way to meet growing demand for natural gas. Most of the 12  countries have flexible seasonal demand and procure LNG primarily in the spot  market. In 2014, spot and short-term imports accounted for three-quarters of  their combined total LNG imports. In 2015, four additional countries became LNG  importers [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#78">78</a>],  and three of them&#8212;Egypt, Pakistan, and Jordan&#8212;opted for floating  regasification. In 2016, Colombia and Uruguay are expected to begin LNG imports  using FSRU as receiving terminals.</p>
         <p>Qatar  maintained its position as the world&rsquo;s leading supplier of both spot and  long-term LNG volumes in 2015, and it is expected to hold that spot until the  end of the decade, when both the United States and Australia are expected to  close the gap. However, although Qatar holds abundant reserves of natural gas, its  government has chosen to continue a self-imposed moratorium on development of  its North Field and construction of new LNG export facilities. No new projects  are expected in Qatar until 2020 or later.</p>
<p>Although Malaysia was the world's second-largest  exporter of LNG in 2014, both Australia and the United States are on track to  surpass Malaysia in the near future, with liquefaction projects already under  construction and expected to enter service by 2020. In the IEO2016 Reference  case, global liquefaction capacity in 2019 reaches 57 Bcf/d, a 32% increase  from 2015, led by capacity additions in Australia and the United States that  together account for 93% of the new liquefaction capacity coming online over  the 2015&#8211;19 period (Figure 3-27).</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-27.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-27.png" alt="Figure 3-27. Global LNG capacity additions by country, 2015&#8211;19" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-27_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Australia,  already a significant player in the LNG industry, exported 3.2 Bcf/d of LNG in 2014  and brought the first of its seven new projects&#8212;Queensland Curtis LNG Train 1 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#79">79</a>]&#8212;online  in late 2014 and Train 2 in mid-2015. Six additional projects are under construction and are scheduled  to come online by 2018. With this growth, Australia is expected to overtake  Qatar as the world&rsquo;s leading LNG exporter with 11.5 Bcf/d of liquefaction  capacity by 2019. In the United States, five liquefaction facilities are  currently under construction, and the first export cargo from the Lower 48  states was shipped in February 2016. Several additional projects in the United  States are well into the planning and application process.</p>
<p>The short-term outlook for LNG trade points to a  potential oversupply, as it will take some time for the market to absorb the large  volumes of new LNG supply coming online. In the midterm, new liquefaction  projects on the east coast of Africa (Mozambique, Tanzania) and in western  Canada, and offshore floating liquefaction projects in Malaysia and Australia  will be considered as the LNG market moves beyond its traditional supply  sources. In the long term, the number of LNG exporters and importers is  expected to continue growing as projects move to more remote areas.</p>
</div>
       <h4>OECD natural gas trade</h4>
       <p>In  2012, 23% of the natural gas demand in OECD nations was met by net imports from  non-OECD countries. That share falls to 16% in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference  case, with both imports and exports from different OECD regions shifting  substantially over the projection period. As exports of LNG from the United  States and Australia increase in the first decade of the projection period, total  net imports to the OECD&#8212;predominantly to Europe, Japan, and South Korea&#8212;begin  to decline after 2016. Over the entire period from 2012 to 2040, net imports of  LNG to the OECD fall in the IEO2016 Reference case by 0.4%/year, and net  imports in 2040 are 13% lower than they were in 2012.</p>
       <div class="tie_correction">
         <h4><a name="lng"></a>Liquefied natural gas: Growing use of floating storage and regasification units</h4>
         <p>Floating regasification is a  flexible, cost-effective way for smaller markets to receive and process LNG  shipments. Several countries have turned to floating regasification as a  short-term solution to meet growing demand for natural gas. Three of the four  countries that began importing LNG in 2015&#8212;Pakistan, Jordan, and Egypt&#8212;are  using floating regasification rather than building full-scale onshore  regasification facilities. In addition, the technology is being used in other  countries as a temporary solution while onshore facilities are being built.</p>
<p>Floating regasification  involves the use of a specialized vessel&#8212;a floating storage and regasification  unit (FSRU), which is capable of transporting, storing, and regasifying LNG  onboard&#8212;and either an offshore terminal, which typically includes a buoy and  connecting undersea pipelines to transport regasified LNG to shore, or an  onshore dockside receiving terminal. An FSRU can be either purpose-built or  converted from a conventional LNG vessel. The technology can be developed in  less time than an onshore facility of comparable size. As of 2015, 18 FSRUs were  functioning as both transportation and regasification vessels, and 5  permanently moored regasification units had been converted from conventional  LNG vessels to FSRUs.</p>
<p>The use of floating regasification has grown  rapidly in recent years (Figures 3-28 and 3-29), particularly in emerging  markets facing short-term supply shortages. The technology was first deployed  in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2005. Floating regasification capacity totaled  7.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) at the end of 2014, representing 8% of  global installed regasification capacity, according to data from the  International Gas Union.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-28.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-28.png" alt="Figure 3-28. Floating LNG regasification share of total world regasification capacity, 2006&#8211;16" width="322" /></a><br />

      <span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-29_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      <p>In the spring and fall of 2015,  four more floating terminals came online&#8212;one each in Pakistan and Jordan and  two in Egypt&#8212;adding 1.9 Bcf/d of new capacity [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#80">80</a>].  Seven more floating regasification terminals, totaling 3.1 Bcf/d capacity, are being  developed in Uruguay, Chile, Ghana, India, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico,  and Colombia, with expected online dates in 2016&ndash;17. When those terminals are  completed, global regasification capacity will total 12.7 Bcf/d.</p>
<p>Floating regasification is likely to remain a  preferred technology option for emerging markets because of its flexible  deployment capabilities, smaller capacities, quick startup, and relatively low  costs as compared with the costs of onshore terminals.</p>
       </div>
       <h4>OECD Americas</h4>
<p>With the exception of Mexico, regional net  imports among the nations of the OECD Americas trend downward through 2040 in  the IEO2016 Reference case (Figure 3-30). In the United States, rising domestic  production reduces the need for imports, primarily as a result of robust growth  in regional production of shale gas. The United States becomes a net
exporter  of natural gas in 2017, with net exports growing to 5.6 Tcf in 2040. Most of  the growth in U.S. net exports can be attributed to exports of LNG globally,  although U.S. pipeline exports to Mexico also grow steadily as increasing  volumes of natural gas for Mexico imported from the United States fill the  growing gap between production and consumption in Mexico. In 2012, U.S. exports  to Mexico totaled 620 billion cubic feet. In the IEO2016 Reference case,  Mexico&rsquo;s net natural gas imports more than double, to 1.3 Tcf in 2040, after  reaching their highest level in the mid-2020s. Beyond 2025, increases in Mexico&rsquo;s  natural gas production slow the country's demand for imports (<a href="nat_gas.cfm.html#nge"><em>see &quot;U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico,&quot;</em></a>). U.S. domestically sourced exports of LNG (excluding exports from  the existing Kenai facility in Alaska) begin in 2016 and grow to 3.4 Tcf in  2030, with more than three-quarters originating in the Lower 48 states and the  remainder in Alaska.

<div class="tie_correction">
  <h4><a name="nge"></a>U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico</h4>
  <p>With new U.S. pipeline export  capacity being brought online, and connecting pipelines in Mexico ramping up to  full capacity, exports of natural gas by pipeline from the United States are  beginning to gradually displace Mexico&rsquo;s imports of LNG. According to EIA data,  U.S. pipeline exports to Mexico set a monthly record high average of 3.3  billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in July 2015, and over the first seven  months of 2015 they averaged 2.7 Bcf/d&#8212;35% higher than the total for the first  seven months of 2014. Mexico&rsquo;s LNG imports declined in the first seven months  of 2015, according to data from the SecretarÃ­a de EconomÃ­a. Before the boom in  U.S. shale gas production, Mexico had expected only limited growth in pipeline  imports from the United States. However, with the rise of U.S. shale production  and the decline in natural gas prices, Mexico&rsquo;s need for LNG imports has  fallen, and its LNG regasification terminals have been operating below  capacity.</p>
<p>Currently, Mexico has three  regasification terminals: Altamira, on the east coast, commissioned in 2006,  with 0.7 Bcf/d capacity; Ensenada (also called Energia Costa Azul) on the west  coast in operation since 2008 with 1.0 Bcf/d capacity; and Manzanillo on the  west coast commissioned in 2012 with 0.5 Bcf/d capacity. While use at the  Manzanillo terminal has been relatively high, averaging 85% in 2013&ndash;14, utilization  at the Altamira terminal averaged around 50%, and the Costa Azul terminal in  the Baja Peninsula was virtually unused.</p>
<p>LNG imports at the Manzanillo terminal provide  natural gas for the gas-fired power plants in Mexico's Central West region. The  location of the Manzanillo terminal provides a unique point of entry and serves  to relieve pipeline bottlenecks  in the region. As a result, LNG imports to the terminal are expected to remain  high over the next few years, until additional pipeline capacity is developed  to provide alternative sources.
<p>Imports at the Energia Costa Azul terminal, on the other hand, have averaged only 4% of the terminal's nameplate capacity since 2011, despite a long-term contract with the Tangguh liquefaction project in Indonesia. Originally, the terminal was constructed to supply the Southern California market and new power plants in Mexico's state of Baja California. However, those plants also could be supplied via U.S. pipelines, and the terminal depended mostly on natural gas demand in California, which was limited by the availability of less costly U.S. supplies. Because the Costa Azul contract allowed for diversion of supply volumes to other markets, most of contracted supply from Indonesia has gone instead to higher priced Asian markets over the past several years. Sempra Energy, the terminalâ€™s operator, is considering a conversion of the terminal to a liquefaction facility.</p>
<p>At the Altamira terminal, LNG imports in 2008&#8211;15 have consistently averaged about 50% of the terminal's capacity. Terminal operators Shell and Total have a supply contract with Mexico's Comisi&oacute;n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), which allows them to supply CFE with either pipeline natural gas or LNG. However, the contract stipulates that at least 50% of the supply must be LNG. In the first six months of 2015, imports to the Altamira terminal declined by 14% from the same period a year earlier, as increasing availability of pipeline gas from the United States at lower prices displaced some of the LNG imports. In September 2015, CFE canceled a tender for several spot cargos into Altamira between September and December, noting the increased availability of less-expensive pipeline natural gas from the United States. The Manzanillo terminal may follow suit in the coming years as additional pipeline infrastructure becomes available in the region to alleviate the existing bottlenecks.</p>


</div>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, pipeline exports of natural  gas from Canada to the United States continue declining as U.S. shale gas  production grows. However, Canada remains a net exporter of natural gas, with  LNG export volumes replacing some of the lost pipeline export volumes. Canada&rsquo;s  net exports of natural gas in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case are 22% higher  than they were in 2012.</p>
<h3>OECD Europe</h3>
<p>In OECD Europe, total natural gas imports continue to grow  by an average of 2.1%/year from 2012 to 2040 as local production sources  decline, especially in the United Kingdom. The pipeline share of OECD Europe's  natural gas imports grows in the IEO2016 Reference case to between 40% and 50%  of the region&rsquo;s total natural gas supply, and its LNG imports grow to about 20%  of the region&rsquo;s total natural gas supply in 2040.</p>
<h3>OECD Asia</h3>
<p>The world's two largest importers of LNG are  Japan and South Korea in the OECD Asia region. The Australia/New Zealand  country grouping, also in OECD Asia, is becoming the world&rsquo;s second-largest  exporter of LNG (after Qatar). Supported by a fivefold increase in Australia&rsquo;s  exports from 2012 to 2040, OECD Asia&rsquo;s net demand for imports falls from 5.3  Tcf in 2012 to 5.0 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-31).</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-31.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-31.png" alt="Figure 3-31. OECD Asia net natural gas trade, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br />

<p>Japan and South Korea continue to be major players in world  LNG trade, even though their total consumption of natural gas is relatively small  on a global scale. Although their combined natural gas consumption represented  slightly more than 5% of world consumption in 2012, it represented almost 50%  of world LNG imports. Because the two countries are almost entirely dependent  on LNG imports for natural gas supplies, their overall consumption patterns  translate directly to import requirements. South Korea&rsquo;s imports grow  moderately in the IEO2016 Reference case, in line with the country&rsquo;s growth in  natural gas demand.</p>
<p>Japan has experienced dramatic growth in LNG imports since  the Fukushima nuclear disaster in early 2011, with total LNG imports in 2012  approximately 25% higher than in 2010. Beginning in 2015, there has been a  gradual restart of Japan&rsquo;s nuclear capacity, and in the IEO2016 Reference case,  those gradual restarts are assumed to continue and to lessen the country&rsquo;s need  for LNG imports. When nuclear power generators are able to provide about 15% of  Japan&rsquo;s total generation, the country&rsquo;s natural gas import demand is expected  to return to the slow growth trend anticipated before the Fukushima event,  based on relatively slow economic growth and declining population.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD natural gas trade</h4>
<p>Net exports of natural gas from non-OECD countries decline  by less than 1.0%/year on average in the IEO2016 Reference case. As with the  OECD countries, the relatively small decline for the region in aggregate  obscures changes in the trading patterns of the separate non-OECD regions and  countries.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia</h4>
<p>Net exports of natural gas from Russia, the  largest exporter in the world, represent the most significant factor in exports  from non-OECD Europe and Eurasia, which grow in the IEO2016 Reference case by an  average of 3.7%/year, from 5.4 Tcf in 2012 to 6.5 Tcf in 2020 and 15.0 Tcf in  2040 (Figure 3-32). With Russia providing the largest incremental volume of  exports to meet the increase in demand for supplies from non-OECD Europe and  Eurasia, its net exports grow by an average of 3.4%/year, from 6.1 Tcf in 2012  to 15.6 Tcf in 2040. LNG and pipeline exports from Russia to customers in both  Europe and Asia increase throughout the projection, while exports from Central  Asia increase by an average of 0.3%/year.</p>

<h4>Middle East</h4>
<p>Net exports of natural gas from the Middle East grow by an average  of 1.7%/year, as flows from the region increase from 4.4 Tcf in 2012 to 7.2 Tcf  in 2040 (Figure 3-33). An important factor in the increase is the growth of LNG  supplies from Qatar after 2025. Qatar's natural gas exports grow by an average  of 1.2%/year from 2010 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case. With the current  moratorium on further development of Qatar's North Field, no new LNG projects  are being initiated. Qatar enacted the moratorium in 2005 to assess the effect  of ongoing increases in production on the North Field before committing to  further increases.</p>

<p>Iran is another Middle Eastern country that is  expected to increase its natural gas exports over the projection period. Net  natural gas exports from Iran grow from 0.1 Tcf in 2012 to 2.0 Tcf in 2040  according to the IEO2016 Reference case. International sanctions against Iran's  oil and natural gas sectors have been eased as a result of the Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement reached between Iran, the P5+1  (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany),  and the European Union (EU). The JCPOA agreement has the potential to increase  Iran's natural gas exports (both by pipeline and, in the longer term, LNG)  beyond the amount projected in the IEO2016 Reference case (<a href="nat_gas.cfm.html#natgasexports"><em>see also &quot;Potential for increased natural gas exports from Iran  following the end of international sanctions,&quot;</em></a>).</p>
<div class="tie_correction">
  <h4><a name="natgasexports" id="natgasexports"></a>Potential for increased natural gas exports from Iran following the end of international sanctions</h4>
  <p>After  Russia, Iran has the second-largest proved reserves of natural gas in the world  [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#81">81</a>],  and it has a strong potential to develop those resources at a faster pace after  the recent lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. Iran is targeting a substantial  increase in natural gas production in the coming years, not only to meet  rapidly growing domestic demand, but also to boost its export capacity,  primarily by pipeline. In the longer term, Iran plans to build LNG export  facilities for global shipments of natural gas. </p>
  
  <p>Additional  production of natural gas for export markets will compete with Iran's domestic  demand for natural gas, which is used both for reinjection in the production of  oil and as a feedstock in the country's rapidly growing domestic petrochemical  industry. According to estimates by the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC),  more than $100 billion in investment capital will be needed to rebuild Iran&rsquo;s natural  gas industry.</p>
  <p>Iran  is currently the fourth-largest natural gas consumer in the world after the  United States, Russia, and China, with total consumption of 15.4 Bcf/d in 2014 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#82">82</a>]  and 16.6 Bcf/d in the first 6 months of 2015. From 2005 to 2014, Iran's  domestic consumption of natural gas grew by 66%, second only to the rate of  increase in China [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#83">83</a>].In  2014, Iran&rsquo;s natural gas production and consumption were closely matched, with  net exports of 0.1 Bcf/d. In 2014, the residential, commercial, and public  sectors and small industries accounted for 55% (8.4 Bcf/d) of Iran&rsquo;s total  natural gas consumption. Power plants and large industries accounted for 45%  (7.0 Bcf/d) of Iran&rsquo;s total natural gas consumption in 2014. According to  NIGC&rsquo;s Strategic Objectives document, Iran plans to increase the natural gas  share of its domestic energy mix and more than double its natural gas  processing capacity, from approximately 20 Bcf/d in 2014 to 42 Bcf/d by 2025 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#84">84</a>],  while reducing its consumption of fuel oil in power generation and replacing  its aging oil-fired plants with new natural gas-fired plants.</p>
  <p>NIGC  estimates that to meet the rapidly growing domestic demand for natural gas,  Iran will need more than $20 billion in investment to upgrade and expand its  domestic pipeline infrastructure. Iran plans to expand the domestic pipeline  network to more than 35 Bcf/d by 2017, adding 1,709 miles (2,750 km) of new  pipelines at a cost of $6.3 billion and investing more than $15 billion in  expansion and upgrades of the existing domestic pipeline network. Those expansions  are likely to require foreign capital, and to attract foreign investors Iran  has proposed various investment schemes, including <em>build-operate-own-transfer</em>. Some foreign investors may be reluctant  to proceed at this point because of concerns about corruption, red tape, and  state influence over the economy. Consequently, it may take some time for the  expansion plans to materialize.</p>
<p>Iran  has increased its domestic natural gas production fivefold over the past 20  years. Most of its natural gas production comes from the South Pars field, the  largest natural gas field in the world, which Iran shares with Qatar. On  Qatar&rsquo;s side, the field is called the <em>North  Field</em>. Iran is developing 28 phases in South Pars, 10 of which are  operational [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#85">85</a>].  Phase 12 began production in early 2015 (3 Bcf/d of natural gas and 120,000 b/d  of condensate). Production from phases 15 and 16 began at the end of 2015 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#86">86</a>].  Between 2015 and 2020, Iran has the potential to add between 8 Bcf/d and 9  Bcf/d of new natural gas production, primarily from South Pars. The Kish field,  the largest nonshared natural gas field in the country, is being developed.  Kish has a production target of 0.9 Bcf/d of natural gas and 4 million barrels  of gas condensate [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#87">87</a>]  per year, and $1.4 billion has been allocated for its development. In addition,  after 2020, Iran plans to develop its North Pars, Golshan, and Ferdowsi natural  gas fields.</p>
<p>In  2014, 93% of Iran&rsquo;s pipeline exports (0.9 Bcf/d) went to Turkey, and 0.03 Bcf/d  went to Armenia and Azerbaijan (net of imports from Azerbaijan). Iran imported  0.7 Bcf/d from Turkmenistan in 2014, or half of its contractual volumes, as Iran&rsquo;s  growing production allowed it to become more self-sufficient in delivering natural  gas to its major consumption centers in the northern part of the country. The price  of Iran&rsquo;s natural gas exports to Turkey is one of the highest in the region,  and it has been used as a benchmark for Iran's other proposed pipeline export  projects. However, the reluctance of Persian Gulf countries to sign contracts  at those prices has been the main obstacle to Iran's development of new pipeline  export projects. Future contracts for exports to Gulf countries are likely to  require some reduction in the prices of Iranian natural gas exports.</p>
<p>Iran's  Sixth Development Plan, which outlines its economic development goals for the  next five years, sets a target to increase natural gas exports to more than 6  Bcf/d by March 2021. The target is based on expanding production primarily from  the South Pars field, which can be exported by pipeline to Iran's neighboring  countries. In the plan, Iran has prioritized pipeline exports over LNG exports,  with a potential total of 3 Bcf/d to 4 Bcf/d in the next several years coming from  projects that are close to completion. The focus of Iran&rsquo;s export pipelines is  on neighboring Persian Gulf countries, Pakistan, potentially India, and in the  longer term, exports to European countries via Turkey.</p>
<p>Exports of natural gas from Iran to the Persian Gulf  countries&#8212;particularly, Iraq, Oman, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)&#8212;are  likely to begin by 2017â€“18 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#88">88</a>].There  also are plans for Iran to increase exports to Iraq by 0.9 Bcf/d,
to  a total of 1.6 Bcf/d, but the duration of that export contract is expected to  be short, because Iraq&rsquo;s domestic production increases in the mid-2020s. Iran  is also planning pipeline exports to Oman (0.7 Bcf/d to 1.0 Bcf/d via a  proposed 109-mile subsea pipeline); to Kuwait (0.3 Bcf/d to 0.5 Bcf/d); and to the  UAE (0.6 Bcf/d to 1.5 Bcf/d). The existing pipeline network connecting Iran&rsquo;s  Salman field to the Sharjah Emirate of the UAE can deliver 0.6 Bcf/d, but a  dispute over the contract price has delayed gas shipments and is currently in international  arbitration. If the pricing issue is resolved between parties, Iran can start  exports to the UAE quickly.</p>
<p>Proposed  projects to export natural gas by pipeline from Iran to countries outside the Persian  Gulf involve considerable risk for a variety of reasons. The proposed projects  include:
<ul>
  <li>Pakistan plans to link the Iranian pipeline with  a proposed $45 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Iran has built all but  the final 155 miles on its side, and China is building a 435-mile stretch  inside Pakistan that would move natural gas from Gwadar port in the West to  Nawabshah in the South. The project requires building a short 50-mile leg to  Gwadar from the border with Iran, which is likely to be financed by China.  Risks include terrorist threats in Pakistan&rsquo;s Balochistan province, an enclave  of Pakistani insurgents, and contract pricing that has not been finalized.</li>
  <li>Iran is in discussions to revive the Iran-Pakistan-India  Peace Pipeline project, which may be a longer-term development. India has  proposed to develop Iran's 12.8 Tcf Farzad-B natural gas field and is  considering construction of subsea pipeline to link Iran directly with India.  However, at an estimated cost of about $5 billion, the project is both expensive  and technologically challenging.</li>
  <li>Iran also is considering exports to Europe via  Turkey. An estimated $5.1 billion investment would be required to expand a  1,120-mile, 56-inch-diameter pipeline that would connect Assaluyeh with  Bazargan near the Turkish border.</li>
</ul>
<p>LNG exports from Iran may be a longer-term  development. Iran will face strong competition, and its projects may not be  economically viable in the current environment of low oil prices. Among the  projects that have been proposed, the Iran LNG project (capacity 1.4 Bcf/d) may  be the most likely to materialize after 2020. Iran has already spent $2.5  billion to build LNG port facilities, tank storage, and other infrastructure  for the project and can now gain access to liquefaction technology not  available when sanctions were in place. NIGC's announced target of increasing  its natural gas liquefaction capacity to 10% of the world total by 2025 is not likely  to be met [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#89">89</a>].  However, some smaller projects&#8212;including delivering natural gas via pipeline to  Oman to use spare capacity in the Qalhat LNG liquefaction project, and use of  Das Island liquefaction facility in Abu Dhabi&#8212;are more likely to be developed  in the next few years.</p>
</div>
<p>Elsewhere  in the Middle East, Yemen, Oman, and Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates  (UAE) also are current exporters of LNG. However, the potential for growth in their  exports and exports from other countries in the Middle East appears to be  limited by their need to meet increases in their own domestic demand. The  IEO2016 Reference case shows a similar trend for smaller producers in the  Arabian Peninsula as a whole, including Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, and Yemen. As a  group, they exported about 0.2 Tcf of natural gas on a net basis in 2012, and  the volume of their net imports rises to a total of 1.2 Tcf in 2040.</p>
<h4>Africa</h4>
<p>Net exports of natural gas from Africa increase  in the IEO2016 Reference case by an average of 1.7%/year (Figure 3-34). In  2012, the region&rsquo;s net exports totaled about 3.4 Tcf, with 2.3 Tcf coming from  North Africa. Net exports from West Africa grow at a robust average annual rate  of 6.5% from 2012 to 2040, with much of the growth coming in the later part of  the projection. Security concerns and uncertainty over terms of access in  Nigeria have significantly delayed any progress on currently proposed LNG  export projects.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-34.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-34.png" alt="Figure 3-34. Africa net natural gas trade, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
<span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-34_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Persistent,  significant above-ground challenges in East Africa hamper export growth in that  region. This is primarily owing to production and export proposals representing  a large change in scale of operations for the oil and natural gas industries in  Mozambique and Tanzania, where physical and regulatory infrastructures are not  yet in place to support large-scale production and export of natural gas (<em>see &quot;<a href="nat_gas.cfm.html#natgasexports">Potential for increased natural gas  exports from Iran following the end of international sanctions,</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="nat_gas.cfm.html#lng">Liquefied  natural gas: Growing use of floating storage and regasification units,</a>&quot;</em>).</p>
<h3>Non-OECD Asia</h3>
<p>Non-OECD Asia has the highest regional growth  rate in net imports of natural gas in the IEO2016 Reference case. With net  imports of 17.5 Tcf in 2040, non-OECD Asia becomes the world&rsquo;s largest  importing region, surpassing OECD Europe by 2040. China has the largest  increase in import demand, to 8.9 Tcf/year in 2040, when nearly one-third of  its annual natural gas consumption is supplied by imports (Figure 3-35).</p>

<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-35.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-35.png" alt="Figure 3-35. Non-OECD Asia net natural gas trade, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
<span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-35_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>To meet future demand, China is actively pursuing multiple  potential sources for natural gas imports. Chinese companies have signed  long-term agreements to deliver at least 6.6 Bcf/d through 2030 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#90">90</a>].Most  of those contracts are with Asian firms sourcing LNG from Australia, Indonesia,  Malaysia, Qatar, and Papua New Guinea. Moreover, there are additional contracts  tied to new liquefaction projects located in Australia, Russia, and the United  States that are scheduled to come online by 2020.</p>
<p>China is also pursuing multiple sources for pipeline natural  gas imports, which have increased as production from Central Asia and Myanmar has  grown and the non-OECD region's natural gas infrastructure has improved. China&rsquo;s  total pipeline imports of natural gas exceeded its LNG imports in 2012, and in  2014 its LNG imports totaled 1.1 Tcf, up by 20% from 2013 LNG imports [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#91">91</a>].  China's first natural gas import pipeline, which was completed in late 2009,  now transports supplies from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Another pipeline from  Myanmar was completed in 2013, with the capacity to carry 0.4 Tcf/year of  natural gas from Myanmar's offshore fields in the Bay of Bengal to Kunming in  China's Yunnan province [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#92">92</a>].  China also began importing natural gas from Kazakhstan in July 2013, but the  quantities have been very small, constituting about 1% of the total pipeline  imports into China in 2015.</p>
<p>In addition, Russia and China signed a significant  natural gas agreement in May 2014. The deal was signed after a decade of  negotiations over the import price and the supply route [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#93">93</a>],  with China agreeing to purchase 1.3 Tcf of natural gas per year from Gazprom's  East Siberian fields at a total cost of $400 billion over a 30-year period. The  proposed Power of Siberia pipeline will connect Russia's eastern Siberian natural  gas fields and Sakhalin Island to northeastern China. China's National  Development and Reform Commission, which approved construction of the pipeline  on the Chinese side in late 2014, anticipates that it will come online in 2018.  In November 2014, Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Commission also  signed a memorandum of understanding for China to import 1.1 Tcf/year from  Russia's western Siberian natural gas fields, although many key  details, including pricing details and required infrastructure expansion plans,  have not yet been addressed [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#94">94</a>].</p>
<p>India has also increased its natural gas imports. Since  2013, unexpected production declines in India&rsquo;s Krishna Godavari basin have meant  that the country must rely more heavily on LNG imports. As a result, Indian  companies have invested in increasing the country&rsquo;s LNG regasification capacity  in recent years to meet rising demand. In early 2013, GAIL (India&rsquo;s largest  state-owned natural gas processing and distribution company), NTPC (India&rsquo;s  largest power utility), and several other smaller players restarted the Dabhol  project (originally proposed by the now-defunct Enron Corporation), which  includes a regasification terminal to fuel three natural gas-fired power  stations [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#95">95</a>].  Dabhol LNG also ships natural gas to southern India through the new pipeline to  Bengaluru. GAIL is installing a breakwater facility to double Dabhol&rsquo;s capacity  by 2017. Petronet&rsquo;s LNG terminal at Kochi, commissioned in late 2013, is  experiencing low utilization as a result of delays in the approval and  construction of a proposed pipeline to Mangalore and other parts of southern  India, according to IHS. India&rsquo;s natural gas imports grow in the IEO2016  Reference case by an average of 6.7%/year, to a total of 3.9 Tcf in 2040.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Americas</h4>
<p>Natural gas trade in the non-OECD Americas region  has become increasingly globalized as several countries have become involved in  the LNG trade. In the IEO2016 Reference case, new LNG regasification capacity  facilitates growth in the region&rsquo;s gross imports of natural gas through 2040,  but the discovery of large new natural gas reserves throughout the region  increases its gross exports by a larger amount. As a result, the region&rsquo;s  overall trade balance remains relatively flat, with net exports increasing from  0.6 Tcf in 2012 to 0.7 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-36), after declining in the middle  years of the projection.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-36.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-36.png" alt="Figure 3-36. Non-OECD Americas net natural gas trade, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
<span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-36_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Although  LNG regasification facilities in Brazil and in the Southern Cone (excluding  Chile, an OECD member state since 2010) have received LNG supplies fairly  consistently over the past three years, the Southern Cone becomes a net exporter  of natural gas by 2030 in the IEO2016 Reference case, largely as a result of the  discovery of substantial shale gas reserves in Argentina&rsquo;s northwestern Neuqu&eacute;n  province [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#96">96</a>].  Net imports to Brazil remain essentially flat from 2012 through 2040. Overall  net exports from the Andean region end in 2030 and net exports from the  Northern Producers increase by an average of 0.5%/year from 2012 to 2040. </p>
<h2>World natural gas reserves</h2>
<p>As reported by <em>Oil &amp; Gas Journal</em> [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#97">97</a>],  the world&rsquo;s proved natural gas reserves have grown by about 40% over the past  20 years, to a total of 6,950 Tcf as of January 1, 2016 (Figure 3-37). Estimated  proved reserves in the non-OECD region as a whole have grown by 43% (1,912 Tcf)  since 1996, while proved reserves in the OECD region have grown by 21% (104 Tcf)  since 1996. As a result, the share of world proved natural gas reserves located  in OECD countries has declined from 10% in 1996 to 9% in 2016.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-37.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-37.png" alt="Figure 3-37. World proved natural gas reserves by region, 1980&#8211;2016" width="322" /></a><br /> 
<span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-37_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>The annual rate of growth in world proved natural gas  reserves from 1980 to 1995 was notably higher than it has been in more recent  years. Since 1995, the annual growth rate, while variable, has slowed to a  reasonably steady rate of about 1.6%/year. Over the past 10 years, estimates of  proved world natural gas reserves rose by 838 Tcf, or an average of 1.3%/year,  as compared with 1,179 Tcf, or 2.2%/year on average over the previous 10 years  (from 1996 to 2006). Estimated proved reserves in the non-OECD countries rose  by 723 Tcf, or an average of 1.2% annually, over the past 10 years, compared  with 2.4% annually from 1996 to 2006. The most rapid annual increase in non-OECD  proved reserves in this period, at 12%/year, occurred from 2003 to 2004,  supported by an increase in Qatar from 509 Tcf to 910 Tcf. In comparison,  proved reserves in the OECD countries declined by 0.2%/year from 1996 to 2006  and increased by 115 Tcf, or an average of 2.1%/year, over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>World proved natural gas reserves generally have  grown in each year since 1980, but declines have been reported for four years  (1995, 1996, 2005, and 2015). Although world reserves increased by a modest  0.4% from 2015 to 2016, that increase follows a decrease of 1.5% (105 Tcf) from  2014 to 2015, and the estimate for 2016 still is lower than the 2014 level. Estimates of proved reserves in both the OECD and  non-OECD regions show a similar trajectory; however, the absolute decrease in  2015 and the increase in 2016 were greater in the OECD countries, even though  their reserve levels are less than one-tenth the levels in the non-OECD countries.  Accordingly, the percentage decrease from 2014 to 2015 was 9.0% for the OECD  countries, compared to 0.7% for the non-OECD countries, and the increase from  2015 to 2016 was 2.9% for the OECD countries, compared to 0.2% for the non-OECD  countries.</p>
<p>Estimates of world proved reserves increased by 31 Tcf from  2015 to 2016, with more than one-half of the increase (17 Tcf) coming from OECD  countries. From 2015 to 2016, proved reserves in the OECD Americas rose by 29  Tcf, proved reserves in OECD Europe fell by 11 Tcf, and proved reserves in the  countries of OECD Asia were nearly flat. Estimated proved reserves in the  non-OECD countries increased by 13 Tcf from 2015 to 2016, with a combined 17  Tcf of additional proved reserves in China, Malaysia, India, and Angola  partially offset by a decrease of 2 Tcf in Indonesia&rsquo;s proved reserves.</p>
<p>The largest change in proved natural gas reserve estimates  was for the United States, where estimated proved natural gas reserves  increased by 30 Tcf (9%), from 338 Tcf in 2015 to 369 Tcf in 2016. The  second-largest change was for China, where estimated proved reserves increased  by 11 Tcf (7%), from 164 Tcf in 2015 to 175 Tcf in 2016. As a result, China&rsquo;s  estimated proved reserves are now the world&rsquo;s 10th largest, up from the 11th largest  in 2015. The third-largest change in estimated proved reserves was for Saudi  Arabia, with estimated reserve additions of 6 Tcf (2%), from 294 Tcf in 2015 to  300 Tcf in 2016. Although there were no changes in proved reserves for Russia  and Iran, their proved reserves are ranked first and second in the world at  1,688 Tcf and 1,201 Tcf, respectively. Qatar and the United States are ranked  third and fourth, at 866 Tcf (down 1%) and 369 Tcf (up 9%), respectively.</p>
<p>Current estimates of proved natural gas reserves worldwide  indicate a large resource base to support growth in markets through 2040 and  beyond. Like reserves for other fossil fuels, natural gas reserves are spread  unevenly around the world. Natural gas proved reserves are concentrated in  Eurasia and in the Middle East, where ratios of proved reserves to production  suggest decades of resource availability. However, in the OECD countries,  including many in which there are relatively high levels of consumption,  current ratios of proved reserves to production are significantly lower. The  impact of that disparity is reflected in the IEO2016 projections of increased  international trade in natural gas.</p>
  
<p>Almost three-quarters of the world&rsquo;s proved  natural gas reserves are located in the Middle East and Eurasia (Figure 3-38),  with Russia, Iran, and Qatar together accounting for about 54% of world proved  natural gas reserves as of January 1, 2016 (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/table3-2.cfm">Table 3-2</a>). Proved reserves in the  rest of the world's regions are distributed fairly evenly. Despite high rates  of increase in natural gas consumption, particularly over the past decade, most  regional reserves-to-production ratios have remained high. Worldwide, the  reserves-to-production ratio is estimated at 54 years. Central and South  America has a reserves-to-production ratio of 44 years, Russia 56 years, and  Africa 70 years. In contrast, the Middle East&rsquo;s reserves-to-production ratio  exceeds 100 years [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#98">98</a>].The  United States has a reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio of 13 years [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#99">99</a>].</p>

<p>Proved  reserves include only estimated quantities of natural gas that can be produced  economically from known reservoirs, and therefore they are only a subset of the  entire potential natural gas resource base. Resource base estimates include  estimated quantities of both discovered and undiscovered natural gas that have  the potential to be classified as reserves at some time in the future. In the IEO2016  Reference case, the resource base does not pose a constraint on global natural  gas supply. By basing long-term production assessments on resources rather than  reserves, EIA is able to present projections that are physically achievable and  can be supported beyond the 2040 projection horizon. The realization of such  production levels depends on future growth in world demand, taking into  consideration such above-ground limitations on production as profitability and  specific national regulations, among others.      </p>
