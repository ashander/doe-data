        <div align="right"><a class="ico_pdf" href="pdf/world.pdf"> print version</a></div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The <em>International  Energy Outlook 2016</em> (IEO2016) Reference case projects significant growth in  worldwide energy demand over the 28-year period from 2012 to 2040. Total world  consumption of marketed energy expands from 549 quadrillion British thermal  units (Btu) in 2012 to 629 quadrillion Btu in 2020 and to 815 quadrillion Btu  in 2040&mdash;a 48% increase from 2012 to 2040 (<a href="table1-1.cfm.html">Table 1-1</a> and Figure 1-1). The  IEO2016 Reference case assumes known technologies and technological and  demographic trends, generally reflects the effects of current policies, and  does not anticipate new policies that have not been announced (<a href="world.cfm.html#uspolicies">See EIA's handling of non-policies in the <em>International Energy Outlook</em>)</a>.</p>

<p><span><a href="images/figure_1-1.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-1.png" alt="Figure 12. World total energy consumption, 1990-2040." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span>        </p>
        
<p>The IEO2016 Reference case projections do not  include the effects of the recently finalized Clean Power Plan (CPP)  regulations in the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's  (EIA) preliminary analysis of the proposed CPP [<a href="world.cfm.html#footnotes.cfm#9">9</a>]  shows potential reductions of 21% (about 4 quadrillion Btu) in U.S. coal  consumption in 2020 and 24% (almost 5 quadrillion Btu) in 2040 relative to the  IEO2016 Reference case projection. With the CPP, U.S. renewable energy use in  2020 would be 7% (about 1 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case,  and in 2040 it would be 37% (4 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference  case. U.S. consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels and of natural gas  would be slightly lower with the CPP than in the Reference case.</p>


<div class="tie_correction">
        <h4><a name="uspolicies">EIA&rsquo;s handling  of non-U.S. policies in the <em>International  Energy Outlook</em></a></h4>
    <p>The <em>International Energy Outlook</em> (IEO), in general, reflects the effects  of current policies&#8212;often stated through regulationsâ€”within the projections. The  IEO does not incorporate policies that are not currently in place. Within the  context of international modeling, incorporating existing policies and  regulations and interpreting announced country targets can be complex. EIA  analysts consider policies, regulations, and targets in major countries and  regions within the 16 IEO regions with the goal of realistically incorporating  them into the projections.</p>
     <p>The incorporation of U.S.  policies in IEO2016 is consistent with their incorporation in the <em>Annual Energy Outlook 2015</em> (AEO2015). The  final Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule, which was issued in August 2015, is not  included in the AEO2015 or IEO2016 Reference cases. However, the impact is  addressed in key tables, figures, and discussions in IEO2016, based on EIA&rsquo;s  analysis of the proposed version of the CPP rule, which was issued earlier. The <em>Annual Energy Outlook 2016</em> (AEO2016)  Reference case will include the final CPP rule.</p>
      <p>For policies outside the  United States, EIA analysts assess the prospects that countries or country groups  (for example, the European Union) will be able to achieve the goals or targets  stated or implied in their policies. Analysts may consider the track record of  countries or country groupings in meeting goals of current or past policies as  an indicator of their likely success in meeting future policy targets. For  example, the European Union&rsquo;s 20-20-20 plan is fully incorporated in EIA&rsquo;s  projections for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  Europe. On the other hand, Ukraine&rsquo;s 2012 strategic goal for planned nuclear  capacity additions is not fully implemented in the projections given that  country&rsquo;s poor track record.</p>
<p>EIA attempts to be transparent about the extent  to which international government policies, regulations, targets, and other  statements are incorporated in the IEO projections. Where major policies have  not been fully implemented in the analysis, explanations are provided for the  rationale of the approaches that are used.</p>
    </div>
        
        <p>Much  of the world increase in energy demand occurs among the developing non-OECD nations  (outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#10">10</a>],  where strong economic growth and expanding populations  lead the increase in world energy use. Non-OECD demand for energy rises by 71% from  2012 to 2040. In contrast, in the more mature energy-consuming and  slower-growing OECD economies, total energy use rises by only 18% from 2012 to 2040  (Figure 1-2)..</p>
    <p><span><a href="images/figure_1-2.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-2.png" alt="Figure 1-2. World energy consumption by region, 1990â€“2040 ." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-2_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p> <p>Economic  growth, along with accompanying structural changes, strongly influences world  energy consumption. As countries develop and living standards improve, energy  demand grows rapidly. For instance, in nations experiencing fast-paced economic  growth, the share of the populace demanding improved housingâ€”which requires  more energy to construct and maintainâ€”often increases. Increased demand for  appliances and transportation equipment, and growing capacity to produce goods  and services for both domestic and foreign markets, also lead to higher energy  consumption. Over the past 30 years, world economic growth has been led by the  non-OECD countries, accompanied by strong growth in energy demand in the  region. From 1990 to 2012, real GDP grew by 4.9%/year in non-OECD countries,  compared with 2.1%/year in OECD countries. In the future, the differences in  economic growth rates between OECD and non-OECD nations are expected to narrow,  as economic growth in non-OECD countries moderates, and as their industrial  structures move from reliance mainly on production in energy-intensive  industries to more service-oriented industries. In the IEO2016 Reference case,  average GDP in the non-OECD region grows by 4.2%/year from 2012 to 2040,  compared with 2.0%/year in the OECD (Figure 1-3).</p>
 <p><span><a href="images/figure_1-3.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-3.png" alt="Figure 1-3. World total gross domestic product, 1990â€“2040." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-3_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
 <p>On a worldwide basis, real gross domestic product (GDP, measured  in purchasing power parity terms) grows in the IEO2016 Reference case by an  average of 3.3%/year from 2012 to 2040&#8212;with non-OECD GDP growth averaging 4.2%/year  and OECD GDP growth averaging 2.0%/year. Accordingly, energy consumption growth  is led by non-OECD demand. Non-OECD energy consumption first surpassed the OECD  total in 2007; in 2040, total energy demand in the non-OECD region exceeds the  OECD total by 89%.</p>
 <p>   More than half of the projected increase in global energy  consumption from 2012 to 2040 occurs among the nations of non-OECD Asia, a  country grouping that includes China and India. In the Reference case, energy demand  in non-OECD Asia by 83% (or, by 146 quadrillion Btu) from 2012 to 2040. China  and India, in particular, have been among the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing economies  over much of the past decade. Although their rates of economic expansion are  expected to moderate in the future, they remain important areas of growth in  world energy demand throughout the 2012&#8211;40 period.</p>
<p>In addition to energy demand growth in non-OECD  Asia, other non-OECD regions show substantial increases in energy demand in the  IEO2016 Reference case (Figure 1-4). Fast-paced growth in population and access  to ample domestic resources result in a total increase of 95% (30 quadrillion  Btu) in the Middle East region&rsquo;s energy consumption from 2012 and 2040.  Similarly, Africa&rsquo;s energy consumption more than doubles (a total increase of 22  quadrillion Btu), and energy use in the non-OECD Americas region grows by 53%  (16 quadrillion Btu). The smallest total increase in energy demand in the  Reference case from 2012 to 2040 among non-OECD regions is 14% for non-OECD  Europe and Eurasia, including Russia, as the region&rsquo;s population declines and significant  gains in energy efficiency are achieved by replacing old, Soviet-era capital  equipment with more efficient stock.</p>
        <p><span><a href="images/figure_1-4.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-4.png" alt="Figure 1-4. Non-OECD energy consumption by region, 1990â€“2040." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-4_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        <h2>Outlook for world energy consumption by source</h2>
        <p>Consumption  of energy from all sources increases in the IEO2016 Reference case. Concerns  about energy security, effects of fossil fuel emissions on the environment, and  sustained high world oil prices in the long term support expanded use of  nonfossil renewable energy sources and nuclear power, as well as natural gas,  which is the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel. With government policies and  incentives promoting the use of nonfossil energy sources in many countries,  renewable energy is the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing source of energy, at an average  rate of 2.6%/year, while nuclear energy use increases by 2.3%/year, and natural  gas use increases by 1.9%/year (Figure 1-5). Coal is the world&rsquo;s slowest  growing form of energy in the Reference case, at an average rate of 0.6%/year  (compared with an average increase of 1.4%/year in total world energy demand).</p>
      <p><span><a href="images/figure_1-5.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-5.png" alt="Figure 1-5. World energy consumption by energy source, 1990â€“2040." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-5_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        
        <p>Fossil  fuels continue to provide most of the world&rsquo;s energy in the IEO2016 Reference  case: in 2040, liquid fuels, natural gas, and coal account for 78% of total  world energy consumption. Petroleum and other liquid fuels remain the largest  source of energy, although their share of total world marketed energy  consumption declines from 33% in 2012 to 30% in 2040. Worldwide, most of the increase in liquid fuels  consumption occurs in the transportation and industrial sectors, with a small  increase in the commercial sector and decreases in the residential and electric  power sectors. The declines in the use of liquid fuels in the residential and  power sectors result from rising world oil prices, which lead to switching from  liquids to alternative fuels where possible. In contrast, the use of liquid  fuels in the transportation and industrial sectors increases even as their prices  continue to rise. Worldwide, consumption of liquid fuels grows by 1.1%/ year in  the transportation sector, and by 1.0%/year in the industrial sector, from 2012  to 2040.</p>
        <p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, the world's total natural gas  consumption increases by 1.9%/year on average, from 120 trillion cubic feet  (Tcf) in 2012 to 133 Tcf in 2020 and to 203 Tcf in 2040. Increasing supplies of  natural gas, particularly from shale formations in the United States and  Canada, and eventually elsewhere, help to supply global markets. In the future,  advances in the application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  technologies, which have contributed to the rapid increase in U.S. natural gas  production, are applied in other parts of the world, with the newly available  natural gas resources supporting worldwide growth in natural gas consumption. From  2012 to 2040, world natural gas demand increases in all end-use sectors, with  the largest increments in the electric power sector and the industrial sector,  which together account for nearly 75% of the total increase in world natural  gas consumption.</p>
          <p>Coal is the slowest-growing energy source in the IEO2016  Reference case, with 0.6%/year average increases in total world coal  consumption from 2012 to 2040, considerably slower than the 2.2%/year average over  the past 30 years [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#11">11</a>]. Coal  consumption slows (or declines) in every region of the world from 2012 to 2040.  In China, where coal use has increased by an average of nearly 6.0%/year over  the past 30 years, the increases in the Reference case average only 0.3%/year from  2012 to 2040. China&rsquo;s recent moves to reduce coal as a means of addressing air  pollution in major urban areas, and the government&rsquo;s announcement in November 2015  that the country&rsquo;s carbon dioxide emissions would peak by 2030, result in lower  coal demand for China in the IEO2016 Reference case than in previous IEOs. Only  2 years ago, in the IEO2013 Reference case projections, coal use in China totaled  121 quadrillion Btu in 2040. In IEO2016, China&rsquo;s coal use reaches 88  quadrillion Btu in 2025 before declining to 83 quadrillion Btu in 2040.</p>
        <p> Coal consumption projections in the IEO2016 Reference case,  which total 169 quadrillion Btu in 2020 and 180 quadrillion Btu in 2040, do not  include the effect of the final Clean Power Plan regulations in the United  States. Including the CPP would reduce world coal consumption to 165 quadrillion  Btu in 2020 and to 176 quadrillion Btu in 2040, based on EIA&rsquo;s analysis of the  CPP proposed rule [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#12">12</a>].EIA&rsquo;s  analysis of the final rule is expected to show a roughly similar impact on  projections of U.S. coal use.</p>
<p>Electricity consumption by end users grows faster  than their use of other delivered energy sources in the Reference case, as has  been true for the past several decades. Net electricity generation worldwide  rises by 1.9%/year on average from 2012 to 2040, with the strongest growth in  non-OECD countries. Increases in non-OECD electricity generation average 2.5%/year  in the IEO2016 Reference case as rising living standards increase demand for  home appliances and electronic devices as well as for commercial services,  including hospitals, schools, office buildings, and retail and grocery stores.  In the OECD nations, where infrastructures are more mature and population  growth is relatively slow or declining, electric power generation increases by  an average of 1.2%/year from 2012 to 2040.</p>
<p>Coal,  which currently provides the largest share of energy for world electricity  generation in the IEO2016 Reference case (Figure 1-6), declines from 40% of  total generation in 2012 to 29% in 2040 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#13">13</a>].  In addition, if the U.S. CPP were included in the projections, the coal share  of world generation would be 28% in 2040. The liquid fuels share of total  generation also falls in the IEO2016 Reference case, as other fuels are  substituted for higher-priced liquids in the power generation sector. The  liquids share of total generation falls from 5% in 2012 to less than 2% in  2040. Natural gas and renewable energy sources account for increasing shares of  total generation, with the natural gas share growing from 22% in 2012 to 28% in  2040 and the renewable share growing from 22% in 2012 to 29% in 2040. If the  U.S. CPP were included, the renewable share of world generation would increase  to 30% in 2040. Renewable generation (including hydropower) is the  fastest-growing source of electric power in the IEO2016 Reference case, rising by  an average of 2.9%/year, compared with average annual increases for natural gas  (2.7%), nuclear power (2.4%), and coal (0.8%). Government policies and  incentives throughout the world support the rapid construction of renewable  generation facilities. By 2040 renewables, natural gas, and coal each hold a  similar share of global electricity generation. </p>
<p><span><a href="images/figure_1-6.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-6.png" alt="Figure 1-6. World net electricity generation by energy source, 2012â€“40." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-6_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p><p>Hydropower and wind are the two largest contributors to the  increase in world electricity generation from renewable energy sources,  together accounting for two-thirds of the total increment from 2012 to 2040.  Both hydropower and wind generation increase by about 1.9 trillion  kilowatthours (kWh) in the IEO2016 Reference case. Although nonhydropower  resources account for most of the increase in world renewable generation, hydropower  provides nearly 40% of the growth in the non-OECD region. Strong increases in  non-OECD hydroelectricity generation, primarily from mid- to large-scale power  plants, are expected in Brazil and in non-OECD Asia (particularly in China and  India), which in combination account for more than 75% of the total increase in  non-OECD hydroelectricity generation from 2012 to 2040.</p>     
        <p>Hydroelectric potential in the OECD region is  much lower than in the non-OECD region, because most of the economically  exploitable hydroelectric resources in OECD countries already have been  developed. Except in a few casesâ€”notably, Canada and Turkey&#8212;there are few  opportunities to expand large- and mid-scale hydroelectric power projects in  the OECD. Instead, most renewable energy growth in OECD countries comes from  wind and solar resources. Many OECD countries, particularly those in Europe,  have government policies (including feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and  market share quotas) that encourage construction of wind and other nonhydropower  renewable electricity facilities. In the IEO2016 Reference case, 82% of the  growth in OECD renewable energy consumption is attributed to nonhydropower  renewables (Figure 1-7).</p>
        <p><span><a href="images/figure_1-7.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-7.png" alt="FFigure 1-7. World net electricity generation from renewable energy sources, 2012 and 2040." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-7_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        <p>Electricity  generation from nuclear power worldwide increases from 2.3 trillion kWh in 2012  to 3.1 trillion kWh in 2020 and to 4.5 trillion kWh in 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case, as concerns about energy security and greenhouse gas emissions  support the development of new nuclear generating capacity. World average  capacity utilization rates for nuclear power plants have continued to rise over  time, from about 68% in 1980 to about 80% in 2012, and they could continue to  improve in many regions. In the Reference case, virtually all of the net  expansion in world installed nuclear power capacity occurs in non-OECD  countries, led by China's addition of 139 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear capacity  from 2012 to 2040 (Figure 1-8). Within the OECD, only South Korea has a sizable  (15 GW) increase in nuclear capacity. Capacity reductions in Canada and OECD  Europe, and in Japan (where nuclear capacity in 2040 in the Reference case  remains below the total before the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear  disaster) more than offset the increase in South Korea&rsquo;s nuclear capacity. As a  result, the combined capacity of all OECD nuclear power plants drops by a net 6  GW from 2012 to 2040.</p>

        <h2>Delivered energy consumption by end-use sector</h2>
        <p>Understanding patterns in the consumption of energy delivered  to end users [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#14">14</a>] is important for the development of projections of global energy use. Outside  the transportation sector, which at present is dominated by liquid fuels, the  mix of energy use in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors varies  widely by region, depending on a combination of regional factors, such as the  availability of energy resources; levels of economic development; and  political, social, and demographic factors.</p>
        <h4>Buildings sector</h4>
        <p>Energy consumed in the buildings sector, divided between  residential and commercial end users, accounts for one-fifth of the total  delivered energy consumed worldwide. In the IEO2016 Reference case, total world  energy consumption in buildings increases by an average of 1.5%/year from 2012 to  2040.</p>
         <p> Energy use in the residential sector is defined as the  energy consumed by households, excluding transportation uses. Energy is used in  the residential sector for heating, cooling, lighting, and water heating and for  many other appliances and equipment. Income levels and energy prices influence  the ways in which energy is consumed in the residential sector, as do various  other factors, such as location, building and household characteristics,  weather, equipment types and efficiencies, access to delivered energy,  availability of energy sources, and energy-related policies. As a result, the  types and amounts of energy use by households can vary widely within and across  regions and countries.</p>
        <p>Energy use in homes accounts for about 13% of world  delivered energy consumption in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case. World  residential energy consumption increases by 48% from 2012 to 2040, mainly as a  result of growing residential sector demand in the non-OECD countries. Total  non-OECD residential energy consumption increases by an average of 2.1%/year,  compared with 0.6%/year in the OECD countries. Some of the fastest-growing  sources of residential consumer demand are in the countries of non-OECD Asia  (including China and India), as a result of strong economic growth and expanding  populations in much of the region. In 2040, the combined total residential  energy use of China and India is double their 2012 total and accounts for 27%  of total world residential energy consumption.</p>
          <p>The commercial sector&#8212;often referred to as the <em>service secto</em>r or <em>services and institutional sector</em>&#8212;consists of businesses,  institutions, and organizations that provide services, encompassing many  different types of buildings and a wide range of activities and energy-related  services. In the IEO2016 Reference case, the world&rsquo;s total commercial sector delivered  energy consumption increases by an average of 1.6%/year, and the commercial  sector share of total world delivered energy use rises from about 7% in 2012 to  about 8% in 2040.</p>
        <p> Slow expansion of GDP and either slow growth or a decline in  population in many OECD nations contribute to slower rates of OECD commercial  energy demand growth in the Reference case. In addition, continued efficiency  improvements moderate the growth of energy demand over time, as less efficient  energy-using equipment is replaced with newer, more efficient stock. Among the  OECD nations, delivered energy consumption in the commercial sector increases  by 1.1%/year from 2012 through 2040, compared with an average of 0.6%/year for  the residential sector.</p>
<p>In the non-OECD nations, economic activity and  commerce increase rapidly, fueling additional demand for energy in the service  sectors. Non-OECD population growth is also more rapid than in the OECD  countries, increasing the need for education, health care, and social services  and the energy required to provide them. In addition, as developing nations
mature,  they transition to more service-related enterprises, raising the demand for  energy in the commercial sector. With substantial amounts of energy needed in  the future to fuel growth in commercial buildings, total delivered commercial  energy use in the non-OECD nations grows by 2.4%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the  Reference case, which is more than twice the rate for the OECD commercial sector.</p>

  <h4><a name="discrepancies" id="discrepancies">EIA's handling  of discrepancies in international energy data<em></em></a></h4>
  <p>In IEO2016, readers may  notice instances where estimates of delivered liquid fuels by sector for some  world regions do not add up to estimates of those regions&rsquo; total delivered liquid  fuels. Such discrepancies arise primarily because EIA&rsquo;s modeling of energy  consumption by end-use sector can in some cases lead to disconnects between the  historical data for total consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels and the  consumption estimates produced by the World Energy Projection System Plus  (WEPS+) model. For international data, EIA&rsquo;s estimates of historical energy use  by country are based on outside sources of information, including foreign  governments, the International Energy Agency, and other organizations.  Inevitably, issues of data quality, definitional differences, and timeliness arise.</p>
  <p>    IEO2016 aims to be  internally consistent with all other contemporaneous EIA publications.  Specifically, this report incorporates global historical data from EIA&rsquo;s<em> International Energy Statistics</em> (IES), as  well as projections for the United States from the <em>Short-Term Energy Outlook</em> and the <em>Annual Energy Outlook</em> (AEO). The WEPS+ model used to generate IEO2016  projections is calibrated to IES data by <em>backtesting</em> for a given historical period [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#15">15</a>].  Because the WEPS+ model includes more detail than IES on end-use consumption by  sector for international regions, it can be calibrated to IES data at the fuel  and region levels but not at the end-use sector level. When the sum of regional  consumption from the end-use modules does not match the regional total from  IES, the resulting discrepancy is reported at the region and fuel level in IEO2016.</p>
<p>For several IEO modeling regions, the  discrepancies can be significant. Collection and reporting of international  energy data are decentralized, and uncertainties typically are greater than  those for U.S. energy data. Similarly, the determinants of energy demand  outside the United States are less well understood than those for U.S. energy  demand. As a result, such discrepancies tend to be larger in IEO2016 than in  AEO2015.</p>
</div>
<h4>Industrial sector</h4>
<p>The industrial sector encompasses manufacturing,  agriculture, mining, and construction&#8212;and a wide range of activities, such as  processing and assembly, space conditioning, and lighting. Industrial energy  use also includes natural gas and petroleum products used as feedstocks for the  production of nonenergy products, such as plastics and fertilizer. Industrial  energy demand varies across regions and countries of the world, based on the  level and mix of economic activity and technological development, among other  factors. The industrial sector consumed 54% of global delivered energy in 2012,  and its energy consumption grows by an average of 1.2%/year from 2012 to 2040  in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>
<p>Industrial sector energy use in the non-OECD  economies increases by 1.5%/year in the Reference case, compared with 0.5%/year  in the OECD economies. The gap in growth rates reflects both faster economic expansion  outside the OECD and differences in the composition of industrial sector  production. Industrial operations in the OECD economies generally are more  energy-efficient than those in the non-OECD economies, and the mix of  industrial output is more heavily weighted toward nonenergy-intensive industry  sectors in the OECD. On average, industrial energy intensity (the amount of energy consumed in the industrial sector per  dollar of economic output) in non-OECD countries is much higher than in OECD  countries.</p>
<h4>Transportation sector</h4>
<p>Energy use in the transportation sector includes energy  consumed in moving people and goods by road, rail, air, water, and pipeline.  The transportation sector accounted for 25% of total world delivered energy  consumption in 2012, and transportation energy use increases by 1.4%/year from  2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case. The growth in transportation energy  demand is largely a result of increases projected for the non-OECD nations,  where fast-paced gains in GDP raise standards of living and, correspondingly,  the demand for personal travel and freight transport to meet consumer demand  for goods. Non-OECD transportation energy use increases by 2.5%/year, compared  with average annual growth of 0.2% in the OECD nations, where consuming  patterns are already well established, and slower growth of national economies  and populations, coupled with vehicle efficiency improvements, keep  transportation energy demand from increasing.</p>
  <p>The road transport component of transportation energy use  includes light-duty vehicles, such as automobiles, sport utility vehicles,  minivans, small trucks, and motorbikes, as well as heavy-duty vehicles, such as  large trucks used for moving freight and buses used for passenger travel.  Growth rates for economic activity and population, and trends in vehicle fuel  efficiency, are the key factors in transportation energy demand. Economic  growth spurs increases in industrial output, which requires the movement of raw  materials to manufacturing sites, as well as the movement of manufactured goods  to end users. In addition, increasing demand for personal travel is a primary  contributing factor to underlying increases in energy demand for  transportation. Increases in urbanization and in personal incomes also contribute  to increases in air travel and to motorization (more vehicles per capita) in  the growing non-OECD economies.</p>
  <h2>World economic outlook</h2>
<p>Economic growth, along with accompanying structural changes,  strongly influences world energy consumption. As countries develop and living  standards improve, energy demand grows rapidly. For instance, in nations  experiencing fast-paced economic growth, the share of the populace demanding  improved housingâ€”which requires more energy to construct and maintainâ€”often  increases. Increased demand for appliances and transportation equipment, and  growing capacity to produce goods and services for both domestic and foreign  markets, also lead to higher energy consumption. Over the past 30 years, world  economic growth has been led by the non-OECD countries, accompanied by strong growth  in energy demand in the region. From 1990 to 2012, real GDP grew by 4.9%/year  in non-OECD countries, compared with 2.1%/year in OECD countries. In the  future, the differences in economic growth rates between OECD and non-OECD  nations are expected to narrow, as economic growth in non-OECD countries  moderates, and as their industrial structures move from reliance mainly on  production in energy-intensive industries to more service-oriented industries.  In the IEO2016 Reference case, average GDP in the non-OECD region grows by 4.2%/year  from 2012 to 2040, compared with 2.0%/year in the OECD.</p>
<p>Economic growth in the IEO2016 projections depends  on increases in labor force, growth of capital stock, and improvements in productivity.  Across many of the IEO regions, productivity growth&#8212;also referred to as total  factor productivity (TFP) or multifactor productivity (MFP)&#8212;is especially  uncertain, but it is an important determinant of income per person in the long run.  However, because TFP measures things that cannot be accounted for by other  inputs used in the production of goods and services, identifying the driving  forces behind its growth is difficult. In general, the TFP determinants can be  separated into those that focus on the creation, transfer, and use of knowledge  (broadly
defined), and those that build the infrastructure needed for <em>efficient</em> creation, transfer, and use  of knowledge. Examples of the former determinants include research and  development funding, and human capital. Examples of the latter determinants include  the prevalence of research institutions, the condition of national  infrastructures, competitiveness, and regulatory environment.
The IEO2016 assumptions about regional economic  growth&#8212;measured in terms of real GDP in 2012 U.S. dollars at purchasing power  parity rates&#8212;underlie the projections of regional energy demand. World economic  growth has been steady in recent years, with the global economy growing by 4.0%  in 2011, followed by more modest growth of 3.1% in 2012, 3.2% in 2013, and 3.3%  in 2014. Such steady growth is assumed to continue in the IEO2016 Reference  case, with real world GDP growth averaging 3.3%/year (on a purchasing power  parity basis) from 2012 to 2040 [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#16">16</a>]  (<a href="table1-2.cfm.html">Table 1-2</a>). The growth rate slows over the period, peaking at 3.8% in 2018,  then declines to 3.0% in 2040. Global economic growth in the IEO2016 Reference  case is led by the emerging economies, with growth in real GDP in the non-OECD  region averaging 4.2%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared with 2.0%/year in the  OECD region. Slower global economic growth after 2020 results primarily from slower  growth in the emerging economies, particularly China.
<h4>OECD economies</h4>
<p>From 2012 to 2040, real GDP growth in the OECD  averages 2.0%/year (on a purchasing power parity basis) in the IEO2016  Reference case (Figure 1-9). In the United States, which remains the largest  OECD economic region, real GDP growth averages 2.4%/year from 2012 to 2040. Slower  growth of the U.S. labor force over the projection period, as the baby boom  generation retires, is partially offset by increases in productivity. Changes  in productivity growth are the key source of uncertainty in the U.S.  projection.</p>
        <p><span><a href="images/figure_1-9.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-9.png" alt="Figure 1-9. OECD real gross domestic product growth rates, 2012â€“40." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-9_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        <p>Canada's  economic growth in the Reference case, at 2.1%/year from 2012 to 2040, is  slower than that of the United States. Although recent declines in oil prices  reduce Canadian GDP growth in the near term, prospects for the long term are  relatively healthy, given Canada's record of fiscal prudence and the productive  capacity of its economy. Canada has also diversified beyond commodity  production, with services accounting for more than 70% of Canadian value added  [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#17">17</a>].</p>
        <p>Chile and Mexico are the fastest-growing OECD countries from  2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, with their combined GDP increasing  by an average of 3.1% annually. Because the two nations are primarily exporters,  especially of commodities, short-term and long-term commodity prices will  substantially affect export revenues&#8212;as will fluctuations in exchange rates  with major trading partners. Although both countries are well positioned for  medium- to long-run growth, given their expanding working-age populations,  there are also concerns about infrastructure, competitiveness (especially in  Mexico), and education.</p>
        <p>GDP growth in OECD Europe increases by an average of 1.7%/year  in the IEO2016 Reference case, which is the second slowest rate among the OECD  regions, after Japan. In the near term, most European countries still have to  deal with the aftermath of the European financial crisis and ensuing credit  issues, which have slowed recent GDP gains and depressed investment. In the  longer term, OECD Europe sees moderate increases in productivity, driven by  research and development and a well-educated population; however, the region&rsquo;s  overall population growth is expected to slow, and the working-age population is  projected to begin declining shortly after 2020. Increases in capital stock are  moderate over the projection period.</p>
         <p> Japan has the slowest-growing economy among the OECD regions  over the projection period, averaging 0.6%/year, attributed primarily to  demographic trends. Japan's population, which began to shrink in 2012, continues  declining at an average annual rate of 0.4% from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case. Moreover, Japan's working-age population began to decline in  the mid-1990s [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#18">18</a>].  Combining the demographic trends with relatively slow growth in Japan&rsquo;s capital  stock and moderate increases in productivity results in the low projected rate  of GDP growth from 2012 to 2040.</p>
         <p>South Korea's economy grows by 2.1%/year on average in the IEO2016  Reference case, with its population growth (like Japan's) slowing over the  projection period to an average of 0.2%/year, and the working age population  beginning to decline after 2015. Increases in the country&rsquo;s capital stock and  productivity do not make up for these demographic factors, even though capital  investment remains an important part of its real GDP growth.</p>
          <p>In Australia and New Zealand, long-term growth prospects are  also relatively healthy, given their consistent track records of fiscal  prudence and structural reforms aimed at maintaining competitive product and  flexible labor markets. Geographically, the two countries are well positioned  to benefit from export market opportunities in emerging Asian countries;  however, their aging populations may be one barrier to higher rates of economic  growth in the medium to long term. In the IEO2016 Reference case, the combined  GDP of Australia and New Zealand grows by an average of 2.6%/year from 2012 to  2040.</p>
        <h4>Non-OECD economies</h4>
<p>Real GDP growth from 2012 to 2040 in the combined  non-OECD region averages 4.2%/year in the IEO2016 Reference case (Figure 1-10).  Investment and exports support GDP increases in the near term, although slower  growth in the advanced economies and the potential for inflation are concerns.  In the medium to long term, population growth, the potential for technological  advancement, and lower debt levels help to support faster economic expansion in  the non-OECD region. Achieving faster economic growth will require additional  infrastructure investment and improvements in regulatory and financial  institutions.</p>
<p><span><a href="images/figure_1-10.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-10.png" alt="Figure 1-10. Non-OECD real gross domestic product growth rates, 2012â€“40." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-10_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>  <p>India has the world's fastest-growing economy in the IEO2016  Reference case, averaging 5.5%/year from 2012 to 2040. In the shorter term, the  combination of lower interest rates and moderate inflation supports increases  in both consumption and investment. Additional structural reforms&#8212;such as  ending regulatory impediments to the consolidation of labor-intensive  industries, reforming labor markets and bankruptcy terms, and liberalizing agricultural  and trade practices&#8212;will be essential for achieving the projected GDP growth  rates over the longer term.</p>
        <p>China&rsquo;s economic growth in 2014 was its lowest in 24 years,  and it continues to slow in the IEO2016 Reference case with an average growth  rate of 4.7%/year from 2012 to 2040. The slower economic growth is in part the  result of demographicsâ€”China has an aging population and shrinking work force&#8212;accompanied  by a slower rate of productivity that fails to make up for lower levels of investment.  The fate of nonperforming loans, and the extent to which reforms are allowed to  influence state-owned enterprises, both are key uncertainties in the projection  for China&rsquo;s GDP growth. On the other hand, China&rsquo;s economy is expected to  undergo a transition over the 2012&#8211;40  period, from being dominated by investment to achieving a better balance  between consumption and investment.</p>
          <p>Many of the other economies of non-OECD Asia have benefited  from trade ties with&#8212;and are largely reliant on&#8212;China. For those that depend on  exports (including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and Taiwan), China's  slowing economy is likely to slow their GDP growth in the near term. However, many  non-OECD Asia countries also trade heavily with the United States, Japan, and  OECD Europe, and as a result their economic performance is intertwined with  demand from the advanced economies. In the long term, growth prospects in  non-OECD Asia remain favorable. Excluding China and India, real GDP in non-OECD  Asia grows by an average of 4.1%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case.</p>
          <p>In Russia, lower oil prices and sanctions have substantially  reduced the short-term prospect for economic growth. Russia also faces  challenges in the longer term related to the continuing shrinkage of its labor  force and population, and to the need for diversification of its economy away  from its current heavy reliance on energy exports. Additionally, reforms in  labor markets and state-owned enterprises will be important for long-term  growth. In the IEO2016 Reference case, Russia&rsquo;s economy grows by an average of  2.0%/year from 2012 to 2040.</p>
<p>Exports also are an important component of GDP  for the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans, especially given their  large fiscal deficits. Banks and other entities in non-OECD Europe and Eurasia continue  to face difficulties in gaining access to foreign loans, as many lending  institutions have restricted cross-border loans. The restricted access to loans
    has  lowered investment levels and may also affect future productivity. The effects were  softened somewhat by higher world market prices for commodity exports over the  past several years, but recent declines may slow growth in the near term. In  the longer term, these countries have the potential for faster economic  expansion, and economic growth in the non-OECD Europe and Eurasia region (excluding  Russia) averages 3.7%/year from 2012 to 2040.</p>
<p>Projected growth of real GDP in Brazil in IEO2016 averages  2.4%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the Reference case. This is a relatively slow  rate of growth, especially for a developing country, reflecting both current  economic weakness and questions about future growth. There is little doubt that  Brazil has the consumers to generate demand for goods and services, but the  supply side of its economy appears to constrain economic growth. Structural  reforms, particularly to state-owned enterprises and labor markets, will be  important for Brazil to generate long-term growth.</p>
<p>Outside Brazil, investment in the non-OECD Americas is  constrained by policy uncertainty, and commodity exports are not expected to  provide the level of government revenue that they have in the recent past. The  proximity of the region to the United States and the trade relationships of its  national economies with the U.S. economy suggest that the region&rsquo;s growth will  be linked, in part, to that of the United States. Most countries in the region  have flexible exchange rates, positive trade balances, and relatively low  fiscal deficits and public debts. Regional inflation is lower than it was in  the mid-1990s, and a relatively young labor force supports the region&rsquo;s  economic growth prospects. Real GDP in the non-OECD Americas (excluding Brazil)  increases by an average of 2.8%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference  case.</p>
<p>Africa's combined real GDP increases by 4.8%/year on average  from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case. However, economic prospects  for African countries vary widely across the continent. Africa is rich in  natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and coal. Overall, the region  has a relatively young population, with potential for labor force growth.  Except for South Africa, many sub-Saharan African countries have seen recent annual  growth rates between 4% and 10%, with Ethiopia experiencing the highest growth  in 2013, at 10.4% [<a href="footnotes.cfm.html#19">19</a>].  Expanding domestic markets and increasing regional integration will support  long-term growth, although Africa faces many challenges. Oil exports from  northern Africa and most of sub-Saharan Africa are slowing because of lower world  oil prices. Moreover, both economic and political factors&#8212;such as low savings  and investment rates, lack of strong economic and political institutions, limited  quantity and quality of infrastructure and human capital, negative perceptions  on the part of international investors, protracted civil unrest and political  disturbances, and the impacts of various diseases&#8212;present formidable obstacles  to the economies of some African countries.</p>
<p>Economic growth in the Middle East region averages  3.7%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case. This region is  challenged by continuing geopolitical instability that discourages foreign  investment, as well as heavy reliance on commodity exports for economic growth.  In recent years, rising oil production and prices have helped to boost economic  growth in the oil-exporting countries of the Middle East, many of which have also  benefited from spillover effects on trade, tourism, and financial flows from  the region&rsquo;s oil exports. In the short run, political instabilities combined  with lower expected oil revenues are likely to constrain growth. Over the long  run, however, robust population growth, combined with the potential for rising  oil prices and rebounding demand for the region&rsquo;s export commodities, create  favorable prospects for economic growth in the Middle East. The medium to long  term still presents many challenges. Political turmoil and domestic unrest  threaten to depress consumer confidence and investment. Training and educating  the labor force, and the dependence of many Middle East countries on commodity
exports for growth, also are key challenges for regional  economic growth prospects, with reliance on oil and natural gas revenues  continuing through much of the projection period.</p>
<h2>Alternative cases in IEO2016</h2>
<h4>Alternative economic growth cases</h4>
<p>Expectations for future rates of economic growth are a major  source of uncertainty in the IEO2016 projections. To illustrate the  uncertainties associated with economic growth trends, IEO2016 includes a High  Economic Growth case and a Low Economic Growth case in addition to the  Reference case. The two alternative growth cases use different assumptions  about future economic growth paths, while maintaining the oil price path of the  IEO2016 Reference case.</p>
  <p>In the High Economic Growth case, real GDP in the OECD  increases by 2.3%/year from 2012 to 2040, as compared with 2.0%/year in the  Reference case. Similarly, the High Economic Growth case assumes GDP growth of  4.5%/year in the non-OECD region as a whole, compared with 4.2%/year in the  Reference case. In the Low Economic Growth case, OECD GDP increases by  1.6%/year, or 0.4 percentage points lower than in the Reference case. GDP growth  in the non-OECD region is assumed to average 3.9%/year in the Low Economic  Growth case, or 0.3 percentage points lower than in the Reference case.</p>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, world energy  consumption totals 815 quadrillion Btu in 2040&#8212;282 quadrillion Btu in the OECD  countries and 533 quadrillion Btu in the non-OECD countries. In the High  Economic Growth case, world energy use in 2040 is 862 quadrillion Btu&#8212;47  quadrillion Btu (about 24 million barrels oil equivalent per day) higher than  in the Reference case (Figure 1-11). In the Low Economic Growth Case, world  energy use in 2040 totals 764 quadrillion Btu&#8212;51 quadrillion Btu (about 25  million barrels oil equivalent per day) lower than in the Reference case. Thus,  the projections for 2040 in the High and Low Economic Growth cases span a range  of uncertainty equal to 98 quadrillion Btu, which is roughly equal to total  U.S. energy consumption in 2012.</p>
<p><span><a href="images/figure_1-11.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-11.png" alt="Figure 1-11. World energy consumption by region in three economic growth cases, 2012, 2025, and 2040." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-12_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p> 
<h4>Alternative oil price cases</h4>
<p>Expectations for future world oil prices are  another key source of uncertainty in the IEO2016 projections. To illustrate the  uncertainties associated with future oil prices, IEO2016 includes a Low Oil  Price case and a High Oil Price case in
addition to the Reference case. The two alternative oil  price cases use different assumptions about future oil prices, based on four  key factors: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  investment and production decisions; the economics of non-OPEC petroleum  liquids supply; the economics of other liquids supply; and world demand for  petroleum and other liquids. Each case represents one of many possible  combinations of supply and demand that would result in the same price path.</p>
<p>Real oil prices (in 2013 dollars) have fallen precipitously  since 2011, from about $115 per barrel to about $50 per barrel in 2015  (according to EIA&rsquo;s March 2016 <em>Short-Term  Energy Outlook</em>). Prices are expected to recover over the course of the  projection period, reaching $141 per barrel in 2040. Total world spending on  oil grows 1.6%/year over the projection, well below the 3.3%/year rate of  income growth over the same period, suggesting that a smaller share of income  would be required to cover consumer oil needs. The IEO2016 Reference case  reflects mid-range expectations for exploration and development costs and  accessibility of oil resources. The Reference case also assumes that OPEC  producers will choose to maintain their share at 39% to 43% of the global  liquid fuels market. In the Reference case, OECD consumption of petroleum and  other liquids increases from 45.5 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2012 to 46.1  million b/d in 2040, and non-OECD consumption of petroleum and other liquids  increases from 44.8 b/d to 74.8 million b/d. Total energy consumption in the  Reference case rises to 815 quadrillion Btu in 2040.</p>
<p>In the Low Oil Price case, crude oil prices are $76 per  barrel (2013 dollars) in 2040. GDP growth in the non-OECD countries averages  3.9%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared with Reference case growth of 4.2%/year.  A combination of lower economic activity and lower prices results in a level of  non-OECD liquid fuels consumption in 2040 close to that in the Reference case.  Even in a scenario assuming low economic growth (which translates to lower  energy demand, with non-OECD energy demand in 2040 24 quadrillion Btu lower  than in the Reference case), the lower prices encourage consumers to use relatively  cheap liquid fuels rather than other forms of energy.</p>
<p>In contrast to the non-OECD, economic growth in the OECD  regions is essentially the same in the Low Oil Price case as in the Reference  case, and total OECD energy consumption in 2040 also is about the same as in  the Reference case. However, lower oil prices encourage consumers to use more  liquid fuels. OECD nations consume 48.4 million b/d of oil in 2040 in the Low  Oil Price case, compared to 46.1 million b/d in the Reference case.</p>
<p>On the supply side, production in OPEC countries is above the  Reference case level in the Low Oil Price case, obtaining a 48% share of total  world petroleum and other liquids production in 2040. Oil production in the  non-OPEC countries is lower than in the Reference case, however, because their  more expensive resources cannot be brought to market economically.</p>
<p>In the High Oil Price case, oil prices increase  to $252 per barrel (2013 dollars) in 2040. GDP growth in the non-OECD countries  averages 4.5%/year from 2012 to 2040 in the High Oil Price case, compared with  4.2%/year in the Reference case. The combination of high economic activity and  high prices results in non-OECD liquids consumption that is about the same as  in the Reference case (Figure 1-12). Although higher economic activity  increases non-OECD demand for total energy (total non-OECD energy consumption  is about 32 quadrillion Btu higher in the High Oil Price case than in the  Reference case), the higher costs for liquid fuels encourage consumers to use  other energy sources.</p>
        <p><span><a href="images/figure_1-12.png" class="lightbox"><img src="images/figure_1-12.png" alt="Figure 1-12. World energy consumption by fuel in three oil price cases, 2012 and 2040." width="322" /></a><br /> 
        <span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure1-12_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
        <p>OECD  economic growth in the High Oil Price case is unchanged from the Reference  case, and as a result total energy demand is similar in the two cases. The higher  oil prices, combined with the same level of economic activity as in the IEO2016  Reference case, cause OECD consumers to implement improved efficiency measures  and switch to less expensive fuels where possible. In 2040, OECD regions  consume 44.1 million b/d in the High Oil Price case, compared with 46.1 million  b/d in the Reference case. On the supply side, oil production in the OPEC  countries is lower in the High Oil Price case, and their market share declines  to 34% in 2040. However, higher world oil prices allow non-OPEC countries to increase  production from resources that are more expensive to produce, and the economics  of nonpetroleum liquids also benefit from the higher prices.	        </p>
