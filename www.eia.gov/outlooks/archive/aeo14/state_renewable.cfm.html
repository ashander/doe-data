      <p class="release">Release Date: 4/30/14</p>


<p>To the extent possible, AEO2014 reflects state laws and regulations in effect at the end of October 2013 that require the addition
  of renewable generation or capacity by utilities doing business in the state [<a class="endnotes">17</a>] to meet RPS requirements. The projection does
  not include laws and regulations with either voluntary goals or targets that can be substantially satisfied with nonrenewable
  resources. In addition, the projection does not account for fuel-specific provisions&#8212;such as those for solar and offshore wind
  energy&#8212;as distinct targets. Where applicable, such distinct targets (sometimes referred to as &quot;tiers,&quot; &quot;set-asides,&quot; or &quot;carveouts&quot;)
  may be subsumed into the broader targets, or they may not be included in the model because they could be met with
  existing capacity and/or projected growth based on modeled economic and policy factors.</p>
<p>  States are projected to meet their ultimate RPS targets in the AEO2014 Reference case. The RPS compliance constraints in most
  regions are approximated, however, because National Energy Modeling System is not a state-level model, and each state generally
  represents only a portion of one of the NEMS electricity regions. In general, EIA has confirmed the states' requirements through
  original legislative or regulatory documentation, although the Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency was also
  used to support those efforts [<a class="endnotes">18</a>]. The aggregate RPS requirement for various mandatory state programs, as modeled for
  AEO2014, is shown in Figure LR3-1. In 2025, the targets
  account for slightly less than 10% of U.S. electricity sales.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig_lr3-1.png" /><br />
  <a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo14/excel/figlr3-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a></p>
<p>  At present, most states are meeting or exceeding their
  required levels of renewable generation, based on qualified
  generation or purchase of renewable energy credits [<a class="endnotes">19</a>].
  A number of factors have helped to create an environment
  favorable for RPS compliance, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A surge of new RPS-qualified generation capacity timed
  to take advantage of federal incentives.</li>
  <li>Significant reductions in the cost of wind, solar, and other renewable technologies.</li>
  <li>Generally slower growth of electricity sales.</li>
  <li>Complementary state and local policies that either reduce the cost (for example, equipment rebates) or increase the revenue streams (for example, net metering) associated with RPS-eligible technologies.</li></ul>
<p>  EIA projects that, overall, RPS-qualified generation will
  continue to meet or exceed aggregate mandatory targets for
   state RPS programs through 2040, as shown in Figure LR3-1.</p>
<p>The aggregate near-term surplus of qualified generation is supported by projected near-term renewable capacity additions but
  declines slightly as growth in renewable capacity slows toward the end of this decade and RPS targets catch up with supply. The
  surplus widens again in the final two decades of the projection period, as renewable generation technologies become increasingly
  competitive with conventional generation sources and state targets generally do not increase beyond 2025.</p>
<p>  It is important to note, however, that the aggregate targets and qualifying generation shown in Figure LR3-1 may mask significant
  regional variation, as well as technology- or tier-specific shortfalls. While some regions may produce excess qualifying generation,
  others may produce just enough to meet the requirement or may need to import generation from adjoining regions to meet state
  targets. Furthermore, even though there is more qualifying generation in aggregate than is needed to meet the targets, states with
  technology-specific goals could still have deficits for certain technologies. Also, this projected pattern of aggregate surplus does
  not necessarily imply that projected generation would be the same without state RPS policies. State RPS policies may encourage
  investment in places where it otherwise would not occur or would not occur in the amounts projected, even as other parts of the
  country see substantial growth above state targets or in their absence. It does, however, suggest that state RPS programs will not
  be the sole reason for future growth in renewable generation, and that the importance of RPS targets in contributing to growth in
  renewable generation will decline over time.</p>
<p>  Currently, 29 states and the District of Columbia have enforceable RPS or similar laws (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo14/tablelr3_1.cfm">Table LR3-1</a>) [<a class="endnotes">20</a>]. Under such standards,
  each state determines its own levels of renewable generation, eligible technologies [<a class="endnotes">21</a>], and noncompliance penalties. No new
  RPS programs have been enacted since 2009. There have been a number of modifications to existing programs in recent years,
  however, building on state implementation experience and changing market conditions.</p>
<p>  The year 2013 saw a large number of proposed legislative modifications to existing RPS programs [<a class="endnotes">22</a>], including some attempts
  to weaken the targets of existing programs significantly. However, only a small subset was enacted, and no states passed
  major rollbacks or repeals of RPS programs. The changes that were enacted affect some aspects of the laws and implementing
  regulations, but in general they do not have substantive effects on the representation of state RPS programs in the AEO2014
  Reference case. Key changes include:</p>
<h4>Colorado</h4>
  <p>Senate Bill 13-252 [<a class="endnotes">23</a>], signed into law in June 2013, doubles the renewable energy target for large electric cooperatives and
  cooperative associations to 20% of total electric sales by 2020. The law also adds a renewable distributed generation requirement
  for electric cooperatives, removes preferential credit multipliers for in-state eligible sources, and expands the set of qualifying
  energy sources to include coal-mine methane and pyrolysis gas from municipal solid waste.</p>  
  <h4>Connecticut</h4>
  <p>Senate Bill 1138 [<a class="endnotes">24</a>], enacted in June 2013, relaxes restrictions on how hydroelectric generation can be applied to Connecticut's
    RPS. The statute expands the set of qualifying Class I resources to include run-of-river hydropower up to 30 MW&#8212;an increase
    over the previous cap of 5 MW&#8212;as well as additional sources, such as geothermal electric and some types of biogas. In addition,
    large-scale hydropower (greater than 30 MW) could, under specified circumstances, be allowed to meet an increasing portion of
    the RPS, starting at 1% of sales in 2016 and rising to 5% of sales by 2020.</p>  
  <h4>Maryland</h4>
  <p>The Maryland Offshore Wind Energy Act of 2013, House Bill 226 [<a class="endnotes">25</a>], was enacted in April 2013. The legislation adds to Maryland's
    existing RPS an offshore wind technology-specific requirement of up to 2.5% of total sales starting in 2017. Qualifying offshore
    facilities must be located in specific areas of the Outer Continental Shelf and are subject to a defined process for approval by
    the Maryland Public Service Commission. Projects will be subject to several cost containment triggers: the impact on residential
    customers cannot exceed $1.50 per month, and renewable energy credits for offshore wind should not exceed $190 per MWh.</p> 
  <h4>Minnesota</h4>
  <p>In May 2013 Minnesota enacted House Floor 729 [<a class="endnotes">26</a>], which mandates that investor-owned utilities meet a solar technology specific  standard of 1.5% of sales by 2020. This minimum is in addition to Minnesota's previously existing target, effectively raising the total percentage of required renewable generation for investor-owned utilities by 1.5%. Of the new solar mandate, 10%
    must be achieved via small systems that are 20 kilowatts or less. The bill also directs investor-owned utilities to design a &quot;value of
    solar&quot; tariff that could be used in lieu of a traditional retail rate-compensated net metering agreement.</p>
  <h4>Montana</h4>
  <p>Montana enacted several bills during 2013 related to the state’s RPS [<a class="endnotes">27</a>]. Major changes include expanding the set of RPS qualifying technologies to include generation from additional sources, such as: incremental capacity additions at existing hydropower projects; storage technologies such as flywheels, batteries, and hydroelectric pumped storage; and certain types of chemically treated biomass burned at small plants. Small utilities serving 50 or fewer customers are now exempt from the
    obligation to meet the state's RPS.</p>
  <h4>Nevada</h4>
  <p>    In June 2013 Nevada enacted Senate Bill 252 [<a class="endnotes">28</a>], which places new limits on the extent to which energy efficiency measures count
    toward the state's existing standard. The bill also restricts multiplier credits for customer-sited solar generation to installations
    placed in service before the end of 2015. The obligated utility, Nevada Energy, is also now required by Senate Bill 123 [<a class="endnotes">29</a>] to meet
    a capacity standard of 350 MW of new renewable capacity by the end of 2021. However, the same capacity can also be applied
    to the existing sales-based standard and thus does not necessarily require additional capacity beyond that which may have been required to meet the existing standard.</p>
  <h4>Washington</h4>
  <p>    Washington enacted two bills&#8212;Senate Bills 5400 [<a class="endnotes">30</a>] and 5297 [<a class="endnotes">31</a>]&#8212;that increase compliance flexibility options for certain
    providers. Under Senate Bill 5400, utilities that serve customers in multiple states are now allowed to meet their obligations
    with sources from those states. Senate Bill 5297 allows for the use of &quot;coal transition power&quot; for compliance under very specific
    circumstances for utilities not experiencing load growth.</p>

<li>Enumerations of state RPS policies may vary from source to source, as these policies vary significantly from state to state with
  no universal definition. Previous enumerations of 30 state RPS policies by EIA have included a policy in West Virginia that
  allows for several types of fossil generators to be built instead of renewable generators to meet the portfolio requirement.
  However, because EIA does not model this in the Annual Energy Outlook as an RPS, it is not included in the current enumeration.</li>

<li>Eligible technologies, and even the definitions of technologies or fuel categories, vary by state. For example, one state's
  definition of renewables may include hydropower while another's may not. Table LR-1 provides more detail on how the
