      <h1>Recent environmental regulations in the electric power sector</h1>
      <p class="author">jeffrey jones/

      <p class="release">Release Date: 4/30/14</p>


<p>Several environmental rules recently implemented at the federal and state levels affect the AEO2014 projections for the electric
  power sector. While not considered in the AEO2014 Reference case, the EPA is also currently in the process of developing new
  rules to address electric power plant air emissions, the impact of cooling water intake systems on aquatic life, and coal ash
  disposal methods. New rules that may be promulgated could have significant impacts on the projected fuel mix for electric power
  generation. The following discussion summarizes programs and rules included in the AEO2014 Reference case.</p>
<h2>Recent regional policy modifications</h2>  
<p>The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a regional cap-and-trade program for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that applies specifically to
  fossil-fueled electric power plants larger than 25 megawatts (MW) located in each of the nine participating Northeastern states
  [<a class="endnotes">6</a>]. When it took effect in 2009, RGGI became the first mandatory market-based (cap-and-trade) CO<sub>2</sub> reduction program in
  the United States. The cap was tightened primarily because actual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the region since the start of the program in
  2009 have been roughly 35% below the cumulative cap. The lower level of emissions is attributed primarily to historically low
  natural gas prices, which have shifted a large share of electricity generation in the region toward natural gas, and to lower overall
  electricity demand.</p>
<p>  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the RGGI region comprised only 4% of the total emissions from the electric power sector in the United States
  in 2012. RGGI is one of the two legally mandated CO<sub>2</sub> cap-and-trade reduction programs in the United States, the other being the
  California cap-and-trade program that was an outgrowth of California's Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of
  2006 (AB 32) [<a class="endnotes">7</a>].</p>
<p>  In 2005, when CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the participating states reached their annual peak, coal comprised 23%, natural gas 25%, and
  petroleum 12% of the regional generation mix. By 2012, coal's share had declined to 9%, the natural gas share had risen to 44%,
  and the petroleum share had fallen below 1%.</p>
<p>  At the same time that the shift in fuels for electricity generation has lowered the carbon intensity of electricity generation in
  the region, demand for electricity in the Northeast has been flat or declining. Average annual retail electricity sales in the nine
  participating states from 2009 through 2012 were 6% below the annual sales in 2005.</p>
<p>Despite the reduction in the cap beginning in 2014, it remains to be seen whether the updated program caps will result in significant
  emissions reductions compared to the outcomes that might occur absent the new caps. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2012 in the participating
  states were still only 92 million short tons, close to the 2014 target cap of 91 million short tons. However, the cap is designed to
  tighten annually through 2020. In the first half of 2013, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal-fired generation were up both in the RGGI region
  and nationally compared with 2012 levels, which indicates that the revised cap could become more binding in the future.</p>
<p>  Because of a surplus of allowances during the initial years of RGGI, the CO<sub>2</sub> value of the allowances remained close to the
  program's price floor of $1.93/ton of CO<sub>2</sub> allowed in each quarterly auction. The value of allowances increased to $3.00/ton
  of CO<sub>2</sub> in the latest auction, as market participants may be anticipating a rise in the future value of allowances. RGGI states use
  allowance revenues for a variety of programs that support cleaner generation and/or energy efficiency programs that reduce
  demand. Unless the programs supported by RGGI auction revenues are funded at the same level using other funding sources in
  the absence of RGGI, they will provide a tangible incremental reduction in emissions.</p>
<p>  The RGGI program update grants the ability for previously unused allowances from the early years of the program to be saved
  and applied after 2014, as limits become more stringent&#8212;a strategy often referred to as &quot;banking allowances.&quot; Additional
  flexibility exists in the program through the recently created Cost Containment Reserve, which effectively creates a price ceiling
  for allowances. When the price hits a given level, program participants can purchase a set level of allowances at a defined fixed
  price. This ceiling is intended to prevent allowance prices from rising above defined levels. The price trigger starts at $4/ton of
  CO<sub>2</sub> in 2014 and rises to $10/ton of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2017.</p>
<p>  The program also allows for the limited use of CO<sub>2</sub> offsets as a compliance option. RGGI program participants are permitted to
  cover 3.3% of their emissions using offsets. Although the RGGI caps have been lowered, it remains to be seen how much the new
  caps will affect generation choices and related emissions.</p>
<h2>Recent federal environmental regulations modeled in AEO2014</h2>
<p>  The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) [<a class="endnotes">8</a>] requires fossil-fuel steam electric generators to meet limits based on maximum
  achievable control technologies (MACT) to control emissions of acid gases, toxic metals, and mercury. The standards will take
  effect by April 2015 for electric generation units with capacities greater than 25 MW. The rule allows for state environmental  permitting agencies to grant one-year compliance extensions, which AEO2014 assumes will be granted, and all applicable  units must begin to comply with the rule at the beginning of 2016. AEO2014 assumes that, in order to comply with the rule, all  qualifying coal-fired power plants will be equipped with either flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubbers or dry sorbent injection  (DSI) systems and activated carbon injection if warranted for mercury control. The control equipment needed to reduce mercury  is specific to each plant configuration and coal type [<a class="endnotes">9</a>].</p>
<p>  MATS is currently being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in White Stallion Energy Center  et al. v. U.S. EPA [<a class="endnotes">10</a>]. The case was heard in December 2013, and a decision is expected in the spring of 2014.</p>
<p>  The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) [<a class="endnotes">11</a>] is a cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and  nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) from fossil-fueled power plant units with capacities greater than 25 MW in 27 eastern states and the  District of Columbia. The emissions caps went into effect in 2009 for NOX and in 2010 for SO<sub>2</sub>. Both caps are scheduled to be  tightened in 2015. AEO2014 includes the CAIR cap-and-trade program for the applicable regions. The FGD scrubbers or DSI  systems required by MATS result in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions falling to levels lower than the CAIR cap. Therefore, after MATS is in full effect  starting in 2016, SO<sub>2</sub> emissions decline significantly below the CAIR cap, essentially making CAIR's SO<sub>2</sub> cap nonbinding [<a class="endnotes">12</a>].</p>
<p>  CAIR was reinstated after the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District  of Columbia Circuit in August 2012 [<a class="endnotes">13</a>]. However, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in June 2013 to review the D.C. Circuit Court's  decision and heard the case in December 2013 [<a class="endnotes">14</a>]. A court decision is expected in the spring of 2014. If the Supreme Court
  reverses the D.C. Circuit Court's ruling, CSAPR will replace CAIR.</p>
