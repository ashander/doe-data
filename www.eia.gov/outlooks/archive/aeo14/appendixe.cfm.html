    <h2>NEMS overview and brief description of cases</h2>
      

<h3>The National Energy Modeling System</h3>
<p>Projections in the <em>Annual Energy Outlook 2014</em> (AEO2014) are generated using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) [<a class="endnotes">1</a>], developed and maintained by the Office of Energy Analysis of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). In addition to its use in developing the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) projections, NEMS is used to complete analytical studies for the U.S. Congress, the Executive Office of the President, other offices within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal agencies. NEMS is also used by nongovernment groups, such as the Electric Power Research Institute, Duke University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. In addition, AEO projections are used by analysts and planners in other government agencies and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>The projections in NEMS are developed with the use of a market-based approach, subject to regulations and standards. For each fuel and consuming sector, NEMS balances energy supply and demand, accounting for economic competition across the various energy fuels and sources. The time horizon of NEMS extends to 2040. To represent regional differences in energy markets, the component modules of NEMS function at the regional level: the 9 Census divisions for the end-use demand modules; production regions specific to oil, natural gas, and coal supply and distribution; 22 regions and subregions of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation for electricity; and 9 refining regions that are a subset of the 5 Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADDs).</p>
<p> NEMS is organized and implemented as a modular system. The modules represent each of the fuel supply markets, conversion sectors, and end-use consumption sectors of the energy system. The modular design also permits the use of the methodology and level of detail most appropriate for each energy sector. NEMS executes each of the component modules to solve for prices of energy delivered to end users and the quantities consumed, by product, region, and sector. The delivered fuel prices encompass all activities necessary to produce, import, and transport fuels to end users. The information flows also include such areas as economic activity, domestic production, and international petroleum supply. NEMS calls each supply, conversion, and end-use demand module in sequence until the delivered prices of energy and the quantities demanded have converged within tolerance, thereby achieving an economic equilibrium of supply and demand in the consuming sectors. A solution is reached for each year from 2013 through 2040. Other variables, such as petroleum product imports, crude oil imports, and several macroeconomic indicators, also are evaluated for convergence.</p>
<p>Each NEMS component represents the effects and costs of legislation and environmental regulations that affect each sector. NEMS accounts for all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, as well as emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>), and mercury from the electricity generation sector.</p>
<p>The version of NEMS used for AEO2014 generally represents current legislation and environmental regulations, including recent government actions for which implementing regulations were available as of October 31, 2013, as discussed in the Legislation and Regulations section of the AEO. The potential effects of proposed federal and state legislation, regulations, or standards&#8212;or of sections of legislation that have been enacted but require funds or implementing regulations that have not been provided or specified—are not reflected in NEMS. Many of the pending provisions are examined, however, in alternative cases included in AEO2014 or in other analysis completed by EIA.</p>
<p>In general, the historical data presented with AEO2014 projections are based on various EIA publications [<a class="endnotes">2</a>]; however, data were taken from multiple sources. Historical numbers are presented for comparison only and may be estimates. Source documents should be consulted for the official data values. Footnotes to AEO2014 appendix tables indicate the definitions and sources of historical data.</p>
<p>Where possible AEO2014, which was developed during the summer of 2013, presents information for 2013 and 2014 that is consistent with the short-term projections from EIA's September 2013 <em>Short-Term Energy Outlook</em> (STEO) [<a class="endnotes">3</a>]. EIA's views regarding energy use over the 2013 through 2015 period are reported in monthly STEO updates [<a class="endnotes">4</a>], which should be considered to supersede information reported for those years in AEO2014.</p>
<h3>Component modules</h3>
<p>The component modules of NEMS represent the individual supply, demand, and conversion sectors of domestic energy markets and also include international and macroeconomic modules. In general, the modules interact through values representing prices or expenditures for energy delivered to the consuming sectors and the quantities of end-use energy consumption.</p>
<h3>Macroeconomic Activity Module</h3>
<p>The Macroeconomic Activity Module (MAM) provides a set of macroeconomic drivers to the energy modules and receives energy-related indicators from the NEMS energy components as part of the macroeconomic feedback mechanism within NEMS. Key macroeconomic variables used in the energy modules include gross domestic product (GDP), disposable income, values of industrial shipments, new housing starts, sales of new light-duty vehicles (LDVs), interest rates, and employment. Key energy indicators fed back to the MAM include aggregate energy prices and quantities. The MAM uses the following models from IHS Global Insight: Macroeconomic Model of the U.S. Economy, National Industrial Output model, and National Employment by Industry Model. In addition, EIA has constructed a Regional Economic, Industrial Output and Employment by Industry model to project regional economic drivers, and a Commercial Floorspace model to project 13 floorspace types in the nine Census divisions. The accounting framework for industrial value of shipments uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).</p>
<h3>International Energy Module</h3>
<p>The International Energy Module (IEM) uses assumptions of economic growth and expectations of future U.S. and world petroleum and other liquids production and consumption, by year, to project the interaction of U.S. and international petroleum and other liquids markets. This module provides a world crude-like liquids supply curve and generates a worldwide oil supply/demand balance for each year of the projection period. The supply-curve calculations are based on historical market data and a world oil supply/demand balance, which is developed from reduced-form models of international petroleum and other liquids supply and demand, current investment trends in exploration and development, and long-term resource economics by country and territory. The oil production estimates include both petroleum and other liquids supply recovery technologies. The IEM also provides, for each year of the projection period, endogenous assumptions for petroleum products for import and export in the United States. The IEM, through interaction with the rest of NEMS, changes North Sea Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices in response to changes in expected production and consumption of crude-like liquids in the United States.</p>
<h3>Residential and Commercial Demand Modules</h3>
<p>The Residential Demand Module projects energy consumption in the residential sector by Census division, housing type, and end use, based on delivered energy prices, the menu of equipment available, the availability of renewable sources of energy, and changes in the housing stock. The Commercial Demand Module projects energy consumption in the commercial sector by Census division, building type, and category of end use, based on delivered prices of energy, the menu of available equipment, availability of renewable sources of energy, and changes in commercial floorspace.</p>
<p>Both modules estimate the equipment stock for the major end-use services, incorporating assessments of advanced technologies, representations of renewable energy technologies, and the effects of both building shell and appliance standards. The modules also include projections of distributed generation. The Commercial Demand Module also incorporates combined heat and power (CHP) technology. Both modules incorporate projections of heating and cooling degree-days by Census division, based on a 30- year historical trend and on state-level population projections. The Residential Demand Module projects an increase in the average square footage of both new construction and existing structures, based on trends in new construction and remodeling.</p>
<h3>Industrial Demand Module</h3>
<p>The Industrial Demand Module (IDM) projects the consumption of energy for heat and power, as well as the consumption of feedstocks and raw materials in each of 21 industry groups, subject to the delivered prices of energy and macroeconomic estimates of employment and the value of shipments for each industry. As noted in the description of MAM, the representation of industrial activity in NEMS is based on the NAICS. The industries are classified into three groups—energy-intensive manufacturing, nonenergy- intensive manufacturing, and nonmanufacturing. Seven of eight energy-intensive manufacturing industries are modeled in the IDM, including energy-consuming components for boiler/steam/cogeneration, buildings, and process/assembly use of energy. Energy demand for petroleum and other liquids refining (the other energy-intensive manufacturing industry) is modeled in the Liquid Fuels Market Module (LFMM) as described below, but the projected consumption is reported under the industrial totals.</p>
<p>There are several updates and upgrades in the representations of select industries. AEO2014 includes an upgraded representation for the glass industry. Instead of assuming that technological development for a particular process occurs on a predetermined or exogenous path based on engineering judgment, these upgrades allow technological change in the glass industry to be modeled endogenously, using a more detailed process flow representation. The upgrade allows for explicit technological change, and therefore energy intensity, to respond to economic, regulatory, and other conditions. The combined cement and lime industries and aluminum industry were upgraded to process flow models in previous AEOs. The iron and steel and paper industries will be similarly upgraded in future AEOs.</p>
<p>Model input data associated with energy intensity were aligned with the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey 2010 data. In the bulk chemicals model, behavior of naphtha and ethane prices was modified to better respond to oil price cases. The cement model was modified to include multichannel burners that add flexibility for fuel mix, allowing the use of significant amounts of secondary fuels, such as alternative solid fuels including tires, plastics, wood, and waste. The model also includes more rapid penetration of energy-efficient grinding. In the food industry, shipments were categorized in more detail, to grain and oil seed milling, dairy, animal slaughter, and all other. Changes also were made to the nonmanufacturing data approach. Census, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and EIA's Fuel Oil Kerosene Sales data were used to improve projections of petroleum product and natural gas consumption in agriculture, construction, and mining. CHP use is now differentiated by region and industry, based on EIA's updated historical data.</p>
<h3>Transportation Demand Module</h3>
<p>The Transportation Demand Module projects consumption of energy by mode and fuel—including petroleum products, electricity, methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), and hydrogen—in the transportation sector, subject to delivered energy prices, macroeconomic variables such as GDP, and other factors such as technology adoption and consumer behavior. The Transportation Demand Module includes legislation and regulations—such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT2005), the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (EIEA2008), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA2009)—which contain tax credits for the purchase of alternatively fueled vehicles. Representations of LDV corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards, heavyduty vehicle (HDV) fuel consumption and GHG emissions standards, and biofuels consumption reflect standards enacted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as provisions in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA2007).</p>
<p>The air transportation component of the Transportation Demand Module represents air travel in domestic and foreign markets and includes the industry practice of parking aircraft in both domestic and international markets to reduce operating costs, as well as the movement of aging aircraft from passenger to cargo markets. For passenger travel and air freight shipments, the module represents regional fuel use and travel demand for three aircraft types: regional, narrow-body, and wide-body. An infrastructure constraint, which is also modeled, can potentially limit overall growth in passenger and freight air travel to levels commensurate with industry-projected infrastructure expansion and capacity growth.</p>
<p>The Transportation Demand Module projects energy consumption for freight and passenger rail and marine vessels by mode and fuel, subject to macroeconomic variables such as the value and type of industrial shipments. Freight ton-miles and efficiency also are projected in the model.</p>
<h3>Electricity Market Module</h3>
<p>There are three primary submodules of the Electricity Market Module (EMM)—capacity planning, fuel dispatching, and finance and pricing. The capacity expansion submodule uses the stock of existing generation capacity, known environmental regulations, the expected cost and performance of future generation capacity, expected fuel prices, expected financial parameters, and expected electricity demand to project the optimal mix of new generation capacity that should be added in future years. The fuel dispatching submodule uses the existing stock of generation equipment types, their operation and maintenance costs and performance, fuel prices to the electricity sector, electricity demand, and all applicable environmental regulations to determine the least-cost way to meet that demand. This submodule also determines transmission and pricing of electricity. The finance and pricing submodule uses capital costs, fuel costs, macroeconomic parameters, environmental regulations, and load shapes to estimate generation costs for each technology.</p>
<p>All specifically identified options promulgated by EPA for compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are explicitly represented in the capacity expansion and dispatch decisions. All financial incentives for power generation expansion and dispatch specifically identified in EPACT2005 have been implemented. Several states, primarily in the Northeast, have enacted air emission regulations for CO<sub>2</sub> that affect the electricity generation sector, and those regulations are represented in AEO2014. The AEO2014 Reference case also imposes a limit on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for specific covered sectors, including the electric power sector in California as represented in California Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). The AEO2014 Reference case leaves the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in effect after the court vacated the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in August 2012. CAIR incorporates a cap-and-trade program for annual emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and annual and seasonal emissions of NO<sub>X</sub> from fossil fuel power plants. Reductions in hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired steam electric power plants also are reflected through the inclusion of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants, finalized by EPA on December 16, 2011.</p>
<p>Although currently there is no federal legislation in place that restricts GHG emissions, regulators and the investment community have continued to push energy companies to invest in technologies that are less GHG-intensive. The trend is captured in the AEO2014 Reference case through a 3-percentage-point increase in the cost of capital when evaluating investments in new coalfired power plants, new coal-to-liquids (CTL) plants without carbon capture and storage (CCS), and pollution control retrofits.</p>
<h3>Renewable Fuels Module</h3>
<p>The Renewable Fuels Module (RFM) includes submodules representing renewable resource supply and technology input information for central-station, grid-connected electricity generation technologies, including conventional hydroelectricity, biomass (dedicated biomass plants and co-firing in existing coal plants), geothermal, landfill gas, solar thermal electricity, solar photovoltaics (PV), and both onshore and offshore wind energy. The RFM contains renewable resource supply estimates representing the regional opportunities for renewable energy development. Investment tax credits (ITCs) for renewable fuels are incorporated, as currently enacted, including a permanent 10% ITC for business investment in solar energy (thermal nonpower uses as well as power uses) and geothermal power (available only to those projects not accepting the production tax credit [PTC] for geothermal power). In addition, the module reflects the increase in the ITC to 30% for solar energy systems installed before January 1, 2017. The extension of the credit to individual homeowners under EIEA2008 is reflected in the Residential and Commercial Demand Modules.</p>
<p>PTCs for wind, geothermal, landfill gas, and some types of hydroelectric and biomass-fueled plants also are represented. They provide a credit of up to 2.3 cents/kilowatthour (kWh) for electricity produced in the first 10 years of plant operation. For AEO2014, EIA represents the expiration of the PTC that occurred at the end of 2013. However, because the expiration date reflects an underconstruction versus in-service deadline, the effective modeled eligibility deadline is extended to new wind and landfill gas plants coming online by the end of 2015, and to other eligible plants coming online by the end of 2016. AEO2014 also accounts for new renewable energy capacity resulting from state renewable portfolio standard programs, mandates, and goals, as described in Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2014 [<a class="endnotes">5</a>].</p>
<h3>Oil and Gas Supply Module</h3>
<p>The Oil and Gas Supply Module represents domestic crude oil and natural gas supply within an integrated framework that captures the interrelationships among the various sources of supply&#8212;onshore, offshore, and Alaska&#8212;by all production techniques, including natural gas recovery from coalbeds and low-permeability geologic formations. The framework analyzes cash flow and profitability to compute investment and drilling for each of the supply sources, based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas, the domestic recoverable resource base, and the state of technology. Oil and natural gas production activities are modeled for 12 supply regions, including six onshore, three offshore, and in three Alaska regions.</p>
<p>The Onshore Lower 48 Oil and Gas Supply Submodule evaluates the economics of future exploration and development projects for crude oil and natural gas plays. Crude oil resources include structurally reservoired resources (i.e., conventional) as well as highly fractured continuous zones, such as the Austin Chalk and Bakken shale formations. Production potential from advanced secondary recovery techniques (such as infill drilling, horizontal continuity, and horizontal profile) and enhanced oil recovery (such as CO<sub>2</sub> flooding, steam flooding, polymer flooding, and profile modification) are explicitly represented. Natural gas resources include highpermeability carbonate and sandstone, tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane.</p>
<p>Domestic crude oil production volumes are used as inputs to the LFMM for conversion and blending into refined petroleum products. Supply curves for natural gas are used as inputs to the Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution Module (NGTDM) for determining natural gas wellhead prices and domestic production.</p>
<h3>Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution Module</h3>
<p>The NGTDM represents the transmission, distribution, and pricing of natural gas, subject to end-use demand for natural gas and the availability of domestic natural gas and natural gas traded on the international market. The module balances natural gas supply and demand, tracks the flows of natural gas, and determines the associated capacity expansion requirements in an aggregate pipeline network, connecting domestic and limited foreign supply sources with 12 lower 48 states regions. The 12 lower 48 states regions align with the nine Census divisions, with three subdivided, and Alaska handled separately. The flow of natural gas is determined for both a peak and off-peak period in the year, assuming a historically based seasonal distribution of natural gas demand. Key components of pipeline and distributor tariffs are included in separate pricing algorithms. The primary outputs of the module are delivered natural gas prices by region and sector, supply prices, and realized domestic natural gas production. The module also projects natural gas pipeline imports and exports to Canada and Mexico, as well as LNG imports and exports.</p>
<h3>Liquid Fuels Market Module</h3>
<p>The LFMM projects prices of petroleum products, crude oil and product import/export activity, and domestic refinery operations, subject to demand for petroleum products, availability and price of imported petroleum, environmental regulations, and domestic production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and biofuels&#8212;ethanol, biodiesel, biomass-to-liquids (BTL), CTL, gas-to-liquids (GTL), and coal-and-biomass-to-liquids (CBTL). Costs, performance, and first dates of commercial availability for the advanced liquid fuels technologies [<a class="endnotes">6</a>] are reviewed and updated annually.</p>
<p>The module represents refining activities in eight U.S. regions, and a new Maritime Canada/Caribbean refining region (created to represent short-haul international refineries that predominantly serve U.S. markets). In order to better represent policy, import/ export patterns, and biofuels production, the eight U.S. regions are defined by subdividing three of the five U.S. PADDs. All nine refining regions are defined below:</p>
<p>Region 1. PADD I – East Coast<br />
  Region 2. PADD II – Interior<br />
  Region 3. PADD II – Great Lakes<br />
  Region 4. PADD III – Gulf Coast<br />
  Region 5. PADD III – Interior<br />
  Region 6. PADD IV – Mountain<br />
  Region 7. PADD V – California<br />
  Region 8. PADD V – Other<br />
  Region 9. Maritime Canada/Caribbean.</p>
<p>The LFMM models the costs of automotive fuels, such as conventional and reformulated gasoline, and includes production of biofuels for blending in gasoline and diesel. Fuel ethanol and biodiesel are included in the LFMM because they are commonly blended into petroleum products. The module allows ethanol blending into gasoline at 10% by volume (E10), 15% by volume (E15) in states that lack explicit language capping ethanol volume or oxygen content, and up to 85% by volume (E85) for use in flex-fuel vehicles. The module also includes a 16% by volume biobutanol/gasoline blend. Crude oil and refinery product imports are represented by supply curves defined by the NEMS IEM. Products also can be imported from refining region nine (Maritime Canada/Caribbean). Refinery product exports are represented by demand curves, also provided by the IEM.</p>
<p>Capacity expansion of refinery process units and nonpetroleum liquid fuels production facilities is also modeled in the LFMM. The model uses current liquid fuels production capacity, the cost and performance of each production unit, expected fuel and feedstock costs, expected financial parameters, expected liquid fuels demand, and relevant environmental policies to project the optimal mix of new capacity that should be added in the future.</p>
<p>The LFMM includes representation of the renewable fuels standard (RFS) specified in EISA2007, which mandates the use of 36 billion gallons of ethanol equivalent renewable fuel by 2022. Both domestic and imported biofuels count toward the RFS. Domestic ethanol production is modeled for three feedstock categories: corn, cellulosic plant materials, and advanced feedstock materials. Starch-based ethanol plants are numerous (more than 175 are now in operation, with a total maximum sustainable nameplate capacity of more than 13 billion gallons annually), and are based on a well-known technology that converts starch and sugar into ethanol. Ethanol from cellulosic sources is a new technology with only a few small pilot plants in operation. Ethanol from advanced feedstocks&#8212;produced at ethanol refineries that ferment and distill grains other than corn, and reduce GHG emissions by at least 50%&#8212;is another new technology modeled in the LFMM. The LFMM also has the capability to produce biobutanol from a retrofitted corn ethanol facility, if economically competitive.</p>
<p>Fuels produced by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and through a pyrolysis process are also modeled in the LFMM, based on their economics compared with competing feedstocks and products. The five processes modeled are CTL, CBTL, GTL, BTL, and pyrolysis.</p>
<p>Two California-specific policies are also represented in the LFMM: the low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) and the AB 32 cap-andtrade program. The LCFS requires the carbon intensity (amount of greenhouse gases/unit of energy) of transportation fuels sold for use in California to decrease according to a schedule published by the California Air Resources Board. California's AB 32 cap-andtrade program is established to help California achieve its goal of reducing CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Working with other NEMS modules (IDM, EMM, and Emissions Policy Module), the LFMM provides emissions allowances and actual emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from California refineries, and NEMS provides the mechanism (carbon price) to trade allowances such that the total CO2 emissions cap is met.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Module</h3>
<p>The Coal Market Module (CMM) simulates mining, transportation, and pricing of coal, subject to end-use demand for coal differentiated by heat and sulfur content. U.S. coal production is represented in the CMM by 41 separate supply curves&#8212;differentiated by region, mine type, coal rank, and sulfur content. The coal supply curves respond to mining capacity, capacity utilization of mines, labor productivity, and factor input costs (mining equipment, mining labor, and fuel requirements). Projections of U.S. coal distribution are determined by minimizing the cost of coal supplied, given coal demands by region and sector; environmental restrictions; and accounting for minemouth prices, transportation costs, and coal supply contracts. Over the projection horizon, coal transportation costs in the CMM vary in response to changes in the cost of rail investments.</p>
<p>The CMM produces projections of U.S. steam and metallurgical coal exports and imports in the context of world coal trade, determining the pattern of world coal trade flows that minimizes production and transportation costs while meeting a specified set of regional coal import demands, subject to constraints on export capacities and trade flows. The international coal market component of the module computes trade in two types of coal (steam and metallurgical) for 17 export regions and 20 import regions. U.S. coal production and distribution are computed for 14 supply regions and 16 demand regions.</p>
<h3>Annual Energy Outlook 2014 cases</h3>
<p>Table E1 provides a summary of the cases produced as part of AEO2014. For each case, the table gives the name used in AEO2014, a brief description of the major assumptions underlying the projections, and a reference to the pages in the body of the report and in this appendix where the case is discussed. The text sections following Table E1 describe the various cases in more detail. The Reference case assumptions for each sector are described in Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2014 [<a class="endnotes">7</a>]. Regional results and other details of the projections are available at <a href="../../../forecasts/aeo/tables_ref.cfm.html#supplement">http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/tables_ref.cfm#supplement</a>.</p>
<h3>Macroeconomic growth cases</h3>
<p> In addition to the AEO2014 Reference case, Low Economic Growth and High Economic Growth cases were developed to reflect the uncertainty in projections of economic growth. The alternative cases are intended to show the effects of alternative growth assumptions on energy market projections. The cases are described as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Reference case, population grows by 0.7%/year, nonfarm employment by 0.8%/year, and labor productivity by 1.8%/ year from 2012 to 2040. Economic output as measured by real GDP increases by 2.4%/year from 2012 through 2040, and growth in real disposable income per capita averages 1.7%/year.</li>
  </ul>

<ul>
  <li>The Low Economic Growth case assumes lower growth rates for population (0.6%/year) and labor productivity (1.4%/year), resulting in lower nonfarm employment (0.7%/year), higher prices and interest rates, and lower growth in industrial output. In the Low Economic Growth case, economic output as measured by real GDP increases by 1.9%/year from 2012 through 2040, and growth in real disposable income per capita averages 1.3%/year.</li>
  <li>The High Economic Growth case assumes higher growth rates for population (0.8%/year) and labor productivity (2.0%/year), resulting in higher nonfarm employment (1.0%/year). With higher productivity gains and employment growth, inflation and interest rates are lower than in the Reference case, and consequently economic output grows at a higher rate (2.8%/year) than in the Reference case (2.4%). Disposable income per capita grows by 1.7%/year, the same as in the Reference case.</li>
  </ul>  
<h3>Oil price cases</h3>
<p>The benchmark oil price is the price for Brent crude oil, which better reflects the marginal price paid by refineries for imported light, sweet crude oil used to produce petroleum products for consumers. EIA continues to report the WTI price and the Imported Refiner Acquisition Cost.</p>
<p>The historical record shows substantial variability in oil prices, and there is arguably even more uncertainty about future prices in the long term. AEO2014 considers three oil price cases (Reference, Low Oil Price, and High Oil Price) to allow an assessment of alternative views on the future course of oil prices.</p>
<p>The Low and High Oil Price cases reflect a wide range of potential price paths, resulting primarily from variation in demand for petroleum and other liquid fuels in non-OECD countries due to different levels of economic growth. The Low and High Oil Price cases also reflect different assumptions about decisions by members of OPEC regarding the preferred rate of oil production and about the future finding and development costs and accessibility of non-OPEC oil resources.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Reference case, real oil prices (in 2012 dollars) rise from $112/barrel in 2012 to $141/barrel in 2040. The Reference case represents EIA's current judgment regarding exploration and development costs and accessibility of oil resources. Compared with AEO2013, EIA sees increasing production from non-OPEC countries, particularly the United States. However, EIA also assumes that OPEC producers will choose to maintain their share of the market and will schedule investments in incremental production capacity so that OPEC oil production will represent between 39% and 44% of the world's total petroleum and other liquids production over the projection period.</li>
  <li>In the Low Oil Price case, crude oil prices fall to $70/barrel (2012 dollars) in 2016, remain below $70/barrel through 2023, and stay below $75/barrel through 2040. The low price results from lower costs of production and lower demand from China and the Middle East compared with the Reference case. Crude oil production from across OPEC rises throughout the projection period in this case, displacing more expensive crude projected in the Reference case (including from the United States). Correspondingly, OPEC's market share of petroleum rises steadily from 40% through 2015 to almost 53% in 2040. In addition, in this case, bitumen production in Canada and renewable fuels from Brazil and the United States see decreases in costs, leading to increased production. This keeps the OPEC market share to between 39% and 50% of the total liquids market. With the exceptions of China and the Middle East, which see reduced economic growth in this case, the lower prices generally lead to higher demand than projected in the Reference case.</li>
  <li>In the High Oil Price case, oil prices reach about $204/barrel (2012 dollars) in 2040. The high prices result primarily from higher costs of petroleum supply. Fewer structurally reservoired crude oil supplies are developed than in the Reference case, leading to increased development of more costly resources, including tight oil and bitumen. Higher prices also lead to significant increases in renewable liquid fuels and coal-to-liquid products as compared with the Reference case. In this case, OPEC's share of world liquids production never exceeds the high of 40% that it reaches in 2013 and drops as low as 37%. The higher supply costs depress demand globally through 2028, but stronger growth in non-OECD countries than is projected in the Reference case leads to higher demand than in the Reference case, starting in these countries in 2029, and starting globally in 2037.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Buildings sector cases</h3>
<p>In addition to the AEO2014 Reference case, three technology-focused cases using the NEMS Demand Modules were developed to examine the effects of changes in technology. Residential sector assumptions for the technology-focused cases are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Integrated 2013 Demand Technology case assumes that all future residential equipment purchases are limited to the range of equipment available in 2013. Existing building shell efficiencies are assumed to be fixed at 2013 levels (no further improvements). For new construction, building shell assumptions are the same as in the Reference case.</li>
  <li>The Integrated High Demand Technology case assumes that residential advanced equipment is available earlier, at lower costs, and/or at higher efficiencies [<a class="endnotes">8</a>]. Existing building shell efficiencies exhibit 50% more improvement than in the Reference case after 2013. For new construction, building code compliance is assumed to improve after 2013, and building shell efficiencies are assumed to meet ENERGY STAR requirements by 2023. Consumers evaluate investments in energy efficiency at a 7% real discount rate.</li>
  <li>The Integrated Best Available Demand Technology case assumes that all future residential equipment purchases are made from a menu of technologies that includes only the most efficient models available in a particular year for each technology class, regardless of cost. Existing building shell efficiencies have twice the improvement of the Reference case after 2013. For new construction, 100% compliance with building codes is assumed, and building shell efficiencies are assumed to meet the criteria for the most efficient components after 2013. Consumers evaluate investments in energy efficiency at a 7% real discount rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial sector assumptions for the technology-focused cases are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Integrated 2013 Demand Technology case assumes that all future commercial equipment purchases are limited to the range of equipment available in 2013. Building shell efficiencies are assumed to be fixed at 2013 levels.</li>
  <li>The Integrated High Demand Technology case assumes that commercial advanced equipment is available earlier, at lower costs, and/or with higher efficiencies than in the Reference case. Energy efficiency investments are evaluated at a 7% real discount rate. For new and existing buildings in 2040, building shell efficiencies are assumed to show 25% more improvement than in the Reference case.</li>
  <li>The Integrated Best Available Demand Technology case assumes that all future commercial equipment purchases are made from a menu of technologies that includes only the most efficient models available in a particular year for each technology class, regardless of cost. Energy efficiency investments are evaluated at a 7% real discount rate. For new and existing buildings in 2040, building shell efficiencies are assumed to show 50% more improvement than in the Reference case.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Residential and Commercial Demand Modules of NEMS were also used to complete the Low Renewable Technology Cost case, which is discussed in more detail in the renewable fuels cases section. In combination with assumptions for electricity generation from renewable fuels in the electric power sector and industrial sector, this sensitivity case analyzes the impacts of changes in generating technologies that use renewable fuels and in the availability of renewable energy sources. For the Residential and Commercial Demand Modules: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Low Renewable Technology Cost case assumes greater improvements in residential and commercial PV and wind systems than in the Reference case. The assumptions for capital cost estimates are 20% below Reference case assumptions from 2014 through 2040.</li>
</ul>
<p>The No Sunset and Extended Policies cases described below in the cross-cutting integrated cases discussion also include assumptions in the Residential and Commercial Demand Modules of NEMS. The Extended Policies case builds on the No Sunset case and adds multiple rounds of appliance standards and building codes as described below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The No Sunset case assumes that selected federal policies with sunset provisions will be extended indefinitely rather than allowed to sunset as the law currently prescribes. For the residential sector, these extensions include personal tax credits for PV installations, solar water heaters, small wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps, as well as tax credits for energy-efficient homes and selected residential appliances. For the commercial sector, business ITC for PV installations, solar water heaters, small wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and CHP are extended to the end of the projection. The business tax credit for solar technologies remains at the current 30% level without reverting to 10% as scheduled.</li>
  <li>The Extended Policies case includes updates to federal appliance standards, as prescribed by the timeline in DOE's multiyear plan, and introduces new standards for products currently not covered by DOE. Efficiency levels for the updated residential appliance standards are based on current ENERGY STAR guidelines. End-use technologies eligible for No Sunset incentives are not subject to new standards. Efficiency levels for updated commercial equipment standards are based on the technology menu from the AEO2014 Reference case and purchasing specifications for federal agencies designated by the Federal Energy Management Program. The case also adds two additional rounds of improved national building codes with full implementation in 2023 and 2029.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrial sector cases<br />
</h3>
<p>In addition to the AEO2014 Reference case, two technology-focused cases developed using the IDM of NEMS examine the effects of less rapid and more rapid technology change and adoption. The energy intensity changes discussed in this section exclude the refining industry, which is modeled separately from the IDM in the LFMM. Different assumptions for the IDM were also used as part of the Integrated Low Renewable Technology Cost case, No Sunset case, and Extended Policies case, but each is structured on a set of the initial industrial assumptions used for the Integrated 2013 Demand Technology case and Integrated High Demand Technology case. For the industrial sector, assumptions for the two technology-focused cases are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the Integrated 2013 Demand Technology case, the energy efficiency of new industrial plant and equipment is held constant at the 2014 level over the projection period. Changes in aggregate energy intensity may result both from changing equipment and production efficiency and from changing the composition of output within an individual industry. Because all AEO2014 side cases are integrated runs, potential feedback effects from energy market interactions are captured. Therefore, the level and composition of overall industrial output varies from the Reference case, and any change in energy intensity in the two technology side cases is attributable to process and efficiency changes and increased use of CHP, as well as changes in the level and composition of overall industrial output.</li>
  <li>For the Integrated High Demand Technology case, the IDM assumes earlier availability, lower costs, and higher efficiency for more advanced equipment [<a class="endnotes">9</a>] and a more rapid rate of improvement in the recovery of biomass byproducts from industrial processes&#8212;i.e., 0.7%/year as compared with 0.4%/year in the Reference case. The same assumption is incorporated in the Low Renewable Technology Cost case, which focuses on electricity generation. Although the choice of the 0.7% annual rate of improvement in byproduct recovery is an assumption in the High Demand Technology case, it is based on the expectation of higher recovery rates and substantially increased use of CHP in that case. Due to integration with other NEMS modules, potential feedback effects from energy market interactions are captured.</li>
</ul>
<p>The No Sunset and Extended Policies cases described below in the cross-cutting integrated cases discussion also include assumptions in the IDM of NEMS. The Extended Policies case builds on the No Sunset case and modifies selected industrial assumptions as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The No Sunset case and Extended Policies case include an assumption for CHP that extends the existing ITC for industrial CHP through the end of the projection period. Additionally, the Extended Policies case includes an increase in the capacity limitations on the ITC by increasing the cap on CHP equipment from 15 megawatts (MW) to 25 MW and eliminating the system-wide cap of 50 MW. These assumptions are based on the proposals made in H.R. 2750 and H.R. 2784 of the 112th Congress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transportation sector cases</h3>
<p>In addition to the AEO2014 Reference case, the NEMS Transportation Demand Module was used as part of six AEO2014 side cases.</p>
<p>The Transportation Demand Module was used to examine the effects of advanced technology costs and efficiency improvement for technology adoption and vehicle fuel economy as part of the Integrated High Demand Technology case. For the Integrated High Demand Technology case, the characteristics of conventional and alternative-fuel LDVs reflect more optimistic assumptions about incremental improvements in fuel economy and costs, including battery electric systems. In the freight truck sector, the Integrated High Demand Technology case assumes more rapid incremental improvement in fuel efficiency. More optimistic assumptions for fuel efficiency improvements are also made for the air, rail, and shipping sectors.</p>
<p>The Transportation Demand Module was used to examine the effects of an extension to the LDV GHG Emissions and CAFE Standards beyond 2025 as part of the Extended Policies case. The joint EPA and NHTSA CAFE Standards were increased after 2025, at an average annual rate of 1.3% through 2040, reaching a combined average LDV fuel economy compliance of 55.7 miles/gallon in 2040. As part of the Extended Policies case, the Transportation Demand Module was also used to examine the effects of extending and enhancing the HDV fuel consumption and GHG emissions standards through 2040. The regulations are currently specified for model year (MY) 2014 to MY 2018. The Extended Policies case includes a modest increase in fuel consumption and GHG emissions standards for 13 HDV vehicle size classes.</p>
<p>Assumptions in the NEMS Transportation Demand Module were modified for the High Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and Low VMT cases. These cases examine the effects of changes to licensing rates and VMT on the LDV transportation sector. The High VMT case includes assumptions for increases in VMT per licensed driver for the five VMT age cohorts. VMT per licensed driver is 3% higher than in the Reference case in 2012, increases to 7% above the Reference case in 2027, and decreases back to 3% above the Reference case by 2040. The Low VMT case includes assumptions for a decline in licensed drivers for the 13 gender/ age cohorts, as well as decreases in VMT per licensed driver for the five VMT age groups. VMT per licensed driver are 5% lower than in the Reference case for the entire projection, and the licensing rates either stay constant at 2011 levels for all age cohorts or decline as portrayed in the Reference case.</p>
<p>The Transportation Demand Module was also used to examine the effect of varying LNG locomotive penetration in the freight rail sector. The High Rail LNG case allows for LNG locomotives to penetrate the rail sector fully by 2037. The Low Rail LNG case incorporates dual-fuel engines that utilize LNG up to 80%, with an LNG locomotive penetration rate at 1.0% of the average annual stock turnover.</p>
<h3>Electricity sector cases</h3>
<p>In addition to the Reference case, several integrated cases with alternative electric power assumptions were developed to support discussions in the Market Trends and Issues in Focus sections of AEO2014. Three alternative cases were run to examine the impacts on the electric power sector of potentially large retirements of baseload coal and nuclear plants. In recent years, a combination of low natural gas prices, high retrofit or repair costs, and uncertainty about environmental legislation have led to an increase in announced retirements of coal and nuclear plants. The Issues in Focus article, &quot;Implications of accelerated power plant retirements,&quot; discusses the factors influencing those retirement decisions, using the analysis cases to illustrate potential impacts. Two additional cases for nuclear power plants were developed to address uncertainties about the operating lives of existing reactors and the potential for new nuclear capacity and for capacity uprates at existing plants.</p>
<p>A final case combines technology and efficiency improvements across the end-use demand sectors to create a case that projects relatively low growth in total electricity consumption. The Issues in Focus article, &quot;Implications of low electricity demand growth,&quot; analyzes the impacts on power sector capacity and generation requirements under a scenario of low demand growth.</p>
<h3>Accelerated Retirement cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Accelerated Nuclear Retirement case assumes that reactors will not receive second license renewals, so that all existing nuclear plants are retired within 60 years after beginning operation. The 4.8 GW of announced retirements remain as in the Reference case, along with the decrease of 5.7 GW of nuclear capacity by 2020 to reflect plants at risk of early closure in specific regions. In the Reference case, after 2020, existing plants are assumed to run as long as they continue to be economic, implicitly assuming that a second 20-year license renewal will occur for most plants that reach 60 years of operation before 2040. In the Accelerated Nuclear Retirement case, an additional 37 GW of nuclear capacity is retired by 2040. The Accelerated Nuclear Retirement case also assumes that no new nuclear capacity is added throughout the projection, excluding capacity already planned and under construction. It assumes that only those capacity uprates already reported to EIA (0.7 GW) are completed, as in the Reference case, and that nonfuel operating costs at existing nuclear plants increase by 3%/year after 2013.</li>
  <li>The Accelerated Coal Retirement case includes the assumptions used for the High Coal Cost case, including lower productivity and higher costs associated with mining and coal transportation rates. In 2040, delivered coal prices are more than 60% higher in the Accelerated Coal Retirement case than in the Reference case. This case also assumes that non-fuel operating costs at existing coal plants increase by 3%/year after 2013.</li>
  <li>The Accelerated Coal and Nuclear Retirement case combines the assumptions of the Accelerated Coal Retirement and Accelerated Nuclear Retirement cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nuclear cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Low Nuclear case combines the Accelerated Nuclear Retirement case with the High Oil and Gas Resource case and the No Sunset case. This combines more pessimistic assumptions for nuclear costs and lifetimes with more favorable conditions for natural gas-fired and renewable technologies, so that the impacts on the power sector can be viewed under an outlook where output from nuclear power is greatly reduced.</li>
  <li>The High Nuclear case was run to provide a more optimistic outlook, with all nuclear power plant licenses renewed and all plants continuing to operate economically beyond 60 years (excluding the 4.8 GW of announced retirements). The High Nuclear case also assumes that additional planned nuclear capacity is completed, based on combined license applications (COL) issued by the NRC and whether an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board hearing has been scheduled for a COL. The High Nuclear case assumes 12.6 GW of planned capacity additions, as compared with 5.5 GW of planned capacity additions assumed in the Reference case. Finally, the High Nuclear case assumes a total of 6.0 GW of uprates at existing plants, reflecting an assumption that most plants with remaining uprate potential will elect to perform such uprates.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Low Electricity Demand case</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Low Electricity Demand case uses the assumptions in the Best Available Demand Technology case for the residential and commercial sectors. In addition, input values for the industrial sector motor model are adjusted to increase system savings values for pumps, fans, and air compressors relative to the Reference case. This adjustment lowers total motor electricity consumption by slightly less than 20%. Although technically plausible, this decrease in motor adjustment is not intended to be a likely representation of motor development. As a result of these changes across the end-use sectors, retail sales in 2040 in this case are roughly the same as in 2012.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Renewable fuels cases</h3>
<p>In addition to the AEO2014 Reference case, EIA developed a case with alternative assumptions about renewable generation technologies and policies to examine the effects of more aggressive improvement in the costs of renewable technologies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Low Renewable Technology Cost case, the capital costs of new non-hydro renewable generating technologies are assumed to be 20% below Reference case assumptions from 2014 through 2040. In general, lower costs are represented by reducing the capital costs of new plant construction. Biomass fuel supplies also are assumed to be 20% less expensive than in the Reference case for the same resource quantities. Assumptions for other generating technologies are unchanged from those in the Reference case. In the Low Renewable Technology Cost case, the rate of improvement in recovery of biomass byproducts from industrial processes also is increased. Capital costs for new ethanol, biodiesel, pyrolysis, and other BTL production technologies also are 20% lower than Reference case levels through 2040.</li>
  <li>In the No Sunset case and the Extended Policies case, expiring federal tax credits targeting renewable electricity are assumed to be permanently extended. This applies to the PTC, which is a tax credit of 2.3 cents/kWh (adjusted annually for inflation) available for the first 10 years of production by new generators using wind, geothermal, and certain biomass fuels, or a tax credit of 1.1 cents/kWh available for the first 10 years of production by new generators using geothermal energy, certain hydroelectric technologies, and biomass fuels not eligible for the full credit of 2.3 cents/kWh. The extension also applies to the 30% ITC for new generators using solar energy, which may also be claimed in lieu of the PTC for eligible technologies.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Oil and natural gas supply cases</h3>
<p>The sensitivity of the AEO2014 projections to changes in assumptions regarding technically recoverable domestic crude oil and natural gas resources is examined in two cases. These cases do not represent a confidence interval for future domestic oil and natural gas supply, but rather provide a framework to examine the effects of higher and lower domestic supply on energy demand, imports, and prices. Assumptions associated with these cases are described below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Low Oil and Gas Resource case, the estimated ultimate recovery per tight oil, tight gas, or shale gas well is assumed to be 50% lower than in the Reference case, increasing the per-unit cost of developing the resource. The total unproved technically recoverable resource of crude oil is decreased to 180 billion barrels, and the natural gas resource is decreased to 1,480 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), as compared with unproved resource estimates of 209 billion barrels of crude oil and 1,932 Tcf of natural gas as of January 1, 2012, in the Reference case.</li>
  <li>In the High Oil and Gas Resource case, the resource assumptions are adjusted to allow a continued increase in domestic crude oil production, to more than 13 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d) in 2040 compared with 7.5 MMbbl/d in the Reference case. This case includes: (1) 50% higher estimated ultimate recovery per tight oil, tight gas, or shale gas well, with 50% lower acre spacing (minimum 40 acres) than in the Reference case, as well as additional unidentified tight oil resources to reflect the possibility that additional layers or new areas of low-permeability zones will be identified and developed; (2) diminishing returns on the estimated ultimate recovery once drilling levels in a county exceed the number of potential wells assumed in the Reference case to reflect well interference at greater drilling density; (3) additional 1% annual increase in the estimated ultimate recovery for tight oil, tight gas, and shale gas wells due to faster technological improvement; (4) kerogen development reaching 135,000 barrels/day in 2024; (5) tight oil development in Alaska, increasing the total Alaska technically recoverable resource by 1.9 billion barrels; and (6) 50% higher technically recoverable undiscovered resources in Alaska, the offshore lower 48 states, and shale gas in Canada than in the Reference case. Additionally, a few offshore Alaska fields are assumed to be discovered and developed earlier than in the Reference case. The total unproved technically recoverable resource of crude oil increases to 401 billion barrels, and the natural gas resource increases to 3,349 Tcf as compared with unproved resource estimates of 209 billion barrels of crude oil and 1,932 Tcf of natural gas in the Reference case as of the start of 2012.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Liquids market cases</h3>
<p>The Liquid Fuels Market Module of NEMS was used (with other NEMS models) to complete the Low Renewable Technology Cost case, which is discussed in more detail in the renewable fuels cases section. In addition to the 20% reduction in nonhydro renewable generating technologies, 20% reduction in biomass feedstock costs, and higher rate of recovery for biomass byproducts from industrial processes, the LFMM assumes capital costs for new ethanol, biodiesel, pyrolysis, and other BTL technologies are 20% lower than reference case levels through 2040.</p>
<p>Some assumptions in the LFMM were changed to support the No Sunset case by extending the ethanol and biodiesel subsidies beyond their current end dates (2013). This assumption was excluded from the Extended Policies case.</p>
<h3>Coal market cases</h3>
<p>Two alternative coal cost cases examine the impacts on U.S. coal supply, demand, distribution, and prices that result from alternative assumptions about mining productivity, labor costs, mine equipment costs, coal transportation rates, and costs of non-U.S. coal supplies to international markets. The alternative productivity and cost assumptions are applied in every year from 2014 through 2040. For the coal cost cases, adjustments to the Reference case assumptions for coal mining productivity are based on variation in the average annual productivity growth of 2.4 percentage points observed since 2000 for mines in Wyoming's Powder River Basin and 2.3 percentage points for other coal-producing regions. Transportation rates are lowered (in the Low Coal Cost case) or raised (in the High Coal Cost case) from Reference case levels to achieve a 25% change in rates relative to the Reference case in 2040. In both the High and Low Coal Cost cases, price trends for non-U.S. coal export supplies (e.g., coal exported to international markets from ports in Australia or Southern Africa, a NEMS-defined region that includes South Africa, Mozambique, and Botswana) are assumed to be similar, but price changes are approximately 10% less than the price changes projected for U.S. coal exports. The Low and High Coal Cost cases represent fully integrated NEMS runs, with feedback from the macroeconomic activity, international, supply, conversion, and end-use demand modules.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Low Coal Cost case, the average annual growth rates for coal mining productivity are higher than those in the Reference case and are applied at the supply curve level. As an example, the average annual productivity growth rate for Wyoming's Southern Powder River Basin supply curve is increased from -1.5% in the Reference case for the years 2014 through 2040 to 0.9% in the Low Coal Cost case. Coal miner wages, mine equipment costs, and other mine supply costs all are assumed to be about 24% lower in 2040 in real terms in the Low Coal Cost case than in the Reference case. Coal transportation rates, excluding the impact of fuel surcharges, are assumed to be 25% lower in 2040. In the international coal market, the price change for non-U.S. export supplies is assumed to be roughly 10% less than the price change projected for U.S. coal exports.</li>
  <li>In the High Coal Cost case, the average annual productivity growth rates for coal mining are lower than those in the Reference case and are applied as described in the Low Coal Cost case. Coal miner wages, mine equipment costs, and other mine supply costs in 2040 are assumed to be about 31% higher than in the Reference case, and coal transportation rates in 2040 are assumed to be 25% higher. In the international coal market, the price change for non-U.S. export supplies is assumed to be roughly 10% less than the price change projected for U.S. coal exports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional data on productivity, wage, mine equipment cost, and coal transportation rate assumptions for the Reference and alternative coal cost cases are included in Appendix D.</p>
<h3>Cross-cutting integrated cases</h3>
<p>A series of cross-cutting integrated cases are used in AEO2014 to analyze specific cases with broader sectoral impacts. For example, three integrated technology progress cases analyze the effects of faster and slower technology improvement in the demand sectors (partially described in the sector-specific sections above). In addition, four cases were run with alternative assumptions about expectations for future regulation of GHG emissions.</p>
<h4><strong>Integrated technology cases</strong></h4>
<p>In the demand sectors (residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation), technology improvement typically means greater efficiency and/or reduced technology cost. Three alternative demand technology cases&#8212;Integrated 2013 Demand Technology, Integrated Best Available Demand Technology, and Integrated High Demand Technology&#8212;are used in AEO2014 to examine the potential effects of variation in the rate of technology improvement in the end-use demand sectors, independent of any offsetting effects of variations in technology improvement in the supply/conversion sectors. Assumptions for each end-use sector are described in the sector-specific sections above.</p>
<h4>No Sunset case</h4>
<p>In addition to the AEO2014 Reference case, a No Sunset case was run, assuming the extension of all existing tax credits and policies that contain sunset provisions, except those requiring additional funding (e.g., loan guarantee programs) and those that involve extensive regulatory analysis, such as CAFE improvements and periodic updates of efficiency standards. The No Sunset case also includes extension of the $1.01/gallon ethanol subsidy and $1.00/gallon biodiesel subsidy to the end of the projection period. Specific assumptions for each end-use sector and for renewables are described in the sector-specific sections above.</p>
<h4>Extended Policies case</h4>
<p>The Extended Policies case begins with the No Sunset case described above but excludes extension of the ethanol and biofuel subsidies included in the No Sunset case, because the RFS program already included in the AEO2014 Reference case tends to determine the levels of ethanol and biodiesel use. The Extended Policies case assumes an increase in the capacity limitations on the ITC and extension of the program. It includes additional rounds of federal efficiency standards for residential and commercial products, as well as new standards for products not yet covered; adds multiple rounds of national building codes by 2029; and increases LDV and HDV fuel economy standards in the transportation sector. Specific assumptions for each end-use sector and for renewables are described in the sector-specific sections above.</p>
<h4>Greenhouse gas cases</h4>
<p>Given concerns about climate change and possible future policy actions to limit GHG emissions, regulators and the investment community are beginning to push energy companies to invest in technologies that are less GHG-intensive. To reflect the market's current reaction to potential future GHG regulation, a 3-percentage-point increase in the cost of capital is assumed for investments in new coal-fired power and CTL plants without CCS and for all capital investment projects (excluding CCS) at existing coal-fired power plants in the Reference case and all other AEO2014 cases except the No GHG Concern case, GHG10 case, GHG25 case, and GHG10 and Low Gas Prices case. Those assumptions affect cost evaluations for the construction of new capacity but not the actual operating costs when a new plant begins operation.</p>
<p>The four alternative GHG cases are used to provide a range of potential outcomes, from no concern about future GHG legislation to the imposition of a specific economywide carbon emissions price, as well as an examination of the impact of a combination of a specific economywide carbon emission price and low natural gas price. AEO2014 includes three economywide CO2 price cases— two levels of carbon prices and one case combined with an alternative natural gas price projection. In the GHG10 case and the GHG10 and Low Gas Prices case, the price of carbon emissions is set at $10/metric ton of CO2 in 2015. In the GHG25 case, the price is set at $25/metric ton of CO2 in 2015. In all cases, the price begins to rise in 2016 at 5%/year. The GHG10 case and the GHG25 case use the Reference case assumptions regarding oil and natural gas resource availability. The GHG10 and Low Gas Prices case uses the assumptions from the High Oil and Gas Resource case, as described above in the Oil and natural gas supply section. The GHG cases are intended to measure the sensitivity of the AEO2014 projections to a range of implicit or explicit valuations of CO2 emissions. At the time AEO2014 was completed, no legislation including a GHG price was pending; however, the EPA is developing technology-based CO2 standards for new coal-fired power plants. In the GHG cases for AEO2014, no assumptions are made with regard to offsets, policies to promote CCS, or specific policies to mitigate impacts in selected sectors.</p>
<p> The No GHG Concern case was run without any adjustment for concern about potential GHG regulations (without the 3-percentage point increase in the cost of capital). In the No GHG Concern case, the same cost of capital is used to evaluate all new capacity builds, regardless of type.</p>
