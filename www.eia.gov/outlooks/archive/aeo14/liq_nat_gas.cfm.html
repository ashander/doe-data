      <h1>Potential of liquefied natural gas use as a railroad fuel</h1>

<img src="images/railroads_trends.jpg" />
<p>Continued growth in domestic natural gas production, along with substantially lower natural gas spot prices compared to crude
  oil, is reshaping the U.S. energy economy and attracting considerable interest in the potential for fueling freight locomotives with
  liquefied natural gas (LNG). While there is significant appeal for major U.S. railroads to use LNG as a fuel for locomotives because
  of its potentially favorable economics compared with diesel fuel, there are also key uncertainties as to whether, and to what
  extent, the railroads can take advantage of this relatively cheap and abundant fuel.</p>
<h2>Freight railroads and the basic economics of fuel choice</h2>
<p>Major U.S. railroads, known commonly as Class 1 railroads, are defined as line-haul freight railroads with certain minimum annual
  operating revenue. Currently, that classification is based on 2011 operating revenue of $433.2 million or more [<a class="endnotes">1</a>]. While there are
  561 freight railroads operating in the United States, only seven are defined as Class 1 railroads. The Class 1 railroads account for
  94% of total freight rail revenue [<a class="endnotes">2</a>]. They haul large amounts of tonnage over long distances, and in the process they consume
  significant quantities of diesel fuel. In 2012, the seven Class 1 railroads consumed more than 3.6 billion gallons (gal) of diesel
  fuel [<a class="endnotes">3</a>], amounting to 10 million gal/day and representing 7% of all diesel fuel consumed in the United States. The two largest
  consumers of diesel fuel among the Class 1 railroads&#8212;Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and Union Pacific&#8212;consumed more
  than 1 billion gal each in 2012. The cost to Class 1 railroads of consuming such large quantities of diesel fuel was more than $11
  billion in 2012, representing 23% of their total operating expense (Table IF3-1).</p>

<p>  Class 1 railroads are considering the use of LNG to fuel locomotives because of the potential for significant cost savings. Following
  years of tight price linkage, spot prices for crude oil (North Sea Brent) and natural gas (Henry Hub) diverged around 2005. In
  2012, the Brent spot price was about seven times the Henry Hub spot price on an energy equivalent basis. That differential is
  projected to narrow in the midterm, but a persistent gap is expected to continue, with crude oil prices more than three times
  higher than natural gas per million British thermal units (MMBtu) throughout the Reference case projection period, going out to
  2040 (Figure IF3-1).</p>
<img src="images/fig_if3-1.png" /><br />
<a href="excel/figif3-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a>
<p>The large differential between crude oil and natural gas  commodity prices translates directly into a significant
  disparity between projected LNG and diesel fuel prices, even
  after accounting for natural gas liquefaction costs that exceed
  refining costs. In the AEO2014 Reference case, the long-run
  price difference between locomotive diesel fuel and LNG in
  rail applications increases from $1.48/gal of diesel equivalent
  in 2014 to $1.77 in 2040 (Figure IF3-2).</p>
  <img src="images/fig_if3-2.png" /><br />
<a href="excel/figif3-2_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a>
<p>  Given the difference between LNG and diesel fuel prices in
  the Reference case, railroads that switch locomotive fuels
  could accrue significant fuel cost savings. Locomotives are
  used intensively, consume large amounts of fuel, and are
  kept in service for relatively long periods of time. The net
  present value of future fuel savings across the Reference
  case projection for an LNG locomotive compared to a diesel
  counterpart is well above the roughly $1 million higher cost of
  the LNG locomotive and tender (Figure IF3-3).</p>

<img src="images/fig_if3-3.png" /><br />
<a href="excel/figif3-3_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a>
<p>  Relatively large changes in assumptions used to evaluate
  investments in LNG locomotives (such as a significantly
  shorter payback period or much higher discount rate) or in fuel prices would be required to change LNG fuel economics for railroad use from favorable to unfavorable. Starting from the
  Reference case, the economics for switching to LNG locomotives remain favorable unless the payback period is reduced by eight
  years or the discount rate applied is raised by nine percentage points (Figure IF3-4). However, in the Low Oil Price case, the net
  present value of fuel cost savings associated with LNG use are not large enough to offset the higher additional upfront cost of LNG
  locomotives and tenders (Figure IF3-5). The shortfall in the value of fuel savings relative to upfront investment increases over the
  projection period in this case, making investments in LNG fueling less attractive over time. Clearly, uncertainty about future fuel
  prices suggests that there is some risk for companies in making such a fundamental change in freight rail operations.</p>

<h2>Challenges for liquefied natural gas as a freight rail fuel</h2>
<p>
While simple economic calculations involving the comparison of fuel cost savings to additional upfront cost are relatively
straightforward, other factors, including operational, financial, regulatory, and mechanical challenges, also affect fuel choices
by railroads. One of the most challenging factors raised by the switch to LNG locomotives by Class 1 railroads is the effect on
operations. Switching from diesel fuel to LNG would require a new delivery infrastructure for locomotive fuel. Natural gas would
need to be delivered to fuel depots, either by truck in smaller quantities, as LNG [<a class="endnotes">4</a>],or perhaps by pipeline. Larger quantities of natural gas would require liquefaction before delivery to tender cars for use in locomotives. Building the new infrastructure would
require a large financial investment in addition to the large investments made in locomotives and tender cars.</p>
<p>The building of LNG refueling infrastructure could also complicate the inter-operability of the rail network, depending on how
  quickly modifications could be made to accommodate refueling at multiple points around the nation. Impeding the ability of the
  rail network system to move goods because of a lack of fuel availability could drive up costs and lead to reductions in network
  flexibility and operational efficiency [<a class="endnotes">5</a>]. In addition, operations could be further affected by fuel switching because of the cost
  of training staff at refueling depots and in maintenance shops, updating maintenance facilities to handle LNG locomotives and
  tenders, and managing more extensive logistics [<a class="endnotes">6</a>]. Further, LNG locomotives and tender cars could require more maintenance
  than their diesel counterparts. All of these operational changes would create a duplicative infrastructure [<a class="endnotes">7</a>], because many
  diesel-fueled locomotives still would be in service at least for some significant period, and compression-ignited LNG locomotives
  still require at least some diesel fuel for combustion ignition.</p>
<p>  Replacing the current stock of diesel locomotives with LNG locomotives and tender cars would represent a significant financial
  investment by Class 1 railroads. In 2012, there were 25,174 locomotives in the service of Class 1 railroads, the vast majority of
  which were line-haul locomotives [<a class="endnotes">8</a>]. A new diesel line-haul locomotive costs about $2 million [<a class="endnotes">9</a>], and rebuilt locomotives cost
  about half that amount. With a new LNG locomotive and tender costing about $1 million more than a diesel counterpart, the cost
  to replace the entire diesel locomotive stock with LNG locomotives and tenders would be tens of billions of dollars, not including
  additional infrastructure, training, logistics, and a potential increase in maintenance costs. Moreover, much of the cost of the
  transition, such as purchases of locomotives and tender cars, potentially would occur over a much shorter time period than a fuel
  payback period.</p>
<p>  The financing requirement of large capital expenditures complicates the rather straightforward calculation of locomotive fuel
  economics. The amount of capital available to Class 1 railroads, either on hand or raised in capital markets, is an important factor
  in determining whether, or to what extent, railroads can take advantage of fuel cost savings over time. The decision to switch
  from diesel fuel to LNG is also influenced by the facts that railroads are a highly capital-intensive industry [<a class="endnotes">10</a>] with complete
  responsibility for maintaining the physical rail network, that they face many competing needs for financial investment, and that
  they must ensure adequate return on investment for their shareholders.</p>
<p>  On the regulatory side, LNG rail cargos currently are not permitted without a waiver from the Federal Railroad Administration
  (FRA) under Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rules. The development of standard LNG tenders and regulations
  is underway, with issues related to safety, crashworthiness, and environmental impact, including methane leakage, under
  consideration [<a class="endnotes">11</a>].</p>
<p>  Finally, LNG locomotives currently are undergoing extensive testing and demonstration to determine their fuel consumption,
  emissions, operational performance, and range under real-world conditions. Locomotives and tenders will be evaluated to ensure
  mechanical performance of such components as connections between tender and locomotive. Several Class 1 railroads are
  planning to start LNG locomotive demonstration projects to provide better understanding of the obstacles to an LNG fuel switch.</p>
<h2>The future of liquefied natural gas in freight rail: lessons from history</h2>
<p>The large potential fuel cost savings from the switch to LNG locomotives from diesel has resulted in great interest on the part
  of the freight rail industry, observers, and analysts. The companies have discussed the potential of LNG as comparable with the
  switch from steam propulsion to diesel in the 1940s and 50s [<a class="endnotes">12</a>], a revolution in freight rail known simply as &quot;dieselization.&quot; Other
  industry experts have responded with more caution, likening the switch to the more evolutionary transformation of diesel-electric
  freight rail locomotives from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) propulsion that has been occurring since the early 1990s [<a class="endnotes">13</a>].</p>
<p>  The diesel revolution in rail began in yard-switching operations during the mid-1920s, followed by passenger rail in the mid-1930s.
  After an initial period of hesitation, mainly because of the vast amount of capital already invested in steam locomotives and their
  refueling and watering infrastructure, diesel freight locomotives first appeared in 1941. They then captured the market at an
  extraordinary rate, with the last steam locomotive mustered out of service in 1961 [<a class="endnotes">14</a>].</p>
<p>  The advantages of using diesel locomotives over steam were numerous. While diesel locomotive costs were about double per
  horsepower compared to steam, diesel locomotives proved superior in almost every other way. Steam locomotives had to slow or
  stop to take on water, requiring extensive watering infrastructure, and they needed nearly constant cleaning, maintenance, and
  repair, with annual costs reaching 25% of the initial cost of the locomotive. The switch to diesel allowed the railroads to avoid
  costly watering time and infrastructure and dramatically reduced maintenance and repair. As a result, diesel engines could travel
  faster and thus double the annual mileage of steam locomotives. Diesel engines, unlike steam engines, could be turned on and off
  with relative ease; a lead diesel locomotive could control other locomotives on a unit train; the costs of rail line maintenance were
  reduced because diesel locomotives were lighter and did not “pound the tracks”; and maintenance costs were lowered by the use
  of standardized parts and design [<a class="endnotes">15</a>].</p>
<p>  Although diesel freight locomotives took over the market in 20 years, freight locomotives with AC traction motors, which began
  service in Class 1 railroads in the early 1990s, represent about 17% of the locomotive stock today [<a class="endnotes">16</a>]. AC locomotives have the major advantage of greater adhesion levels than their counterparts equipped with DC motors, allowing fewer locomotives
to pull the same load. The ability to reduce the number of locomotives pulling a unit train represents a significant improvement
in fuel efficiency, but it has not been adopted to the same extent as dieselization. Class 1 railroads have gradually adopted or
decided against AC traction for a variety of reasons related to operations, upfront incremental costs, and the ability to take
advantage of increased adhesion levels. For example, in recent years Union Pacific, Canadian Pacific, and CSX have chosen AC
traction locomotives because of locomotive unit reductions, reliability, interoperability, and life-cycle costs. Canadian National
Grand Trunk and Norfolk Southern have stayed with DC traction because of incremental cost and the inability to apply unit train
reductions. BNSF has chosen AC locomotives for coal runs, where they can take advantage of unit locomotive reductions, and DC
locomotives for intermodal runs, where they cannot [<a class="endnotes">17</a>].</p>
<p>These historical examples of the impacts of new technologies and fuels may offer insights into the future potential for LNG
  locomotives. As happened during the diesel revolution, freight railroads may adopt a completely new locomotive fuel and
  infrastructure over two decades if there is a compelling business case. However, many cost and operational efficiencies made
  diesel locomotives superior to steam locomotives, and the same dynamic may not be seen with LNG. Moreover, investment in
  existing capital stock and relevant equipment may be an impediment early in a transformation process.  </p>
<p>The ongoing evolution of AC traction locomotives shows that Class 1 railroads will invest in a new locomotive technology, at least
  gradually, if there is significant reason to do so. The decision may balance factors such as cost with operational efficacy.</p>
<h2>Liquefied natural gas in freight rail&#8212;revolution and evolution cases</h2>
<p>AEO2014 includes two alternative cases that examine the potential impact of LNG in freight rail, based on the diesel revolution and
  AC traction evolution. The cases also look at the impact of a specific LNG engine technology. The High Rail LNG case represents
  a revolution in freight rail locomotive fueling similar to that of dieselization in the 1940s and 1950s. After an initial trial period
  starting in 2017 through 2020, Class 1 railroads take advantage of the favorable economics of LNG locomotive fuel such that
  after a 20-year period, all freight rail motive stock is converted to LNG capability. The new locomotives are assumed to use highpressure
  direct injection (HPDI) LNG engine technology, which uses natural gas as the primary fuel and relies on a small amount
  of diesel fuel for ignition. HPDI engines use fuel at a ratio of about 95% LNG to 5% diesel. LNG-only engines are not expected to
  be adopted for locomotives.</p>
<p>  The Low Rail LNG case represents an evolution in freight rail locomotive fueling similar to the ongoing penetration of AC traction
  locomotives. After an initial trial period from 2017 through 2020, Class 1 railroads take advantage of the favorable LNG locomotive
  fuel economics by turning over their engine stocks at an average rate of 1% per year. The new LNG locomotives are assumed to
  use a dynamic gas blending engine, which uses diesel fuel for combustion until intake temperature rises, at which point natural
  gas is used. The engines are LNG-capable up to a fuel consumption ratio of 80% LNG and 20% diesel and have the added<br />
  advantage of being dual-fuel compatible, with the ability to switch back to 100% diesel fuel as needed. The Reference case does
  not make any assumption about the type of LNG engine used but instead allows LNG to penetrate into freight rail at the average
  annual turnover rate of new and rebuilt stock experienced over the last decade.</p>
<p>  The High and Low Rail LNG cases show a dramatic change in the fuel mix used by freight rail. In the Reference case, LNG fuel use
  increases from 0.5 trillion Btu in 2017 to 148 trillion Btu in 2040, or 35% of total freight rail energy consumption (Figure IF3-6).
  In the High Rail LNG case, LNG fuel consumption increases to 392 trillion Btu in 2040, or 95% of freight rail energy consumption.
  LNG consumption in the Low Rail LNG case increases to just
  64 trillion Btu, or 16% of total freight energy consumption.</p>
<img src="images/fig_if3-6.png" /><br />
<a href="excel/figif3-6_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a>
<p>While the impacts are dramatic in the freight rail sector, it is
  important to note that the impacts on total energy use in the
  U.S. transportation system and on the nation's total energy
  consumption are relatively small. In the Reference case,
  transportation diesel consumption increases from about
  6 quadrillion Btu in 2012 to 6.5 quadrillion Btu in 2017 and
  7.5 quadrillion Btu in 2040, with railroad diesel use of 0.5
  quadrillion Btu in 2012 decreasing to 0.4 quadrillion Btu in
  2017 and 0.3 quadrillion Btu in 2040, when LNG accounts for
  35% of projected energy use by freight rail in the Reference
  case. Most transportation diesel fuel consumption&#8212;more<br />
  than 80%&#8212;occurs in heavy-duty vehicles. Because freight
  rail accounts for only a small share of transportation diesel
  use, projected total transportation diesel fuel use in 2040
  varies only modestly across cases with different levels of LNG
  use in freight rail, ranging from 7.3 quadrillion Btu in the High
  Rail LNG case to 7.6 quadrillion Btu in the Low Rail LNG case.</p>
<p>Projected natural gas consumption for transportation (excluding pipeline transportation) is sensitive to variation in freight rail use
  of LNG, because relatively small amounts of natural gas currently are consumed in mobile applications either as compressed or
  liquefied natural gas. Natural gas consumption in the transportation sector (including pipeline transportation) increases from 0.9
  quadrillion Btu in 2040 in the Reference case to 1.1 quadrillion Btu in the High Rail LNG case and to 0.8 quadrillion Btu in the Low
  Rail LNG case. The projected changes in use of LNG in rail have marginal impacts on retail natural gas prices in the transportation<br />
  sector, which impact natural gas demand in other transportation uses. As a result of these price changes, heavy-duty truck
  natural gas demand partially offsets the consumption impacts occurring in rail.</p>
<p>  Because the transportation sector is a relatively small consumer of natural gas compared to other sectors, the seemingly dramatic
  fuel switch from the perspective of freight rail is only a minor change in overall U.S. natural gas consumption. Total U.S. natural gas
  energy consumption varies from 32.3 quadrillion Btu in 2040 in the Reference case to 32.4 quadrillion Btu in the High Rail LNG
  case and 32.1 quadrillion Btu in the Low Rail LNG case.</p>

        <p>1.Consider impact of free piston linear generators operating at compression ratios of 40 or more burning very lean fuel mixtures with thermal efficiencies of up to 80% such as researched by Sandia labs and the DOT. Such engines can switch fuels and change compression ratios on the fly have lower maintenance, fewer moving parts and longer life projections. 2. The carbon footprint of LNG is significantly lower than diesel and the lowest of carbon based fuels. 3. Such engines can also operate on anhydrous ammonia for no carbon footprint if it is made from water using renewable solar or wind power. Good article, Thanks John</p>

        <p>Great article. Some more coverage on storage costs would be useful with consideration of carbon costs accentuating the difference between diesel and LNG.</p>

        <p><em>04/14/2014 - Texas, United States</em><br /></p>
        <p>The main failing of this assessment, which actually nullifies the conclusions, is the projected price disparity between liquid fuels and LNG, the result of the current crude price bubble. A more realistic assumption is the return of the price relationship to historical levels going forward.</p>
