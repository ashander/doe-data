<h3><strong>Changes in release cycles for EIA's International  Energy Outlook <br />
and Annual Energy Outlook</strong></h3>
<p style="max-width:550px">To focus more  resources on rapidly changing energy markets and how they might evolve over the  next few years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration is revising the  schedule and approach for production of the <em>International  Energy Outlook</em> (<em>IEO</em>) and the <em>Annual Energy Outlook</em> (<em>AEO</em>). Starting with <em>IEO2013</em>, which was released in July  2013, EIA adopted a two-year release cycle for both the <em>IEO</em> and <em>AEO</em>. Under  this approach, a full edition of the <em>IEO</em> and <em>AEO</em> will be produced in  alternating years, and an interim, shorter edition of each will be produced in the  off years.</p>
