<P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">An unexpected surge in economic growth and productivity in the United States since 1995 has
stimulated much discussion about a "new economy." This paper examines the effect of information and
communication technology (IT) on economic growth and productivity. Contrary to views that have
appeared in the press and elsewhere, we emphasize that the effect of IT on recent U.S. labor
productivity growth is more like a continuation of past trends than any great departure, and that it is not
unique to the U.S. An equally unexpected acceleration in multifactor productivity (MFP) is also a major
contributor to the acceleration in U.S. labor productivity growth. Although available industry-level data
cloud the behavior of IT users' MFP, we see no strong evidence that IT is the generator of U.S. MFP
growth among users of IT. Finally, we contend that what is really different about the U.S. economy in the
late 1990's is the behavior of its labor market, a factor that has been given too little consideration in the
"new economy" explanation of the late '90's U.S. economic success story.</font></P>
