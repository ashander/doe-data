<P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">Productivity is now growing considerably faster than it did over the 20 years after 1973.  What
can be said about the sources of this acceleration?  Two simple analyzes help to answer this
question.  The first estimates the contributions to growth in aggregate private nonfarm business
productivity from each of the different sources of that growth, such as increases in the amount of
capital per worker.  The second uses data on output and employment by industry to pinpoint the
areas of economic activity where the acceleration has taken place.</font></P>
