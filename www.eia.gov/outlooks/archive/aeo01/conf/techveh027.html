      <p align="left">We have already delivered more than 60,000 Prius vehicles
      globally. Although this number is small compared to Camry, it exceeds the
      total sales of all other &quot;eco&quot; vehicles.</p>
      <p align="left">Automobile manufacturers alone will not decide which
      technologies eventually win out toward the ultimate eco-car in the
      marketplace. That decision will be made by society. We believe that hybrid
      vehicles represent a practical way of lowering the environmental impact of
      the automobile while still offering the customer the attributes he or she
      has come to expect. We believe they are the logical transition to the
      future. I’d be glad to answer your questions at this time.</p>
