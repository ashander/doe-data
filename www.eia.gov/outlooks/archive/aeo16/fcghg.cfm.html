      <h1>Fuel Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Phase 2 Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles</h1>
      <p class="author">david stone, melissa lynes</p>
      <p class="release">Release Date: 6/22/16</p>
<img src="images/fuelconsump.jpg" />
<p>The  transportation sector is the second-largest consumer of energy in the United  States, accounting for more than 70% of U.S. petroleum consumption and thus  playing a significant role in projections of energy demand. The <em>Annual  Energy Outlook</em><em> 2016</em> (AEO2016) Reference  case reflects the effects of existing laws and regulations on the fuel  consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles,  which in 2015 accounted for 20% of total energy consumption in the  transportation sector and 60% of total delivered distillate fuel consumption.</p>
<p>EIA  has produced a separate case—the Phase 2 Standards case—to analyze the impacts  of a proposed rulemaking jointly issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in  July 2015 [<a class="endnotes">1</a>] The proposed standards build on the Phase 1 GHG emissions  standards for medium-duty vehicles (MDVs) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) that were  implemented starting in model year (MY) 2014. The proposed Phase 2 rulemaking establishes  a second round of standards for GHG emissions and fuel consumption by medium-  and heavy-duty trucks. The Phase 1 standards extend through MY 2018. The  proposed Phase 2 standards take effect in MY 2021 (or MY 2018 for trailers) and  increase in stringency through MY 2027.</p>
<p>In the AEO2016 Phase 2 Standards case, average  fuel economy increases for all new vehicles covered by the standards. In 2040,  total MDV and HDV energy consumption, which is 3.4 million barrels per day oil  equivalent in the AEO2016 Reference case, is 2.6 million barrels per day oil  equivalent in the Phase 2 Standards case, or 22% lower. Total MDV and HDV  diesel fuel use in 2040 is 18% lower than in the Reference case. With higher on-road  fuel economy of the truck stock in the Phase 2 Standards case, total delivered  energy consumption in the transportation sector is 6% lower in 2040 than in the  Reference case. As the average fuel economy of conventional vehicles increases  in the Phase 2 Standards case, there is also less  incentive to pay high capital  costs for natural gas and propane vehicles despite their lower fuel costs, and  there is a shift away from natural gas and propane toward conventional diesel  and gasoline fuels.</p>
<p>The  proposed Phase 2 standards address specific vehicle categories, including  combination tractors, trailers, heavy-duty (HD) pickup trucks and vans, and  vocational vehicles (Table IF2-1). For combination tractors, standards are  proposed by cab, roof, and fuel type. In addition, for the first time,  standards are proposed for heavy-haul tractors [<a class="endnotes">2</a>] and for trailers pulled by Class 7 and Class 8 tractors. The  proposed standards for trailers vary in stringency, depending on the type of  trailer. For HD pickups and vans,  the proposed standards are categorized by diesel or gasoline engine and are set  as total gallons consumed per 100 miles or as grams per mile. For heavy-duty  pickups and vans, the proposed standards consider a vehicle&rsquo;s <em>work factor</em>—the weighted average of  payload and towing capacity. For vocational vehicles, the proposed standards  are based on chassis type, gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), engine type, and  drive cycle.</p>
<p>The AEO2016 Phase 2 Standards case analyzes the  estimated effects of the proposed regulations on fuel consumption and GHG  emissions. The requirements for each of the vehicle categories are derived from  U.S. Energy Information Administration  projected sales, distributed into the size classes according to data from Polk Automotive [<a class="endnotes">3</a>] and the  U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (VIUS) [<a class="endnotes">4</a>].</p>

<h4>Heavy-duty pickups and vans</h4>
<p>The proposed standards for heavy-duty pickups and vans in  Class 2b (GVWR between 8,501 and 10,000 pounds) and Class 3 (GVWR between  10,001 and 14,000 pounds) are phased in from MY 2021 to MY 2027. Although heavy-duty  pickups and vans often use efficiency improvements similar to those for  light-duty pickup trucks and vans, the standards are based on a work-based  metric rather than on the footprint metric used for light-duty vehicles. The  work factor incorporates towing and payload capacity as well as four-wheel  drive capability in determining minimum fuel efficiency requirements.</p>
<p>The proposed standards include an annual 2.5%/year  reduction in allowable emissions from MY 2021 to MY 2027, an approximate 16%  increase from the standards set by Phase 1 for MY 2018. Standards are set  individually for vehicles with spark ignition engines and vehicles with compression  ignition engines, but the standards are expected to improve at the same rate.  Compliance test procedures for heavy-duty pickups and vans employ the same EPA  drive cycles used to determine light-duty vehicle compliance, and manufacturer  compliance retains the same Phase 1 production-weighted fleet average to  determine compliance. </p>
<h4>Combination tractor cabs</h4>
<p>The proposed Phase 2 standards continue the  attribute-based classification of combination tractor cabs from Phase 1&#8212;by  Classes 7 and 8, day and sleeper cabs, and roof height (low, mid, high). In  addition, a specific set of vocational tractors, <em>heavy-haul tractors</em>, are subject to a specific standard to reflect  their unique powertrains. The proposed standards would require reductions in  carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption of up to 24% compared to  the MY 2017 baseline [<a class="endnotes">5</a>]
They  are based on expected technology improvements for engines, transmissions,  drivelines, aerodynamics,  tires, accessories, and extended idle reduction technologies. Tractors are  certified with the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Model (GEM)
[<a class="endnotes">6</a>].
<h4>Trailers</h4>
<p>The contributions of trailers to fuel efficiency  improvement are not regulated in Phase 1. The proposed Phase 2 standards apply  to trailers pulled by Classes 7 and 8 tractors coupled to the fifth wheel. The  most comprehensive requirements are applicable to traditional long-box  trailers, both refrigerated and dry, which typically are pulled by high-roof  cab tractors. The proposed changes center on improving aerodynamics and reducing  rolling resistance. Compliance is determined with a version of GEM. The standards  are less stringent for trailer categories with shorter boxes or trailers with  aerodynamic limitations. Non-box trailers and non-aerodynamic box vans are  required to adopt specific tire technologies to comply. In total, there are 10  separate categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Long-box  dry vans (longer than 50 feet)</li>
  <li>Long-box  refrigerated vans (longer than 50 feet)</li>
  <li>Short-box  dry vans (50 feet and shorter)</li>
  <li>Short-box  refrigerated vans (50 feet and shorter)</li>
  <li>Partial-aero  long-box dry vans</li>
  <li>Partial-aero  long-box refrigerated vans</li>
  <li>Partial-aero  short-box dry vans</li>
  <li>Partial-aero  short-box refrigerated vans</li>
  <li>Non-aero  box vans (all lengths of dry and refrigerated vans)</li>
  <li>Non-box  trailers (tanker, platform, container chassis, and all other types of highway  trailers that are not box trailers).</li>
</ul>
<p>With  the exception of refrigerated units, trailers typically do not directly emit  GHGs. However, the proposed standards assign required levels of emissions and  fuel consumption as if the trailers were pulled by a standard reference tractor [<a class="endnotes">7</a>]. The  standards require reductions of 3% to 8% from MY 2021 to MY 2027 in fuel  consumption and CO2 emissions, depending on the trailer type. Certain trailers  are exempt, including those that operate only at low speed and those that are used  for logging and mining. Trailers are also certified with GEM.</p>
<h4> Vocational vehicles</h4>
<p>Vocational  vehicles are separated into three class groups: light heavy-duty (Classes 2b–5),  medium heavy-duty (Classes 6–7), and heavy heavy-duty (Class 8). Each class  group is separated by engine type (compression or spark ignition) and a duty  cycle that captures expected vehicle usage and energy consumption. The three  available duty cycles are urban, multi-purpose, and regional. Because power  requirements for vocational vehicles vary widely, multiple baseline drivelines are  available in the Phase 2 standards for calculating fuel efficiency and GHG  emission improvements. Standards are set at increments starting in MY 2021,  with updates in MY 2024 and MY 2027.</p>
<p>In comparison with MY 2017 baseline vehicles, the proposed standards  require a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption for all vehicles  across all weight classes powered by compression ignition (primarily diesel)  engines. Vocational vehicles powered by spark ignition engines are subject to  emission and fuel-use reductions by MY 2027 of 12% for light heavy-duty, 13%  for medium heavy-duty, and 12% for heavy heavy-duty. Like combination tractors  and trailers, vocational vehicles are certified with GEM.</p>
<h4>Certification for combination tractors, trailers, and vocational vehicles</h4>
<p>As in Phase 1, compliance for tractors and vocational  vehicles is certified in Phase 2 using an updated version of GEM that incorporates some fixed input values, such as payload  and trailer weights, to determine fuel efficiency performance by drive cycle.  Compliance can be achieved through adoption of various technology combinations.  Improving on Phase 1, the Phase 2 GEM incorporates several changes to more  accurately reflect the effects of technology adoption on fuel efficiency  performance. These changes include road grade, an additional averaged  aerodynamic drag coefficient, and improved simulation of engines and  transmissions. Ultimately, the changes mean that a vehicle evaluated with the Phase  2 GEM would have higher CO2 emissions and fuel consumption than if evaluated  with the Phase 1 GEM. Consequently, results from the two standards are not  directly comparable. Trailers are modeled in GEM  with attribute inputs for aerodynamics, tires, weight characteristics, and  performance.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>The Phase 2 Standards case estimates fuel efficiency improvement  and fuel consumption based on the proposed requirements for combination  tractors, HD pickups and vans, and vocational vehicles. Trailer stocks are not  explicitly modeled, because there are limited data on trailer inventories and  usage; however, efficiency improvements as a result of the adoption of limited  trailer improvements are included in the model. Between MY 2017 and MY 2027, the  Phase 2 Standards case indicates that the proposed standards lead to the  adoption of technologies to improve fuel economy that otherwise would not have  been purchased. Although the standards do not start until MY 2021,  manufacturers are expected to begin adoption beforehand to ensure initial  compliance by MY 2021. Fuel economy and energy usage reports combine vocational  and nonvocational vehicles for Classes 3, 4–6, and 7–8.</p>
<p>  New vehicle average fuel economy increases for all size  classes in the Phase 2 Standards case. From 2017 to 2027, new vehicle average  fuel economy (combined Classes 3–8) rises by 28% in the Phase 2 Standards case  compared to the Reference case. After 2027 the standards are held constant, but  technology adoption continues as new technologies become available. In 2040, new  vehicle fuel efficiency averages 10.6 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent in  the Phase 2 Standards case, representing a 33% improvement compared to the Reference  case. The improvements represent overcompliance as the model continues to adopt  cost-effective technologies beyond 2027.</p>
<p>The increase in fuel economy of the entire vehicle stock  is lagged, reflecting slow turnover in the stock of Classes 2b–8 trucks, which  have a median lifetime of 12 years [<a class="endnotes">8</a>]. As new  medium- and heavy-duty trucks are added to the total stock, and older trucks  with lower fuel economy are removed from service, the average on-road fuel  economy for the total stock of heavy-duty trucks increases in the Phase  2 Standards case (Figure  IF2-1).</p>
<p><img src="images/fig_if2-1.png" /><br />
  <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figif2-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a></p>
<p>In comparison  with the AEO2016 Reference case, differences in total vehicle sales and stocks  are negligible in the Phase 2 Standards case. Between 2017 and 2040, new MDV  and HDV sales per year are equal to about 5% of the total truck stock, ranging from  about 660,000 to 790,000 new MDV and HDV sales per year out of a total stock  that grows from 11.7 million in 2017 to 17.2 million in 2040. However, there is  a shift away from natural gas and propane toward conventional diesel and  gasoline in the Phase 2 Standards case. As the average fuel economy of conventional vehicles increases, there is  less incentive to pay high capital costs for natural gas and propane vehicles, despite  their lower fuel costs.</p>
<p>The most significant effect of Phase 2 is a  reduction of diesel consumption—the most commonly used fuel&#8212;in medium- and heavy-duty  vehicles. In the Reference case, MDV and HDV diesel consumption increases  steadily through 2040, as industrial output grows (Figure IF2-2). In the Phase  2 Standards case, diesel consumption decreases from 2015 to 2033 as gains in  fuel economy more than offset growth in transport requirements. After 2033,  diesel consumption increases slowly without continued enhancement of the  standard, but in 2040 it still is 18% lower in the Phase 2 Standards case than  in the Reference case. Cumulative MDV and HDV consumption of diesel fuel from  2021 to 2040 in the Phase 2 Standards case is 2.5 billion barrels lower than in  the Reference case. </p>
<p><img src="images/fig_if2-2.png" /><br />
  <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figif2-2_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a></p>
<p>The reduction in  diesel consumption in the Phase 2 Standards case has significant implications  for the mix, as well as the amount, of petroleum products consumed in the  United States. Implications for refiners would depend on the extent to which  similar standards were adopted in other countries with significant trucking  activity, because diesel and other petroleum products are widely traded in  global markets.</p>
<p>Consumption of other fuels by MDVs and HDVs&#8212;including  gasoline, propane, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and compressed natural gas  (CNG)—is lower in the Phase 2 Standards case than in the Reference case (Figure  IF2-3). In the Phase 2 Standards case, diesel fuel consumption accounts for 90%  of all fuel consumption by MDVs and HDVs in 2040, with the remainder consisting  primarily of gasoline and a small amount of natural gas. The higher diesel  share in the Phase 2 Standards case reflects a shift away from alternative  fuels as improved fuel economy reduces the incentive to pay high capital costs  for natural gas and propane vehicles despite their lower fuel costs.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig_if2-3.png" /><br />
  <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figif2-3_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data </a></p>
<p>In the  Phase 2 Standards case, higher on-road fuel economy of the truck stock reduces  total delivered energy consumption in the transportation sector. From 2021 to  2040, cumulative delivered energy consumption in the transportation sector is 3%  lower in the Phase 2 Standards case than in the Reference case, and total transportation  sector energy consumption in 2040 is about 750,000 barrels per day oil  equivalent (22%) lower than in the Reference case (Figure IF2-4). Cumulative CO2  emissions from 2021 to 2040 in the transportation sector are 1,200 million  metric tons (3%) lower in the Phase  2 Standards case than  in the AEO2016 Reference case. In 2040, total transportation sector CO2 emissions  are 6% lower in the Phase 2 Standards case than in the AEO2016 Reference case  (Figure IF2-5).</p>

<h4>Regulatory  and data issues</h4>  
<ul>
  <li>Although  Class 2b pickup trucks and vans are included in the Phase 2 Standards case,  their fuel economy and consumption are not reported individually. However, the  effects of Class 2b are included in total transportation fuel consumption and  emissions data.</li>
<li>The  Phase 2 Standards case  approximates the proposed rulemaking by disaggregating  Class 7 and Class 8 tractor vehicle body types (based on data from the VIUS  survey [<a class="endnotes">9</a>], which  has not been updated since 2002). As a result, there may be significant  differences between the tractor market today and more than a decade ago.  Further, there are data uncertainties associated with vehicle usage reported in  the VIUS survey. Nevertheless, the data were used because VIUS is the only  source of information on tractor type.</li>
<li>Trailers  were not explicitly modeled in this study, because there are limited data on  trailer inventories and usage. There are more registered trailers than  tractors, and an understanding of usage logistics is critical to evaluating the  adoption and overall results of improving trailer technology.</li>
 <li>Despite  improvements since the start of Phase 1, there are still limits on data about the  technologies used to meet the Phase 1 compliance standards. Consequently, it is  difficult to estimate the energy outcomes that could be expected as medium- and  heavy-duty trucks begin to comply with the new Phase 2 standards. Without  better data, it is difficult to analyze the composition of the truck market at  the level of diversity included in the proposed standards, or the efficiency  and fuel economy metrics associated with each classification in the standards.</li>
<li>A  critical issue is the limited availability of information that would provide a  baseline from which to measure improvement. The lack of baseline data is a  result of the previously discussed data limitations, as well as operational changes  in Phase 2 compared with Phase 1. Although many improvements have been made in  GEM, the changes evaluation methods for the different technology categories  make it difficult to map Phase 1 compliance to Phase 2. The baseline for Phase  2 (MY 2017) assumes compliance with Phase 1 at that time, and it is evaluated  differently. As a result, it is not known whether Phase 1 compliant vehicles in  MY 2017 accurately represent the proposed Phase 2 baseline.</li>
<li>Continuing  issues from Phase 1 include how compliance will be measured and how well  compliance testing procedures will replicate the average real-world performance  of combination tractors, heavy-duty pickups and vans, vocational vehicles, and trailers.  Phase 2 has three vocational drive cycles that can be used for compliance  (urban, multi-purpose, and regional). Only the multi-purpose cycle is used in  the AEO2016 Phase 2 Standards case. GEM has many new categories and  improvements compared with Phase 1, but many of the categories are simplified  to <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> responses, rather than to custom inputs. Some inputs, including  payload and trailer weights, are fixed.</li>
<li>Compliance  for heavy-duty pickups and vans will be determined by a vehicle test procedure  similar to that used in the national program for light-duty vehicles, including  the highway fuel economy test and the federal test procedure for city driving,  weighted 45% and 55%, respectively. Heavy-duty pickups and vans are assumed to  be loaded to one-half of their payload capacity.</li></ul>
