      <h1>Market Trends: Electricity demand</h1>
      

<h2><a name="growth_elec"></a>Growth in electricity use from 2015 to 2040
  slows to 24% with Clean Power Plan (CPP) and
  to 27% with no CPP</h2>
   
   
   
   <p>Electricity demand growth (including retail sales and direct
     use) has slowed in every decade since the 1950s, from
     9.8%/year from 1949–59 to 0.5%/year from 2000–2015.
     In the AEO2016 Reference case and No CPP case, electricity
     demand growth remains relatively slow, as rising demand
     for electric services is offset by efficiency gains from new
     appliance standards and investments in energy-efficient
     equipment. Total electricity demand grows by 24% (0.9%/year) from 2015–40 in the Reference case, which includes the
     effects of the Clean Power Plan (CPP). In the No CPP case,   demand increases by 27% from 2015–40 (1.0%/year). U.S.
     electricity demand is affected primarily by population growth
     and economic activity. However, electricity demand growth
     has been significantly slower than gross domestic product
     (GDP) growth in recent years and continues to be slower in
     the projections (Figure MT-27).</p>
   <p><img src="images/fig_mt-27.png" /><br />
     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt27_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a>   </p>
   <p>Electricity sales grow at a slower rate than electricity use,
     given the increasing role of self-generation in all end-use
     sectors. Total retail electricity sales increase by 20% (0.7%/year) from 2015–40 in the Reference case and by 23%
     (0.8%/year) in the No CPP case. Population shifts to warmer
     regions increase cooling requirements, which affects both
     residential and commercial electricity sales. In the residential
     sector, electricity sales grow by 9% and 11% from 2015–40
     in the Reference case and No CPP case, respectively. The
     increasing energy efficiency of residential appliances and
     consumer electronics offsets some of the growth in electricity
     demand that would otherwise have occurred as a result of
     the increasing availability and sales of electronic devices.
     In the commercial sector, electricity demand grows by 21%
     in the Reference case and by 26% in the No CPP case from
     2015–40, as demand for electrical devices and equipment
     continues to rise. In the industrial sector, electricity demand
     grows by 30% in the Reference case and by 32% in No CPP
     case from 2015–40, initially as a result of increasing sales in
     the primary metals, bulk chemical, and food industries, and
     later as a result of growth in the construction and metal-based
     durables industries. However, while demand increases for
     most industrial uses, total electricity use per unit of output
     declines in both the Reference case and No CPP case as
     energy efficiency increases.</p>
   <h2><a name="electricity_coal"></a>Clean Power Plan accelerates shift from coal to
     natural gas and renewables</h2>
   <p>The Clean Power Plan (CPP) requires states to develop plans
     to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing fossilfired
     electric generating units. The AEO2016 Reference case assumes that states will choose to cooperate with each other
     at the regional level [<a class="endnotes">11</a>], using a mass-based (cap-and-trade)
     program that allocates allowances to load-serving entities to
     reduce the potential impacts of higher rates on consumers.</p>
   <p>If the CPP emerges intact from legal challenges, it is expected
     to reinforce the trend toward less carbon-intensive generation
     by accelerating the shift away from coal to natural gas and
     renewables, and toward increased energy efficiency. In the
     Reference case, coal use for electricity generation is overtaken
     by natural gas in 2024 and by renewables in 2028.</p>
   <p>     In the Reference case, higher electricity prices and the push
     for greater energy efficiency slows the 2015–30 growth rate of
     U.S. total electricity sales, from 1%/year from 2015–30 in the
     No CPP case to 0.8%/year in the Reference case. In addition,
     the higher cost associated with CO2 emissions under the CPP
     contributes to a 1.5% annual decline in electricity generated
     from coal, which drops from 1,355 billion kilowatthours
     (kWh) (a 33% share) in 2015 to 919 billion kWh (18%) in
     2040. Retirements of coal-fired generators by 2030, increase
     from 60 gigawatts (GW) in the No CPP case to 92 GW in the
     Reference case, or about one-third of current capacity (Figure
     MT-28). Growth in generation from renewable energy sources
     also accelerates from 3.2%/year in the No CPP case to 3.8%/year in the Reference case, as total renewable generation
     increases from 546 billion kWh (13% of current generation) to
     1,374 billion kWh (27% of 2040 generation in the Reference
     case). The average growth rate of nonhydropower renewable
     generation from 2015–40 increases from 4.5%/year in the No
     CPP case to 5.3%/year in the Reference case.</p>

   <h2><a name="cap_natgas"></a>With no Clean Power Plan (CPP), coal-fired
     generation shows little change from 2015 level</h2>
   <p>The decline in natural gas prices since 2009 has threatened
     the cost competitiveness of existing U.S. coal-fired generators,
     resulting in a 25% reduction in coal-fired generation in 2015
     from its level in the mid-2000s. In the No CPP case, natural gas-fired generation roughly equals coal generation in the United
     States on an annual basis in 2016. After declining somewhat
     from 2016-20 with strong renewable growth as a result of tax
     credits, the natural gas share increases steadily in the No CPP
     case, overtaking the coal share in 2029 as the predominant fuel
     for electricity generation. In 2040, the natural gas share of total
     generation is 34% in the No CPP case.</p>
   <p>Recent policy and technology developments, including
     the extension of production and investment tax credits for
     renewable generation technologies enacted in December 2015,
     as well as reduced capital costs for solar photovoltaic systems,
     are further increasing the pressure on coal. In the No CPP case,
     renewables generation increases at 3.2%/year from 546 billion
     kilowatthours (kWh) (a 13% share) in 2015 to 1,204 billion kWh
     (a 23% share) in 2040 (Figure MT-29). Nonhydro renewables
     generation grows at the fastest rate through 2040, increasing
     at 4.5%/year, from 252 billion kWh in 2015 to 750 billion kWh
     in 2040. Over the same period, hydroelectric generation grows
     at 0.7%/year, from 245 billion kWh in 2015 to 294 billion kWh
     in 2040.</p>
   <p><img src="images/fig_mt-29.png" /><br />
     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt29_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a> </p>
  <p>The coal share of total electricity generation falls from 48% in
    2008 to 31% in 2029, when the natural gas share surpasses it,
    and then continues to decline, falling to a 26% share in 2040.
    Coal generation is essentially flat from 2015 to 2040 in the
    No CPP case. A large portion of the decline in coal generation
    is attributable to the retirement of coal generating capacity
    in the No CPP case. The No CPP case has 60 gigawatts of
    cumulative coal capacity retirements between 2016 and 2030.
    Nuclear generating capacity remains virtually unchanged over
    the projection in the No CPP case, as additions are more than
    offset by retirements. Total nuclear generation is flat at about
    789 billion kWh, accounting for a 20% share in 2015 and a 15%
    share in 2040. Coal and nuclear generation, which together
    satisfied 70% of U.S. generation requirements as recently as
    2005, fall to a 47% share of total generation in 2030 and a 42%
    share in 2040 in the No CPP case.</p>
  <h2><a name="powerplant_cap"></a>Renewables and natural gas lead capacity
    additions through 2040 in the Reference case</h2>
  <p>In the AEO2016 Reference case, two developments significantly
    improve the prospects for renewable capacity: extension of
    favorable federal tax treatment for renewable generators,
    and continued dramatic reductions in the capital cost of solar
    photovoltaic (PV) systems. In the Reference case, cumulative
    additions to U.S. generating capacity from 2016–40 total 483
    gigawatts (GW) for all technologies, including 302 GW of
    renewable technology additions (63% of the total), both powersector
    and end-use generators (Figure MT-30). Renewable
    generation capacity additions consist primarily of wind (73
    GW) and solar (221 GW) technologies, including 77 GW of<br />
    solar PV installations in the end-use sectors.</p>
  <p><img src="images/fig_mt-30.png" /><br />
     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt30_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
  <p>The increase in renewable capacity additions helps offset
    the retirement of 100 GW of coal-fired capacity as a result of
    environmental legislation, including implementation of the
    Clean Power Plan. Relatively low natural gas prices from 2016–40 also lead to a significant increase in natural gas-fired capacity,
    with 175 GW of gas-fired capacity additions accounting for
    36% of the total increase. Total renewable capacity additions
    average 16 GW/year through 2024. From 2025–40, renewable
    capacity additions slow to 10 GW/year, as electricity demand
    growth slows. Virtually all capacity additions after 2025 in the
    Reference case are solar PV and natural gas, which account for
    53% and 43% of total additions, respectively, over the 2025–40
    period. Among fossil fuel generating technologies, natural gasfired
    combined-cycle plants remain the least-cost option for
    new capacity additions, and they generally are more efficient to
    operate than existing steam plants fueled with natural gas, oil,
    or coal.</p>
  <h2><a name="gen_cap"></a>In the No CPP case, most new electricity
    generation capacity uses natural gas
    and renewables</h2>
  <p>In the No CPP case, additions to electricity generation capacity—including those in the end-use sectors—total 392 gigawatts
    (GW) from 2016–40 (Figure MT-31). Capacity additions in the
    near term replace retiring coal-fired plants, which are the result
    of low natural gas prices and implementation of the Mercury
    Air Toxic Standards. Coal-fired capacity declines from 284 GW
    in 2015 to 215 GW in 2040, with much of that capacity retired
    by 2025. A total of 60 GW of coal-fired capacity is retired
    from 2016–25 in the No CPP case, including both announced
    retirements and those projected on the basis of market factors.
    Total capacity additions average 16 GW/year from 2016–40,
    with 97 GW of renewable capacity additions from 2016–25 and
    44 GW of natural gas additions over the same period.</p>
    <p><img src="images/fig_mt-31.png" /><br />
     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt31_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
  <p>Renewable additions in the No CPP case benefit from the
    extension of the federal tax credit in the near term and from
    declining costs in the long term. Renewable additions total 236
    GW from 2016–40, primarily solar (178 GW) and wind (52
    GW). The solar capacity additions include 74 GW of rooftop
    and other distributed solar generation installations in the enduse
    sectors. Most of the wind capacity is added before 2025 to
    take advantage of the production tax credit, which is available
    only to projects beginning substantive development before
    2020. Solar capacity is added steadily through 2040, as it
    becomes more cost-competitive as a result of declining capital
    cost and the investment tax credit. The tax credit phases down
    from 30% in 2016 to 10% in 2022 and then remains at that level
    for utility and commercially operated solar projects but ends
    for residential solar projects.</p>
  <p>In the No CPP case, natural gas accounts for 38% (150 GW)
    of cumulative capacity additions from 2016–40. The relatively
    steady growth of natural gas capacity, which helps to maintainbaseload generation and provide grid reliability services, also
    results from continued low natural gas prices.</p>
  <h2><a name="cost_cap"></a>Electricity prices rise and fall with natural gas
    availability and prices</h2>
  <p>In the No CPP case, additions to electricity generation capacity—including those in the end-use sectors—total 392 gigawatts

    results from continued low natural gas prices.</p>
  <h2><a name="nucelec"></a>Electricity generation mix responds
    significantly to natural gas prices</h2>
  <p>Recent low natural gas prices have led to a shift from coal to
    natural gas for electricity generation. In addition, favorable
    federal and state policies have supported increases in renewable
    capacity. The future generation mix will depend to significant
    extent on future natural gas prices, as existing natural gas plants
    compete with coal for dispatch decisions in the short term, and
    natural gas combined-cycle capacity competes with wind and
    solar capacity in the longer term. The AEO2016 Low and High<br />
    Oil and Gas Resource and Technology cases provide a range of
    potential future natural gas price paths that could affect the mix
    of fuels used for electricity generation. In the High Oil and Gas
    Resource and Technology case, delivered natural gas prices
    remain below $4/million British thermal units (Btu) through
    2040. In the Low Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case,
    delivered natural gas prices rise steadily, to $8/million Btu in
    2030 and more than $9/million Btu in 2040.</p>
  <p><img src="images/fig_mt-33.png" /><br />
     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt33_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
  <p>Lower natural gas prices in the High Resource and Technology
    case lead to a 48% natural gas share of total generation in
    2030—compared with 37% in the Reference case—and a 55%
    share in 2040 (Figure MT-33). An additional 39 gigawatts of
    coal-fired capacity is retired by 2040, and the coal share of
    total generation falls from 33% in 2015 to 17% in 2030 and to
    11% in 2040. Renewable capacity additions in the same case
    are less than half of those in the Reference case, and the overall
    renewable share of total generation is 18% in 2030 and 19%
    in 2040, compared with 24% and 27%, respectively, in the
    Reference case.</p>
  <p>In the Low Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case,
    higher natural gas prices reduce the natural gas share of total
    electricity generation from 33% in 2015 to 18% in 2030 and to
    16% in 2040. Fewer coal plants are retired, allowing for higher
    levels of coal-fired generation than in the Reference case. More
    new renewable generation reduces the share of more expensive
    natural gas-fired generation needed to meet the growth in
    demand for electricity.</p>
  <h2><a name="solar_photo"></a>Resource availability has more effect than the
    Clean Power Plan on natural gas-fired generation</h2>
  <p>In the No CPP case, additions to electricity generation capacity—including those in the end-use sectors—total 392 gigawatts
    (GW) from 2016–40 (Figure MT-31). Capacity additions in the
    near term replace retiring coal-fired plants, which are the result
    of low natural gas prices and implementation of the Mercury
    Air Toxic Standards. Coal-fired capacity declines from 284 GW
    in 2015 to 215 GW in 2040, with much of that capacity retired
    by 2025. A total of 60 GW of coal-fired capacity is retired
    from 2016–25 in the No CPP case, including both announced
    retirements and those projected on the basis of market factors.
    Total capacity additions average 16 GW/year from 2016–40,
    with 97 GW of renewable capacity additions from 2016–25 and
    44 GW of natural gas additions over the same period.</p>

  <p>Renewable additions in the No CPP case benefit from the
    extension of the federal tax credit in the near term and from
    declining costs in the long term. Renewable additions total 236
    GW from 2016–40, primarily solar (178 GW) and wind (52
    GW). The solar capacity additions include 74 GW of rooftop
    and other distributed solar generation installations in the enduse
    sectors. Most of the wind capacity is added before 2025 to
    take advantage of the production tax credit, which is available
    only to projects beginning substantive development before
    2020. Solar capacity is added steadily through 2040, as it
    becomes more cost-competitive as a result of declining capital
    cost and the investment tax credit. The tax credit phases down
    from 30% in 2016 to 10% in 2022 and then remains at that level for utility and commercially operated solar projects but ends
    for residential solar projects.</p>
  <p>    In the No CPP case, natural gas accounts for 38% (150 GW)
    of cumulative capacity additions from 2016–40. The relatively
    steady growth of natural gas capacity, which helps to maintain
    baseload generation and provide grid reliability services, also
    results from continued low natural gas prices.</p>
  <h2><a name="hydropower"></a>Nuclear power generation faces competition
    from natural gas and renewables</h2>
    <p>Decisions to build new nuclear capacity, uprate existing
      reactors, or extend their operating lifetimes depend on the
      cost-competitiveness of nuclear generation in electric power
      markets. Independent power producers [<a class="endnotes">12</a>] have faced financial
      losses in recent years on their nuclear capacity as a result of
      competition from lower-cost energy sources—including natural
      gas and wind—and declining electricity demand and reduced
      capacity payments in some regions [<a class="endnotes">13</a>].</p>

     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt35_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
    <p>Low natural gas prices reduce the competiveness of newly built
      nuclear capacity relative to natural gas-fired combined-cycle
      plants, and they reduce wholesale market prices for electricity
      from existing nuclear power plants. As a result, no uprates or
      new builds of nuclear capacity beyond those already underway
      occur in any of the AEO2016 cases.</p>
    <p>The Reference case incorporates 2,139 megawatts (MW) of
      planned and announced nuclear plant retirements (Figure MT-35), including FitzPatrick (852 MW) in 2016, and Pilgrim (678
      MW) and Oyster Creek (610 MW) in 2019. The Reference case
      also assumes early retirement of 3 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear
      capacity, modeled as derates in competitive regions, based
      on an assessment of market uncertainties. These retirements
      represent a total reduction in nuclear capacity of 5.1 GW from
      the existing nuclear fleet. Market uncertainties and regulatory
      issues have led to recent announcements of reactor retirements
      that are not reflected in the Reference case: Clinton (1,065
      MW), Quad Cities Units 1 and 2 (1,819 MW), Fort Calhoun (479 MW), and Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 (2,240 MW). These
      reecent announcements represent an additional incremental
      reduction of 2.6 gigawatts of retirements not reflected in the
      Reference case. The Reference case addresses near-term
      accelerated nuclear retirements but assumes that subsequent
      license renewals will allow for long-term operation up to 80
      years. Future AEOs will discuss the ability of nuclear power
      stations to achieve long-term operation beyond 60 years.</p>
    <h2><a name="rene_solar" id="rene_solar"></a>Renewable capacity additions are dominated by
      solar photovoltaics</h2>
    <p>In the AEO2016 Reference case, total wind and solar electricity
      generation capacity grows by 5%/year from 2016–40, adding
      more than 294 gigawatts (GW) to provide 80% of total
      renewables capacity in 2040 (Figure MT-36). In the No CPP
      case, which assumes that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is not
      implemented, wind and solar capacity together increase by
      more than 4%/year, adding almost 230 GW of generating
      capacity over the 2016–40 period. Wind and solar capacity
      increases by 10%/year from 2016–20 and then slows to 3%/
      year from 2021–40 in both the Reference and No CPP cases.</p>

     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt37_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
      <p>Solar power provides the largest increase in renewable
        capacity, from 25 GW in 2015 to more than 246 GW in 2040
        in the Reference case and more than 202 GW in the No CPP
        case. The increases in wind capacity are much smaller, at 73
        GW in the Reference case and less than 52 GW in the No CPP
        case from 2016–40. Solar installations have benefitted from
        significant reductions in technology costs in recent years, while
        wind capacity is hampered by the need to access wind sites
        farther from existing transmission lines or with less favorable
        development characteristics. Wind capacity additions are
        particularly slow between 2030–40, at slightly more than 4 GW
        in the Reference case and 2 GW in the No CPP case. With slow
        growth in wind capacity additions and continued fast growth in
        solar additions, solar capacity surpasses wind capacity in 2032
      in the Reference case and in 2033 in the No CPP case.</p>
      <p>Renewable capacity growth is supported by a variety of federal
        and state policies. The recent five-year extension of production
        tax credits and investment tax credits supports the growth of
        new renewable capacity through 2022. The CPP policy takes
        effect in 2022, providing additional incentives for renewable
        capacity additions to meet CO2 emissions targets from 2022–29. Although the targets remain flat after the interim period,
        additions of renewable capacity continue in order to meet CO2<br />
      emissions targets while satisfying demand for new generation.</p>
      <h2><a name="rene_elec_natgas"></a>Renewable electricity generation sensitive to
        government policies and natural gas prices</h2>
      <p>Total renewable electricity generation increases in the Reference
        case by more than 150%, from 546 billion kilowatthours (kWh)
        in 2015 to 1,374 billion kWh in 2040 (Figure MT-37). The total
        varies in the alternative cases with different price, resource,
        and policy assumptions, ranging from a 76% increase in the
        High Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case to a 271%
        increase in the Low Oil and Gas Resource and Technology
        case. Generation from wind and solar resources represents
        the largest share of the increase in renewable generation. In
        the Reference case, solar generation increases by an average
        of 11%/year, from 38 billion kWh in 2015 to 477 billion kWh
        in 2040, and wind generation increases by an average of 4%/year, from 190 billion kWh in 2015 to 473 billion kWh in 2040.
        Solar power provides about 35% of total renewable electricity
      generation in 2040 in the Reference case, up from 7% in 2015.</p>
      <p><img src="images/fig_mt-37.png" /><br />
     <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt36_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
      <p>In the Low Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case, which
        has the highest natural gas prices among all the AEO2016
        cases, renewable generation increases to 2,030 billion kWh in
        2040, with approximately 46% of the total coming from solar
        generation, 31% from wind, and 15% from hydropower. Because
        natural gas often is the marginal fuel in determining wholesale
        electricity prices, higher natural gas prices tend to make
        renewable generation more competitive. Solar generation,
      which is available during the day to meet peak demand and can displace natural gas-fired generation, serves 19% of total load
      in 2040.</p>
      <p>        In the High Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case, low
        natural gas prices reduce growth in total renewable generation,
        which increases to only 961 billion kWh in 2040. Lower natural
        gas prices increase the cost-effectiveness of natural gas-fired
      power plants and make renewable generation less competitive.</p>
      <h2><a name="se_hydro"></a>Southeast region leads growth in nonhydropower
      renewable electricity generation</h2>
      <p>In the AEO2016 Reference case and the No CPP case,
        nonhydropower renewable generation increases from 2020
        to 2040 in all the electricity regions. (For a map of regions,
        see Appendix F.) Regional growth in renewable generation
        is determined by four factors: implementation of the Clean
        Power Plan (CPP), state renewable portfolio standards (RPS),
        availability of renewable energy resources, and cost competition
        with fossil fuel technologies. Factors such as electricity demand
        growth, non-RPS policies (such as net metering), and electricity
      prices also affect regional growth rates.      </p>
      <p>        From 2020–40, the Southeast region experiences the largest
        increases in nonhydropower renewable electricity generation
        both in the Reference case (360%) and in the No CPP case
        (206%), with growth led by utility-scale solar and wind
        capacity additions in the Tennessee Valley and in Florida
        (Figure MT-38). In the Reference case, which includes the
        CPP, nonhydropower renewable generation in the Southeast in
        2040 is the largest among all regions and is 48%, or 70 billion
        kilowatthours (kWh), greater than in the No CPP case. In the
        California and Southwest/Rockies regions, generation from
        nonhydropower renewables doubles from 2020–40 in both the<br />
        Reference and No CPP cases, partly as a result of mandatory
        RPS policies. Solar power leads the growth in nonhydropower
        renewable generation in California, making up more than
      65% of the growth from 2020–40 in both the Reference and No CPP cases. Solar makes up more than 80% of the growth
      in the Southwest/Rockies region in both cases. In Texas,
      nonhydropower renewable electricity generation in 2040 in
      the Reference case is approximately 165% higher than in 2020
      (an increase of more than 80 billion kWh). The growth over the
      same period in the No CPP case is 80% (an increase of nearly
      39 billion kWh).</p>
      <p><img src="images/fig_mt-38.png" /><br />
      <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt38_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
      <p>        Nonhydropower renewable generation growth is generally
        higher with the carbon emission restrictions of the CPP in the
        Reference case than without the restrictions. However, both
        the growth and the resulting generation mix vary substantially
        among regions, depending on the cost and availability of
        resources and state policies.</p>
      
      <h2><a name="lgen"></a>Levelized generation and avoided costs
        influence the economics of new technologies</h2>
      <p>Factors that influence technology choices for new generating
        capacity are difficult to compare. Different technologies
        can have vastly different costs (capital, fuel, maintenance,
        financing), utilization rates, fuel resources, and value to the
        grid. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is often used to
        compare costs among technologies with similar operating
        characteristics; the levelized avoided cost of electricity (LACE)
        is used to compare value across technologies with different
        duty cycles (Figure MT-39). LCOE—which represents the costs
        of building and operating a plant per kilowatthour of output
        over an assumed financial life and activity level (e.g., baseload,
        peaking, seasonal)—can vary significantly across regions and
        over time. Because solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind generation
        have no fuel costs and relatively small variable operation
        and maintenance costs, their LCOE is determined mostly by
        capital and financing costs. LACE, which represents the perkilowatthour
        value of generation to the electric grid, reflects
        the cost of the electricity displaced by the new technology. A
        technology is generally considered economically competitive
      when its LACE exceeds its LCOE.</p>
      <p><img src="images/fig_mt-39.png" /><br />
      <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt39_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
      <p>In comparisons of two new plants using different technologies,
        LCOE may not account for differences in the grid services
        each is providing. For example, nuclear plants and natural gas
        combined-cycle plants both provide baseload services to the
        grid and thus have similar LACE values, even if their LCOE
        values differ. By 2040, the LACE range for most technologies
        is expected to shift upward, indicating the increasing value of
        new generation to the grid as demand for new sources grows.
        Wind plants have increased generation during the night (when
        the demand for and value of electricity typically are low)
        and thus provide a limited contribution to system reliability<br />
        reserves. Solar PV plants produce most of their energy during
        the middle of the day, when higher demand increases the value
        of electricity. Consequently, in 2040, the upper bound of LACE
        for solar PV generation, at 55.7–80.3 dollars/megawatthour
        (MWh), is higher than the upper bound of LACE for wind
        (50.6–65.3 dollars/MWh). In 2022, the lower bound of LCOE
        without tax credits for solar PV generation (not shown) is
        generally much higher than the lower bound for generation with
        tax credits, although available tax credits close the gap in some
        regions. In 2040, the LCOE and LACE ranges for solar PV are
        overlapping, even without the 10% investment tax credit that,
      under current law, would be available for solar PV in 2040.</p>
      <h2><a name="cpprcase"></a>With Clean Power Plan, power plant coal use and sulfur dioxide emissions decline in the Reference case</h2>
      <p>Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from electricity generation have
        declined with reduced coal use. In 2016, SO2 emissions are
        expected to fall by nearly two-thirds from 2015 levels with the
        lapse of extended deadlines for compliance with the Mercury
        and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for almost all generating
        units in April 2016. The MATS rule requires that any coal-fired
        power plant in operation after the deadline must be retrofitted
        to control mercury and acid gases with either dry sorbent
      injection or flue-gas desulfurization (scrubbing) equipment, which also removes 70%–90% of SO2 emissions. Although
      the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) is still in effect and
      covers SO2 emissions from these units, the more stringent
      reduction requirements under MATS render CSAPR irrelevant.</p>
      <p>For some generators, the prospect of meeting MATS compliance
        requirements is uneconomical, based on cost recovery with
        likely lower operating rates for retrofitted coal units in a market
        driven by lower natural gas prices. Even in the No CPP case, a
        cumulative total of 40 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity
        is retired by 2016 and 57 GW by 2020. Utility sector coal use
        increases slightly from 2016–20 with increased utilization, but
        SO2 emissions are largely unchanged as a result of high levels
        of SO2 removal with newly installed retrofits and remain at
      about the same level through 2040.</p>
      <p>        In the AEO2016 Reference case, which includes the requirement
        for power plants in each state to lower CO2 emissions beginning
        in 2022, retirements continue to a cumulative total of 92 GW
        in 2030 and to nearly 100 GW in 2040. As a result, utility coal
        consumption in the Reference Case falls by approximately 35%,
        from 14.3 quadrillion Btu in 2020 to 9.4 quadrillion Btu in 2040
        (Figure MT-40). SO2 emissions also fall by about one-third,
      from 1.2 million tons in 2020 to 0.8 million tons in 2040.</p>

      <h2><a name="elecpower"></a>Electric power sector accounts for 35% of U.S.
        natural gas consumption in 2040</h2>
      <p>Total U.S. natural gas consumption grows from 27.5 trillion
        cubic feet (Tcf) in 2015 to 34.4 Tcf in 2040 in the AEO2016
        Reference case (Figure MT-41). Consumption of natural gas
        for electric power generation increases by 2.4 Tcf, accounting
        for 34% of the total increase. Natural gas consumption was
        at a record high in 2015, which resulted primarily from low
        natural gas prices and the retirement of coal-fired capacity. In
        the Reference case, natural gas use for electricity generation
        declines from 2015–21 as a result of rising natural gas prices
        and increasing use of renewable fuels. With implementation of
      the Clean Power Plan starting in 2022, as well as the reduction or phasing out of some renewable tax credits, and relatively low
natural gas prices, natural gas use for electric power generation
grows by an average of approximately 4%/year from 2021–30
and continues to increase at a more modest pace of just under
1%/year from 2031–40.</p>
      <p><img src="images/fig_mt-41.png" /><br />
      <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/excel/figmt41_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></p>
      <p>Natural gas consumption in the industrial sector, which
        includes the use of natural gas for lease and plant fuel and
        liquefaction of natural gas for export, increases by 3.4 Tcf from
        2015–40, an average increase of 1.3%/year. Energy-intensive
        industries and those that use natural gas as a feedstock, such
        as bulk chemicals, benefit from relatively low natural gas prices
        throughout the projection. Increasing use of lease and plant
        fuel, which is correlated with natural gas production, and fuel
        used for the production of liquefied natural gas for export also
        contribute to the growth of natural gas consumption in the
      industrial sector.</p>
      <p>        Natural gas use in vehicles currently accounts for only a small
        portion of U.S. total natural gas use, but it grows rapidly from 64
        billion cubic feet (Bcf) in 2015 to 658 Bcf in 2040. Heavy-duty
        vehicles and freight rail account for 33% of the natural gas used
        in the transportation sector in 2040 in the Reference case, and
      pipeline compressor stations account for most of the remainder.        </p>
      <p>In the residential sector, natural gas use for space heating
        declines, partially as a result of improvements in energy
        efficiency and population shifts to warmer regions. In the
        commercial sector, where growth in commercial floor space
        more than offsets improvements in energy efficiency, natural
      gas use rises gradually over the projection period.</p>
