      <h1>State energy efficiency resource standards and goals through January 2016</h1>
      
      <p class="release">Release Date: 9/15/2016</p>


<p>In January 2016, 32 states had current or pending efficiency targets, including 22 states that would require utilities (electric, natural
  gas, or both) or third-party administrators to meet energy reduction targets over time. Efficiency policies for utilities complement
  efficiency gained from structural changes, federal appliance standards, and enhanced building codes. The extent of changes in
  demand varies by region and by sector. This section describes policies in states with electricity savings targets that were in effect
  at the end of January 2016 [<a class="endnotes">59]</a>. An energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), or energy efficiency portfolio standard (EEPS), is mandatory, sets long-term reduction targets (at least three years), is sufficiently funded to allow covered entities to meet their targets, uses financial incentives or nonperformance penalties, and usually (but not always) increases over time [<a class="endnotes">60</a>]. Both state legislatures and public utility commissions (PUC) have created energy efficiency (EE) policies. Savings targets may be set as
  reductions from a single base year or from an average of prior years; as a cumulative reduction over a compliance period; or as a percentage of projected electricity sales.</p>
<p>In AEO2016, EIA has explicitly incorporated rebates or incentives offered by utilities to residential and commercial customers to encourage the purchase of more-efficient equipment, which helps meet the goals of the CPP [<a class="endnotes">61</a>]. AEO2016 is the first time the projection has included incentives by technology and sector at a Census division level. AEO2016 also incorporates related efficiency policies, such as federal equipment standards and adoption of residential and commercial building codes, which reduce demand for energy.</p>
<p>  The jurisdictional utilities covered by EERS vary by state. Some states cover only investor-owned utilities (IOUs). Other states use tiered savings targets by utility size, or between IOUs and publicly owned utilities (POUs). Table LR7-1 compares the targets and characteristics of states with statewide EE policies as of January 2016. States with large nonjurisdictional POUs often encourage them to set similar standards [<a class="endnotes">62</a>]. In 7 states the EERS apply to electricity savings only; 15 states set EERS targets for both electric
  and natural gas utilities [<a class="endnotes">63</a>]. Those differences account for variations in the percentage of retail sales covered by the different state EERS (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/table_lr7-1.cfm">Table LR7-1</a>)*(If you need this table printed see PDF version).</p>
<p>Texas established the first EERS in 1997 as part of its electricity restructuring. There was a great deal of activity between 2004 and 2010, and by 2010, 24 states had adopted mandatory EE targets or goals for utilities. Between 2005 and 2008, California and four New England states (Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts) began to adopt all cost-effective energy efficiency
  policies [<a class="endnotes">64</a>]. If states with such efficiency policies also fund mandatory, multi-year programs sufficiently, they are included as states with EERS. Some states—including Vermont and Oregon&#8212;later changed EE goals to long-term requirements.</p>
<p>  No states added EE goals or mandates between 2010 and 2014. Moreover, the direction of adoption shifted in 2013, perhaps because of the recession or to strengthen renewable policies, rather than efficiency policies [<a class="endnotes">65</a>]. New Mexico lowered its final target in 2013, and Nevada began to phase EE out of its RPS. In 2014 and 2015, 4 states acted to slow or stop compliance with an EERS [<a class="endnotes">66</a>], and 11 states enhanced existing EERS, either by extending their time horizons or increasing savings targets. Two
  states opened regulatory proceedings either to adopt EERS or to promulgate EERS regulations, and one state started a pilot EE program [<a class="endnotes">67</a>]. As of January 2016, 22 states had adopted EERS. Six states without EERS have savings targets, including nonbinding efficiency goals, efficiency as a compliance mechanism in an RPS, or EE pilots [<a class="endnotes">68</a>] (Figure LR7-1).</p>
<p><img src="images/fig_lr7-1.png" /><br />
  </p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2014, 18 states have made changes to their EERS or efficiency goals, including 14 states that have increased
  existing savings targets, extended the end years for energy reductions, or established regulations for an EEPS. In addition, four
  states eliminated, froze, or defunded existing targets. Key changes since January 2014 are summarized below.</p>
<h2>Arkansas</h2>
<p>  In December 2015, the Arkansas Public Service Commission extended a 0.9% EERS savings target from the 2015&#8212;16 to the 2017&#8212;18
  program-year, and it raised targets to 1% of 2015 sales in 2019 [<a class="endnotes">69</a>]. The General Assembly passed Act 78 in 2015, which limits the
  extent to which large customers can opt-out of EERS targets [<a class="endnotes">70</a>].</p>
<h2>  California</h2>
<p>  California has an all cost-effective energy efficiency requirement [<a class="endnotes">71</a>]. In October 2014, the PUC updated EERS funding and established 2015 portfolios [<a class="endnotes">72</a>]. In September 2015, the legislature enacted Senate Bill 15-350 [<a class="endnotes">73</a>], which requires establishing annual targets for statewide energy efficiency savings to achieve a cumulative doubling of statewide energy efficiency by January 1, 2030, and includes energy efficiency reductions in existing residential and nonresidential buildings.</p>
<h2>Connecticut</h2>
<p>  Connecticut has an all cost-effective energy efficiency requirement. In December 2015, the state's Department of Energy&amp;  Environmental Protection approved, with conditions, the 2016–18 triennial Conservation and Load Management Plan [<a class="endnotes">74</a>]. The plan
  increased investor-owned electric utility (IOU) targets from 1.4% of electric sales (2013–15) to 1.51%. Connecticut also eliminated
  EE as a means to fulfill its RPS, which could strengthen EE as a separate resource [<a class="endnotes">75</a>].</p>
<h2>  Delaware</h2>
<p>  Delaware has an all cost-effective energy efficiency requirement. The PUC had not established EE regulations or funding for an
  EERS enacted in 2009 [<a class="endnotes">76</a>]. In 2014, the legislature directed the state’s Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU) to provide utilities with
  cost-effective EE programs, established an advisory council to help develop financing mechanisms, and directed the Department of
  Natural Resources to establish energy measurement and verification (EM&amp;V) regulations [<a class="endnotes">77</a>]. Utilities committed to submitting
  plans in 2016 and beginning programs in 2017.</p>
<h2>  Indiana</h2>
<p>  In 2014, Indiana suspended its Energizing Indiana EERS, which had targeted a 2% savings by 2019, relative to 2009 sales [<a class="endnotes">78</a>].
  In 2015, the legislature replaced the EERS with a law that allows voluntary programs and directs utilities to file triennial energy
  efficiency and demand response plans with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission [<a class="endnotes">79</a>].</p>
<h2>  Louisiana</h2>
<p>  In November 2014, the Louisiana PUC implemented Phase I of its voluntary Energy Efficiency Quick Start program [<a class="endnotes">80</a>]. Four IOUs
  offered programs across all sectors that could be implemented quickly and economically. Because each utility hired the same
  third-party administrator and evaluator, they offer similar programs and use a standardized reporting software package and EM&amp;V.</p>
<h2>  Maryland</h2>
<p>  In 2015, the Maryland PUC revised its EERS from one based on per capita reductions to savings based on a percentage of retail
  sales. The new EERS targets a 2% reduction in electricity sales from 2013 weather-normalized gross retail sales by 2020 for five
  large IOUs, in 0.2% annual increments. The previous EERS, EmPOWER Maryland, had a target of a 15% reduction in electricity use
  per capita by 2015 [<a class="endnotes">81</a>].</p>
<h2>  Massachusetts</h2>
<p>  Massachusetts has an all cost-effective energy efficiency requirement. In January 2016, its Department of Public Utilities approved
  the utilities' 2016&#8211;18 plans, developed in conjunction with the state Energy Efficiency Advisory Council [<a class="endnotes">82</a>]. The new plans
  raise energy savings targets for electric utilities from 2.6% in the 2013&#8211;15 plan cycle to 2.93% of projected sales. This plan also
  recognizes the role of demand response for peak load reductions. With the increase, Massachusetts set the highest electricity
  demand reduction target among all the states with EERS.</p>
<h2>Nevada</h2>
<p>  In 2013, Nevada's legislature voted to phase out EE requirements from its revised Energy Portfolio Standard. EE reductions can
  satisfy no more than 20% of compliance in the 2015&#8211;19 period, and they will not be an eligible resource after 2024 [<a class="endnotes">83</a>]. The
  Nevada legislature did not pass a bill for a separate EERS introduced in the 2015 legislative session.</p>
<h2>  New Hampshire</h2>
<p>  New Hampshire's PUC opened a docket in 2015 to establish an EERS [<a class="endnotes">84</a>]. The proceeding seeks input on appropriate goals,
  financing, cost recovery, incentives and penalties, and measurement and evaluation metrics. The regional energy efficiency
  organization, Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership, has provided assistance to the PUC and stakeholders based on its experience
  with existing regional policies and with EM&amp;V.</p>
<h2>  New York</h2>
<p>  In December 2015, the New York Department of Public Service extended energy savings targets under the state's EERS&#8212;which
  requires a 15% reduction below forecasted sales by 2015&#8212;and allocated funds from its Clean Energy Fund. New EE targets will be
  established along with revised cost-benefit tests under the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) proceeding. The REV proceeding
  was opened in 2014 to transform the retail electricity market and overhaul the existing RPS and EERS [<a class="endnotes">85</a>].</p>
<h2>  Ohio</h2>
<p>  In 2014, Ohio froze its RPS and EERS for 2015 and 2016 and changed a number of other requirements for EE savings and peak
  demand reductions [<a class="endnotes">86</a>]. Established in 2008, the EERS had created annual targets leading to cumulative electricity savings of
  22% by the end of 2025 compared with 2009 sales.</p>
<h2>  Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>  In 2015, Pennsylvania's PUC approved Phase III EERS targets for 2016&#8211;21. The targets, which vary by utility, range from 2.6% to 5%
  relative to the load forecast completed in 2010. The PUC also set utility-specific peak demand reduction requirements for utilities
  with at least 100,000 customers [<a class="endnotes">87</a>].</p>
<h2>  Rhode Island</h2>
<p>  Rhode Island has an all cost-effective energy efficiency requirement. The PUC increased the efficiency savings target in the 2015&#8211;17 triennial plan to an annual average of 2.5%, from 2.1% in the 2012&#8211;14 plan [<a class="endnotes">88</a>]. An Executive Order in December 2015 also
  directed state agencies to reduce energy consumption by at least 10% from fiscal year 2014 levels by 2019, and to establish a
  stretch (aspirational) energy efficiency building code [<a class="endnotes">89</a>].</p>
<h2>  Vermont</h2>
<p>  Vermont has an all cost-effective energy efficiency requirement. In 2015, the Vermont Public Service Board approved 2015&#8211;17
  triennial plans both for Efficiency Vermont and for the City of Burlington Electric Department [<a class="endnotes">90</a>]. The plans include annual
  incremental kilowatthour (kWh) savings as well as summer and winter peak reduction targets. Efficiency Vermont is a statewide
  energy efficiency utility operated by the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation.</p>
<h2>  Washington</h2>
<p>  Washington's &quot;Energy Independence Act,&quot; requires utilities with more than 25,000 customers to set biennial targets for all costeffective,
  reliable, and feasible conservation [<a class="endnotes">91</a>]. In December 2015 and January 2016, the state Utilities and Transportation
  Commission approved 2016&#8211;17 plans for three large IOUs, and the Department of Commerce approved plans for 14 publicly
  owned utilities.</p>
<h2>  West Virginia</h2>
<p>  In 2015, West Virginia repealed its Alternative Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, under which energy efficiency had been eligible
  to earn credits. The Governor's statement indicated that changing economic factors had made the act no longer beneficial to the
  state [<a class="endnotes">92</a>].</p>
