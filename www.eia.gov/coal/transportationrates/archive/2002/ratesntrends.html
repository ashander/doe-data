          <p>In this report, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is offering Excel spreadsheet files and data graphs that can be used to address some of the questions often asked about transporting coal. We prepared these data files because much underlying data on coal transportation rates and costs of coal at mines must be withheld from our public Coal Transportation Rate Database (CTRDB). Following the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issuance in 1996 of Orders 888 and 889, establishing principles of open access and information sharing for electric transmission capacity, interest grew in electricity deregulation and private ownership of utilities<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">'</font> integrated assets. In that climate, many utilities that had previously disclosed transportation rates and mine prices changed policy. Those data were declared confidential and, by law, cannot be disclosed at individual company levels or in limited aggregations that analysts or competitors could use to impute the confidential data.</p>
          The Excel spreadsheets, labeled and formatted as printable tables
            in this report, are presented at levels of aggregation that for the
            most part can be released (individual cells must be withheld in
            some cases). They furnish average coal transportation rate statistics,
            corresponding delivered prices, shipping distances, transportation
            modes, origins and destinations, and general contract terms. These
            statistics can be used to find representative rate and cost data
            and chronological trends that would be otherwise unavailable. The
            spreadsheets can be downloaded and, even though some elements may
            be withheld, they can be used or recompiled to examine other issues.
            To that end, we have tried to keep formats and layouts of related
            tables uniform. <br />          <br />
          The Excel tables and graphs are organized in seven
          sections, as follows:		  <br />          <span class="thbshiftrt">Section 1 - Coal Distribution and Receipts<br />
          Section 
          2 - General Coal Transportation Rates, Distances, and Costs<br />

          3 - Coal Transportation Statistics by Demand Region<br />
          Section

          Section 
          5 - Trends in Coal Transportation Contracts<br />
          Section 
          6 - Coal Transportation Rate Database, Metrics and Limitations<br />
          Section
			
		  7 - Summary of 2001 Contract Coal Shipment Details</span><br />
			Sections 1 through 5 are
			introduced in the following Summary and Discussion section. Sections 6 and
			7 are introduced in the final two report sections, of the same names.<br />
			<br />
			The tables in this report were compiled from transportation statistics
			supplied periodically by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and
			the Department of Transportation, Surface Transportation Board. The report
			presents transportation-rate data calculated between specific origins and
			destinations for the most recent period, from 1999 through 2001, and for two
			baseline years, 1979 and 1990. The tables in Section 1 also include data for
			2002 that are available from coal distribution and coal receipts surveys conducted
			by EIA, which provide some insight into coal volume and origin/destination
			trends beyond 2001. Tables based on non-confidential information such as average
			national-level coal transportation distances, tonnages, and transportation
			rates (Section 2, Tables 2.05-2.09), contract information and statistics (Section
			5, Table 5.01 and 5.02), and general database metrics and source information
			(Section 6, all four tables) include data for all years between 1979 and 2001.
			These tables do not include the more detailed origin/destination pair calculations.			<br />
          <br />
          Graphs have also been created from selected statistics that illustrate
          important trends in U.S. coal transportation and distribution. In the
          Summary that follows, only major trends in coal transportation are
          illustrated. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#index!A1">Click here</a> to view

          <h3><strong><em>Summary and Discussion</em></strong></h3>
         
          </font>
          <p>This section describes as background some factors and general trends
            relevant to coal transportation and the use of this report and its
            spreadsheets. The ideal starting point for recent coal transportation
            rate statistics is 1979 - the last full year before the passage of
            the 1980 Staggers Rail Act, which largely deregulated the U.S. rail
            industry. Prior to 1980, rail rates conformed to published tariffs
            regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission; starting in 1980,
            common carrier railroads were encouraged to compete for business
            and allowed to set their own freight rates, with much lessened oversight.
            The earliest data in the CTRDB, EIA's coal transportation rate database,
            are for 1979. Other EIA data, for coal distribution and coal receipts,
            started much earlier. Because EIA was created in late 1977 and because
            of transitions in and redefinitions of energy data mandates, however,
            some 1979 statistics are not available. On the other hand, EIA coal
            distribution and coal receipts data are available more promptly than
            the coal transportation rate and associated data from the FERC biennial
            survey, Form 580. Accordingly, coal distribution and receipts data
            are presented through 2002 whereas FERC Form 580 transportation rate
          data are available only through 2001.</p>
          <p>Since deregulation, average rates for coal transportation contracts
            have declined steadily when measured in inflation-adjusted dollars,
            and in some cases even in nominal dollars. The average coal transportation
            rates per ton, and per ton-mile, are shown below in constant, year
            2000 dollars. </p>
          <table align="center" cellpadding="5">
            <tr><td><a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#figures2.01_2.03!A1"><img src="fig2.01.gif" alt="Figure S1 Trends in Coal Transportation Rates, 1979-2001" name="Fig 2.01" width="494" height="392" border="0" align="middle" /></a></td>
            </tr></table>
          <p>Average contract coal transportation rates began to decline about
            two to five years after implementation of the Staggers Act. The rates
            and related data in the CTRDB and in this report are for coal delivered
            under contract and exclude spot coal purchases, defined as coal deliveries
            scheduled for 12 or fewer months. Starting in 1981, constant-dollar
            rates per ton began to decline but rates per ton-mile increased through
            1984. Interestingly, this shows that rates per ton (that is "flat
            rates") during that period were not yet declining. The rate per ton-mile
            was still increasing, but the statistics show that on average shippers
            were simply purchasing coal less distant from their facilities and
            holding down rates per ton by holding down mileage. This option would
            not have been universally feasible, however, to all shippers depending
            on the terms defined in existing supply contracts. It can be assumed
            that during this period many existing contract rates were renegotiated
            and that it took some years before the changes made much difference.</p>
          <p>Users should take into account that the weighted average data in this report are indeed averages, and that individual rates and mine price outliers are not depicted. In some cases, they can be found in the CTRDB itself, especially prior to 1996. The rates shown are collected primarily from coal burning utilities and are not necessarily the rates available to industrial customers, almost all of whom tend to buy coal under smaller supply contracts. </p>
          <p>The data show that  customers have experienced a range of differences in coal transportation options during the 1979-2001 period. Facilities served by rail can negotiate better rates if there is a competing railroad they can use, or a feasible competing transportation mode. <font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font>Captive<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font>  mines and coal consumers - those located where a single carrier or mode is their only practical transportation option - have long claimed that they were offered only higher, take-it-or-leave-it rates. Barges  generally offer the least expensive transportation rates, and facilities that can take advantage of barge shipment for all or even a significant part of the shipping distance can usually temper transportation costs. Different railroads use different rate structures and have in recent years implemented new requirements, such as automated loading and unloading equipment or 7-day-per-week loading and unloading, that affect supplier and customer overhead costs but are not reflected in rates. Rates charged may be lower for customers that lease or own their own fleet of coal cars. </p>
          <p>Rates vary from one region to another, partly because there are different carriers involved, but also because some regions are well set up for coal transportation and others are not. Coal regions and coal fields and Census Regions and Census Divisions are defined in Figures S2 and S3.</p>

            EIA's coal distribution data are collected from coal producing and
            coal sales companies. Responding companies identify all coal shipped
            by State of origin, by destination States, and by the consuming sectors
            to which the coal was sent. Coal distribution statistics span 1979
            through 2002 and cover all but the smallest coal producers. Although
            producers and distributors may not be aware of occasional secondary
            transfers, their destination and consuming sector data traditionally
            represent a credible upper boundary for coal quantities supplied
            to domestic consumers and to exports. Domestic coal distribution
            increased from 697 million short tons (mmst) in 1979 to 1,071 mmst
            in 2001, declining to 1,051 mmst in 2002 (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table1.01!A1">Table
            1.01</a>).
              <p>At the other end of the supply chain, EIA collects coal receipts
                data from electricity generators, metallurgical coke plants,
                and other industrial consumers. Overall agreement among these
                data, and with related distribution data, is good. Over time,
                collection of receipts data for minor and declining coal consuming
                sectors, such as agriculture, mining, and transportation, became
                impractical. For that reason, there is no grand total representing
                all U.S. coal receipts. Figure S4 illustrates the historical
                relationship between EIA coal distribution and coal receipts
                data at electricity generators. Because electric generation constitutes
                about 90 percent of U.S. coal consumption, Figure S4 closely
                parallels total domestic  coal disposition.

              <p> Coal distribution and receipts data correlated closely during
                the past three decades, as shown, for example, in 1979 and 1990.
                In 1999 through 2002, reported coal receipts declined atypically
                in the electricity sector, relative to reported distribution.
                The discrepancies were caused by the sale during those years
                of former utility-owned generating units to independent, deregulated
                companies that were not required to report fuel receipts to the
                Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the FERC Form 423 survey.
                Coal receipts by the electricity sector include coal delivered
                to “NAICS-22” power plants, that is, to establishments
                engaged principally in the provision of electric power, and exclude
                coal delivered to industrial and commercial facilities that may
                generate electricity as an adjunct to their primary business.
                Starting in 2002, EIA initiated a new data collection survey,
                the Form EIA-423, to collect fuel receipts data from both electricity
                sector and industrial or commercial generators with a capacity
                of 50 megawatts or greater.<br />
                <br />
                The data collected on the new EIA-423 survey substantially reduced
                the discrepancy in receipts compared to distribution. The persistence
                of a smaller discrepancy is likely attributable to lags between
                the time when a sold power plant stopped reporting receipts to
                FERC and the time when the plant was picked up on the EIA-423
                survey, and by difficulties defining all qualifying survey respondents.
                Adding to the discrepancy was a lapse in statutory authority
                for FERC’s Form 423 survey in 2001.<br />
                <br />
                The dark blue bars in Figure S4 show reported coal distribution
                and illustrate the gap between distribution and reported coal
                receipts from 1999 through 2001. The receipts data are rounded
                out more fully by adding EIA’s
                estimates (2000 and 2001) and the author’s
                estimate (1999) of coal receipts at nonutilities and nonresponsive
                FERC-423 utilities (gray hachure-patterned bars). The yellow
                hachure-patterned bar segment represents residual non-reporting
                by utilities and nonutilities even after EIA and FERC-423 surveys
                were resestablished. Since reported coal consumption data were
                relatively fully reported, non-reporting of coal receipts could
                be approximated by using the electricity sector coal consumption
                for 1998 through 2002, minus reported coal receipts, adjusted
                for year-to-year electricity sector stock changes. These differences
                were added to the 1999 through 2002 coal receipts in Figure S4.<br />
                <br />
                Discrepancies between coal distribution and receipts data also
                expanded, beginning in 1999, because increasing tonnages of coal
                were processed at coal synfuel plants. Most of the synfuel produced
                is believed to have been received
               and consumed, ultimately, at electric power plants, with lesser
               amounts at metallurgical coke plants and other industrial plants
                (light blue bars, figures S4 to S6). In order to preclude double
                counting of coal and coal synfuel consumption, EIA treats coal
                transferred to synfuel plants as distributed to the Other Industrial
                sector, where it is transformed (not consumed) into a manufactured
                fuel product. It is possible that coal producers or distributors
                reported minor amounts of the coal processed at co-located or
                nearby synfuel plants (many of which were partly owned by electric
                power producers) as distributed to the electricity sector. Further,
                quantities of coal receipts at coal synfuel plants were not surveyed
                until the 2001 calendar year, and early response rates were incomplete
                due to frequent changes in locations and ownership of the synfuel
                plants. </p>
              <p>Figure S5, showing coal distribution and receipts at metallurgical
                coke plants, reflects the steel industry transition over the
                past two decades to less coke-intensive ways of producing iron
                and increased use of electric arc furnaces. Electric arc furnaces
                use scrap iron or steel as feedstock, which is remelted, reducing
                the need for highly coke-dependant blast furnace metal.  Coal receipts
                to produce coke for blast furnaces and smelters declined from
                78 mmst in 1979 to 24 mmst in 2002. The difference between distribution
                and receipts - 2 to 5 mmst between 2000 and 2002 - may indicate
                misidentification of the consuming sector for some distribution
                and/or the fact that some of the receipts at coke plants in that
                period were classified as coal synfuel or came from imported
              coal. <br />
              <br />
              For 2001 and 2002, EIA has supplied approximations of synfuel coal
              receipts at coke plants (Table S5). There was no source of data
              on synfuel coal receipts during that period. EIA used 1998 through
              2002 data on total coal delivered to synfuel plants, adjusted by
              the ratio of consumption of normal coal at coke plants to consumption
              of normal coal for the total U.S. The ratio was 0.061 and the assumption
              was that essentially 100 percent by weight of coal received
              at synfuel plants is converted to salable synfuel during each year.              </p>
              <p>Figure S6 illustrates the gap, beginning in 2000, between coal distribution and receipts 
		  at the Other Industrial sector. In 2000, a clear shortfall in receipts data resulted in part from 
		  the absence of data collection authority at coal synfuel plants. In 2001 and 2002, with receipts at 
		  synfuel plants being surveyed, the impact of their operation was evident. By 2002, more than half of 
		  all coal received in the Other Industrial sector was dedicated to synfuel operations.<br />
            <br />
There is the possibility that some of the “coal” receipts seen in
the lower, pink bars in Figure S6 included coal synfuel. The 1998 through 2002
ratio of (normal) coal consumed by other industrial plants to total coal consumed
in the U.S. was small: 0.026, or 2.6 percent. It is reasonable to assume—and
there is evidence to support—that some manufacturing plants have consumed
synfuel coal. If, as with coal, those plants accounted for 2 to 3 percent of
total synfuel consumption, from 2000 through 2002 that would equate to 1 or 2
mmst of coal synfuel annual receipts at industrial plants, that may also have
been counted (i.e., double-counted) as receipts at the synfuel plants, both within
the Other Industrial sector.            <!--INSERT THUMBNAIL FOR FIGS. 1.02, 1.03-->

The tables also show coal tonnages shipped to each demand region in each indexed year, in total, by mode of transport, and by coal sulfur content ranges. The last five tables, 3.10 through 3.14, present statistics on coal transport costs for the same years but broken out by three ranges in contract size (based on actual tonnage shipped). The data in these tables are useful for comparing coal delivery cost differences among regions, over time, and based on size of contract. <br />

            <p>In this grouping the tables include "snapshots" of coal transportation statistics assembled by supply region (coal field), for the years 1979, 1990, 1999, 2000, and 2001. For the five major producing coal fields (Central and Northern Appalachia, the Illinois and Powder River Basins, and the Rockies) non-withheld data are sufficient to show trends in transportation rates, which are shown in five sets of graphs. The data in the tables are useful for comparing coal delivery cost differences typical of the coal field supply regions, with changes over time. The tables show contract coal tonnages shipped from each coal field  in each indexed year, in total, by mode of transport, and by coal sulfur content ranges. Where available, data for rail data have been added showing the rates and costs, and tonnages covered, for contract coal delivered in shipper-owned cars. Over the years, many utilities leased or purchased their own fleets of coal cars - usually of higher than average capacity - with the understanding that such shippers would be eligible for lower rail rates from the carriers.<br />

            5.01 - 5.08</a>)</font></strong>
            <p> As recently as 1998, the majority of active coal contracts covered
              in the CTRDB were, when first signed, written for periods of 11
              years or longer, including 23.1 percent of existing contracts 
              in the CTRDB that had originally been written for 31 years or longer  (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table5.02!A1">Table 5.02</a>).


Contracts written for 35 years  were not uncommon in the mid-1970s, and some
              of those may still be in effect.

 In view of continuously declining coal prices during the 1980s and 1990s, coal
              customers grew disaffected with new long-term contracts. With excess
              capacity in the coal industry, customers were able to set shorter
              terms for new contracts or renegotiate old contracts. It seemed
              more practical to coal buyers to limit contracts to 5 to 10 years
              and be well positioned to lock in later to (presumably) still lower
          prices. Another trend that developed was including<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font>reopeners<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font> in new contracts - options that would permit customers to renegotiate prices at set times or per specific financial indices. </p>
            <p>According to EIA statistics, average mine prices for coal (comprising both contract and spot sales) declined steadily throughout the 1990s. The decline started to reverse in 2000, continued upward during 2001 and 2002, and is expected to have increased again in 2003. Based on CTRDB data, nearly 97 percent of all new coal contracts written from 1999 through 2001 run for 5 years or less <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table5.07!A1">(Table 5.07)</a>. Anecdotal information indicates that neither coal suppliers nor coal customers wanted longer contracts during those years-suppliers because prices in play were too low to sustain economic mining and customers because many electricity producers were in financial straits, had sufficient coal to postpone major purchases, and were convinced or hopeful that coal prices would eventually turn down again.<br />

                <br />
                The CTRDB is a comprehensive database that contains electric utility coal supply contract data and transportation-related data. The data for this system are part of the detailed <font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font>Interrogatory on Fuel and Energy Purchase Practices<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font> collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Form 580. The survey is conducted every 2 years. It requires responses from all jurisdictional utilities that either operate or have ownership interest in at least one steam-electric generating station with a capacity of 50 megawatts or greater. Jurisdictional utilities, as defined under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, are facilities involved in the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric power at wholesale in interstate commerce. Jurisdictional utilities must file only if they use the Act’s Fuel Adjustment Clause to set electricity rates. <br />
                  <br />
                  Because of its specified authority, FERC collects no information
                  on Form 580 for a significant portion (52 percent in 2001)
                  of the contract coal consumed at and transported to U.S. electric
                  utilities. In order to improve the coverage of the CTRDB and
                  to provide a more comprehensive view of transportation rates,
                  supplementary data are obtained from FERC Form 423, <font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font>Monthly
                  Report of Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants,<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font> and
                  from the Surface Transportation Board (STB), annual <font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font>Carload
                  Waybill Sample.<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font> The
                  FERC 423 data are used to estimate missing transportation rate
                  data using its delivered prices and Form 580 mine prices. For
                  utilities not covered by Form 580 at all, the CTRDB has been
                  augmented with confidential transportation rates and shipping
                  distances computed from STB waybill samples.
                  <p></p>
                Starting with the 1998/1999 FERC Form 580 update, EIA opted to include in the CTRDB certain coal transportation rate and distance data from the STB Waybill Sample that meet EIA's quality assurance criteria but do not match deliveries of record to electric utilities. Such deliveries are believed to go to nearby industrial consumers. No actual coal supply contract information is associated with STB waybill data prepared for EIA and actual consumers are not identified. EIA uses STB extracts of waybill data by counties of origin and destination for coal delivered to counties where Form 580 nonreporting utilities are located, and matches waybill delivery data with mine of origin counties and tonnages from FERC Form 423. The conclusion that certain waybill data represent coal deliveries to major industrial coal consumers is based on the coal sources and quantities and on the existence of industrial development in the destination counties. EIA identifies the <font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font>Utility<font  face="Courier New, Courier, mono">"</font> for those data as "Industrial Coal," and assigns dummy contract codes numbered between 5900 and 5999. </div>
                <p>The FERC Form 580 records contained within the CTRDB are contract- and route-oriented. For each utility plant receiving coal under a specific contract, the CTRDB provides an origin-to-destination record for every route over which that plant's coal flows. A contract record within the CTRDB can be broken down into four subsets of data fields: contract accounting and specification information, plant information, route information, and transportation mode information. A utility company within the database can have several coal supply contracts; one coal supply contract can serve several plants; an individual plant can receive coal from one supplier but sourced at several mines on the same contract; and an individual plant can be covered by several different contracts. Contract accounting, coal specifications, transportation and cost factors, and other details are described in the CTRDB file layout and Users Manual found in READMEpublic.doc supplied with CTRDB file downloads: <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/ctrdb/database.html">http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/ctrdb/database.html</a>. <br />
          
          </p><div align="left"><font color="#000099" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Relationship to Other Data Systems and Coverage<br />
          <br />
            </strong></font>Since the CTRDB is drawn primarily from the FERC Form 580 survey, its data consistency and coverage can be described in the context of Form 580 and its relationship to other data systems. The Form 580 survey population is a subpopulation within FERC’s survey population for Form 423, "Monthly Report of Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Utilities." Form 580 covers jurisdictional public utilities while Form 423 covers all public utilities, i.e., investor-owned utilities, federally owned utilities, municipalities, and cooperatives. The Form 580 survey is conducted every 2 years, while the Form 423 survey is conducted monthly.
            <p></p>
          </div>
            <p>As of 1993, FERC Form 423 covered approximately 235 utilities
              and 700 fossil-fueled power plants (coal, oil, and natural gas).
              Of those utilities, 173 utilities received coal at 412 power plants.
              FERC Form 580 in 1993 covered 117 utilities and 292
              fossil-fueled plants. As of 2001, the Form 423 coverage
              was down to 198 utilities and 605 fossil-fueled plants, of which
              149 utilities and 343 plants had coal receipts. The Form 580 coverage
              for utilities with coal-fired plants was down to 83 utilities at
              218 plants. (Coal-fired power plants are generally larger than
              oil- or natural gas-fired plants, so their net generation is relatively
              larger than the plant counts may imply.) Form 580 collects data
              for utility contract purchases only, however, whereas Form 423
              collects data for both contract purchases and spot purchases. Spot
              purchases are purchase orders to obtain coal for a period of less
              than 1 year. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table6.01!A1">Table
              6.01</a> shows
              the breakout of Form 423 tonnage into contract and spot totals,
              CTRDB coal tonnages from Form 580 only and augmented with data
              from other sources (see below), and the augmented tonnage as a
              percentage of both the FERC 423 total tonnage and the FERC 423
              contract tonnage.</p>
            <p>Although both surveys collect data on utility contract purchases
              of coal, most utilities must report contract purchases on Form
              423 but many are exempted from Form 580 reporting requirements.
              Thus, the Form 423 coverage and the contract tonnage reported is
              higher than for Form 580. Contract tonnage is the most useful variable
              to measure consistency of reporting for the two systems. In order
              to obtain a more comprehensive record of contract tonnage, the
              Form 580 contract tonnage was augmented with data derived from
              the Surface Transportation Board (STB) Carload Waybill Sample.
              The resulting contract tonnage in the CTRDB is the combination
              of Form 580 contract tonnage and STB Carload Waybill Sample derived
              contract tonnage. The total contract coal received at U.S. utilities
              in 2001 was 607.8 mmst according to Form 423. The 289.0 mmst of
              contract tonnage recorded by the CTRDB from Form 580 constitutes
              47.6 percent of the Form 423 contract coal receipts. The CTRDB
              augmented tonnage totaled 486.7 mmst in 2001, which would account
              for 80.1 percent of the Form 423 contract tonnage total. It can
              be assumed that the augmented total includes both contract and
              spot tonnage because the STB survey does not collect contract information;
              however, the STB data are incorporated into the CTRDB only if they
              reflect compatible values with the analogous contract data from
              Form 580.</p>
            <p>Survey  differences contribute to four sources of variations between
              FERC Form 580 and FERC Form 423 data series: (1) differences in
              surveyed populations or statutory requirements, (2) different reporting
              periods, (3) requirements based on electric generating station
              capacity (steam-electric generating station and peaking units with
              either 24 megawatts or 50 megawatts minimum nameplate
              capacity could have reported on either survey, depending on the
              requirements at the time), and (4) data reporting procedures, data
              recording, and processing procedures for the two systems.</p>
            <div align="left"><font color="#000099"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Data Reliability and Quality</font></strong></font></div>
            <p>The FERC manages all quality control issues, mandates the type of data collected, and handles nonresponses and respondent contact records for the FERC Form 580. Quality assurance measures in the extraction of data from Form 580 responses are handled by the EIA, but EIA is not authorized to contact Form 580 respondents. Efforts are made to rectify coding errors, tabulation errors, keying errors, and problems of data interpretation. Because the data are not collected primarily for input into the CTRDB, however, FERC 580 responses may contain estimates or averages of transportation rates for several shipments under one contract and estimates of volumes and distances of shipments. </p>
            <p>An error detection and correction program is used to detect and correct errors that escape manual screening. This program consists of a set of ranges and range checks for all quantitative data fields within the database. The range values were established in coordination with FERC personnel. When the database is evaluated using this program, values that fall outside of pre-established ranges are identified for investigation. Internal inconsistencies are corrected using a program that compares values from year to year to detect outliers based on the series of values. This program also resolves problems of record redundancy. Table presentations are also examined for regional and national transportation data consistencies. Data record printouts are reviewed and outliers are eliminated where deemed necessary. </p>
            <p>For a few specific demand regions, supply regions, and/or transportation modes, time series data vary considerably from one year to the next. In most cases, this appears to be due to the small number of records for which transportation rate data were available for that particular region or transportation mode. In those cases, fluctuations in tonnage or rates for one contract could have a substantial influence on the regional average. This situation occurs most frequently for shipments from the "Other Western Interior" region and for shipments by truck and "other" transportation modes (primarily conveyors). </p>
            <div align="left"><strong><font color="#000099" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Data Availability</font>
            </strong></div>
            <p>The CTRDB data are based on public use data from the FERC 580 for the years 1979 through 1987 and both public use and confidential data for 1988 through 2001. For the years 1979 through 2001, data that were unavailable for public use due to confidentiality consisted of coal transportation rates and mine price. Also, some records did not have complete data. To minimize the skewing of statistical calculations, records with missing data were excluded from certain calculations. Furthermore, an effort was made to increase the availability of data through derivation in two ways: (1) when two of the three cost data elements were available, the third one was derived from the available data; i.e., if mine price and delivered price were available, the transportation rate was derived by subtracting the mine price from the delivered price; and (2) certain FERC 580 confidential data were made available for the years 1988 through 2001 under an agreement between EIA and the FERC to display the confidential data only in an aggregated form. A similar arrangement with the STB protects confidentiality of waybill data extracts by displaying results only in aggregated forms.</p>
            <p> The availability of data on coal transportation rate per ton, distance, and tonnage is important because these variables are used in the calculation of the average distance shipped, average transportation rate per ton, and average transportation rate per ton-mile. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table6.02!A1">Tables 6.02</a>, <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table6.03!A1">6.03</a>, and <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table6.04!A1">6.04</a> show the number of records and tonnage contained in the CTRDB, the number of records and tonnage obtained from Form 580, the number of supplementary records and tonnage in addition to Form 580, and the number of records and tonnage with incomplete data. The data for  Tables 6.02, 6.03, and 6.04 include all transportation modes.</p>
            <p>The incomplete data in <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table6.02!A1">Table 6.02</a> represent records that do not contain data for the distance shipped. The tonnages for these records are not included in the calculation for average distance. In 2001 there were only 29 records out of 727 that did not contain data for distance, as a result 39.6 mmst of coal were disqualified from the average distance shipped calculation. </p>
            <p>Similarly, the incomplete data for <a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table6.03!A1">Table
                6.03</a> represent records that do not contain data for the transportation
                rate per ton. In 2001 there are currently 342 records that do
                not contain transportation rate data and 125.5 mmst are disqualified
                from the calculation of average transportation rate per ton mile.
                Note, however, that additional data from eleven utilities with
                incomplete rate data in 2000 and 2001 are being sought by FERC
                and are expected soon.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2002/coaltrans.xls#table6.04!A1">Table 6.04</a> shows the data available for the calculation of the average transportation rate per ton-mile. The incomplete data for Table 6.04 takes into account records that are missing both distance data and transportation rate data. Since this is a summation of data from Tables 6.02 and 6.03 there are more incomplete records (371) and tonnage (165.1 mmst) disqualified for the calculation of the average transportation rate per ton-mile. Again, the additional data from eleven utilities is expected soon and will help correct the thinness of 2000 and 2001 rate data. <br />
