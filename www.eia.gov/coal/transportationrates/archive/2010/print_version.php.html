<h1>Background</h1>
<p>In this latest release of Coal Transportation Rates to the Electric  Power Sector, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) significantly  expands upon prior versions of this report with the incorporation of new EIA  survey data. 
<span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2010/images/usrailshipments.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2010/images/usrailshipmentssm.png" alt="Figure 1. Percent of total U.S. rail shipments represented in data" width="340"  /></a><span class="caption"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2010/excel/usrailfig_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span>
Previously, EIA relied  solely on data from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), specifically  their confidential Carload Waybill Sample. While valuable, due to the statistical nature of the Waybill data, much  of the information had to be withheld for confidentiality reasons. With this current release, EIA augments STB  data with EIA's Power Plant Operations Report (EIA-923) data. Unlike the Waybill sample, EIA-923 survey data are intended to be a full population data set. Utilizing the EIA-923 Survey's much larger  data coverage enables EIA to publish data over numerous routes that were  previously withheld, especially for state to state rates.</p>
<p>Another feature of this  release is the incorporation for the first time of coal transport rates by barge  and truck. As a relatively new survey  field however, barge and truck data currently comprise a limited time  series. Further analysis will be  conducted as more data are collected; however, three years (2008-2010) are  included in this initial release.</p>
<p>This  report covers railroad transportation rates from 2001-2010 and barge and truck  rates from 2008-2010. STB data covers  2001-2009 and the newly incorporated EIA data extends over the period of  2008-2010. EIA is pleased to note that,  for future releases, using EIA survey data rather than solely relying on the  STB Waybill will enable EIA to significantly improve the timeliness of this  report, releasing data within several months of collection.</p>

<h1>Trends, 2001 - 2010</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:22px">Transportation infrastructure overview</h2>
<p>In  2010, railroads transported over 70 percent of coal delivered to electric power  plants which are generally concentrated east of the Mississippi River and in  Texas.  The U.S. railroad market is dominated  by four major rail companies that account for 99 percent of U.S. coal rail shipments  by volume.</p>

<p> The Powder River Basin of  Wyoming and Montana, where coal is extracted in huge surface mines and sold at  <a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/news_markets/" title="See Coal News and Markets for coal prices">prices</a> of around $8 to $15 per ton, is by far the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=2770" title="See Today in Energy article">largest supplier</a> of coal for U.S. power plants. Much of this  coal is transported in unit trains of 120 coal cars going from a single mine to  a single power plant over distances that can exceed 1,000 miles (<a id="map" href="print_version.php.html#data">Interactive map</a> and Figure 2).</p>
<p>East  of the Mississippi&mdash;where river systems are well-developed&mdash;transport by barge  often is lower cost than rail when sellers and buyers are located on or near  river systems (Figure 3). Truck, used mainly for short transport distances, is  the third largest (by tons hauled) transport mode for coal (Figure 4).</p>

<h2 style="font-size:22px">National overview</h2>
<p><strong>Nominal</strong> <strong>rates</strong> for transporting coal by rail from  mines to electric generators increased 46 percent nationally from $11.83 to  $17.25 per ton over 2001-2010, an average increase of 4.3 percent annually (Table 1 and Figure 5). 
<span><a href="images/figure5lg.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2010/images/figure5sm.png" alt="Figure 5. U.S. average rail transport cost of coal to electric generating plants" width="340"  /></a><span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure5_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span>
Rates grew slowly in  the early decade and then picked up steam, including a 10.5 percent spike in  2005, with relatively large increases until 2009 when the wake of the recession  impacted shipping rates, causing a 2.3 percent decline in national rates. 
Prices quickly recovered however, growing 9.2  percent in 2010 to reach $17.25, six percent above the pre-recession annual  average peak (or three percent higher in real terms).</p>
<p><strong>Real rates</strong> (Chain-type Price Index, 2005) increased 19 percent nationally from 2001-2010. While rail transportation costs increased from  $13.04 to $15.54 per ton (19 percent), total delivered coal prices rose from  $27 to $40 per ton, almost 50 percent. Most of the increase occurred after 2004. Since coal commodity prices rose faster than  transport costs, the share transportation costs comprised of total delivered  cost fell from 48 percent to 39 percent. In dollar per ton terms, transport added $3 dollars while mine prices  increased $11 over the 2001-2010 timeframe.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:22px">Regional breakdown</h2>
<p>The U.S. average price masks substantial swings in  real regional prices among the six major U.S. coal basins over the period  2001-2010, ranging from a 14 percent increase for Powder River Basin rates, to  149 percent for Southern Appalachia (Figure 6). 
<span><a href="images/figure6lg.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2010/images/figure6sm.png" alt="Figure 6. Average rail transport cost of coal to the power sector by major coal basin" width="340"  /></a><span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure6_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span>
Though this represents a  sizable increase for coal originating from Southern Appalachia, the coal  volumes are small.</p>
<p>In  contrast to the national picture, average coal transport rates originating from  Uinta (principal coal-producing regions of Colorado and Utah, see <a id="map" href="print_version.php.html#data">Interactive map</a>),  Central Appalachian (CAPP), and Southern Appalachian (SAPP) Basins rose rapidly  from 2001 through 2007, moderated thereafter, and by 2010 fell slightly from their  earlier peak values (Figure 6). Coal  originating from the Illinois Basin (ILB) experienced rising rail rates until  2005, declining rates from 2005 to 2007, and rapidly rising rates after  2007. Rail transport rates for coal  originating from the Northern Appalachian (NAPP) and Powder River Basins (PRB)  had a moderate upward trend over the 2001-2010 period. Annual real growth rates per short ton (2005 dollars) for each basin are indicated in the table below.</p>

<p>In spite of having the  largest increase from 2008-10 (47 percent), Illinois Basin coal remained the least expensive for  transportation with real rates of $9.96 per ton. Central Appalachian Basin, the highest cost on  a dollar per ton basis with real rates of $19.53 per ton, traded the top spot  with Uinta Basin several times from 2001 through 2010. Coal delivered from ILB and Appalachian  basins to various states experienced some of the largest increases in rail  transport rates between 2001 and 2010. Conversely, coal deliveries from PRB to Missouri, Texas, Illinois, and  Oklahoma had some of the smallest rate increases, even on a dollar per million  Btu basis. While some routes for PRB  experienced above-average rate increases (deliveries to Minnesota and Nebraska),  in the case of deliveries to Iowa and Kansas, PRB rates actually fell from  2001-2010.</p>
<p> When the national and regional rate data are further disaggregated at the state  to state level, changes reveal rather dramatic disparities. While the average real rate for shipping coal  from a mine to a coal power plant by rail increased 19 percent nationwide  between 2001 and 2010, average rates between specific states varied widely,  ranging from a decline of 23 percent (Wyoming to Kansas) to an increase of 83  percent (Virginia to Tennessee) &mdash; a 106  percentage point swing. 
<span><a href="images/figure7lg.png" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2010/images/figure7sm.png" alt="Figure 7.  State-to-state percent change in rail transport rates to electric power sector, 2001 through 2010." width="340"  /></a><span class="caption"><a href="excel/figure7_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span>
Figure 7 shows  the percent change in average real rates for those state-to-state routes for  which data was able to be published over the time period. The Figure shows that  10 state-to-state pairs experienced a 50 percent or higher increase in real  rates. All of these pairs, except the route from Wyoming to Minnesota, had coal origins east of the  Mississippi River. Five state-to-state pairs, three with western origins and  two with eastern origins, had declining real rates over the 2001-2010 period.</p>
<p><b>Barge and truck transportation costs</b> of  coal to electric generating plants for 2008-2010 averaged between $4.46 and  $5.77 per ton (real 2005 dollars). Rates fell during the recession in 2009, but  rebounded slightly in 2010 (Table 2). Barge and truck rates are quite variable  at the state-to-state level (Tables 15 through 18).</p>
<p>Barge  transport makes up less than 1 percent of western coal, however, significant  river transportation networks in the east enable it to comprise almost  one-third of coal transportation. Truck  transportation over short distances comprises around 10 percent of coal  transportation.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:22px">Coal  to <strike>gas</strike> <em>coal</em> switching: A look  at competing coal basins</h2>
<p>Significant coal to gas  displacement in the electric power sector has resulted in natural gas and coal  generation <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=6990">reaching  parity</a> in the United States in 2012. This trend is often referred to as coal to  gas &lsquo;switching&rsquo;, though it typically involves increased utilization of gas  plants in the generating fleet rather than physically switching out coal  boilers to gas burning ones in a particular plant. Nonetheless, preceding significant  coal to gas switching was a different switch affecting coal markets: PRB coal displacing  Appalachian coal. EIA examined the changing basin footprints in the eastern  U.S. and the role transportation costs played in the outcome.</p>
<p>Production and delivery  points were mapped by basin with their total delivered costs to determine which  was lowest. While coal from all three  Appalachian Basins (Northern, Central, and Southern), Illinois Basin, and  Powder River Basin compete within the eastern United States, for this report  EIA analyzed PRB and CAPP, the major basins in play.</p>
<p>In order to approximate the economically optimal  coal basin for a geographic area, the eastern U.S. was divided into small cells  which were assigned an actual or estimated delivery cost based on EIA-923  Survey data. Each plant receiving CAPP or  PRB coal in 2007 and 2010 were mapped and their data used to estimate costs for  other cells by interpolating values based on inverse distance weights, a  statistical method for conducting spatial analysis. Comparing the total delivery cost in each  cell allows delineation of the eastern U.S. between PRB and CAPP as the most  economical basin.</p>

<span><a href="images/figure8lg.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="https://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/archive/2010/images/figure8sm.jpg" alt="Figure 8.  Lowest delivered cost by coal basin."  /></a></span>

<p>Figure  8  shows the estimated optimal economic area between CAPP and PRB for 2007 and 2010: CAPP is strong in light shaded areas, PRB in darker. Costs for CAPP include the sum of mine prices  and transport costs. For PRB, the same  variables apply but, in addition, EIA added a $1/million Btu charge on top to  approximate additional costs of having a lower heat content coal (i.e. larger  boilers, bigger storage and handling areas, lower efficiency). <em>Note: this $1 adder was determined based on  research by the U.S. Department of Energy and was only incorporated into the  GIS analysis below; it is not in any other elements of this report.</em> <em>See  Methodology for greater detail.</em></p>
<p>The  resulting assessment shows a stark deterioration in the regional competitiveness  of CAPP coal compared to PRB over the timeframe (2007-2010). CAPP delivered coal prices in 2010 ranged  from $2.13 to $7.69 per million Btu while PRB costs (including assumed $1  adder) ranged from $1.80 to $5.16 per million Btu (both in Btu weighted annual  average, nominal dollars). In 2007,  prior to subsequent price increases, CAPP was price competitive over the wider  Ohio River Valley, the northeast, and most of the southeast with the exception  of Mississippi and Alabama. Only three  years later, CAPP had been displaced over most of the Midwest outside of the  Ohio River and virtually all of the Southeastern United States. Outside of its immediate production area,  CAPP maintained its advantage over the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>The  decline in competitive market area for CAPP can be attributed entirely to mine price. From 2007-2010, delivered coal prices per  million Btu increased, on average, by 53 percent for CAPP compared to 22  percent for PRB. Upon further  examination of the data, this divergence was in spite of changes in rail  transportation costs. Rail transport  costs for CAPP coal increased by less than half a percent from 2007-2010. PRB rates for coal transportation increased  by an average of 18 percent over the same period, effectively slowing the  erosion of CAPP's relative competitiveness to PRB. Rather, mine prices account for virtually all  of the change in final CAPP coal delivered prices between 2007 and 2010. In only three years, these higher prices for  CAPP steam coal (especially in light of recent low natural gas prices) have  eroded much of its domestic market potential.</p>

						        		<h1>Methodology</h1>
        								<p><span></span></span>EIA uses the confidential version of the STB Waybill  data, which includes actual revenue for shipments that originate and terminate  at specific locations. The STB Waybill data are a sample of all rail shipments. <a href="../index.cfm.html">EIA's 2011 report</a> describes the sampling procedure. EIA aggregates the confidential STB data to  three different levels: national, coal-producing basin to state, and state to  state. EIA applies STB withholding rules to the aggregated data to identify  records that must be suppressed to protect business-sensitive data. Also, EIA  adds additional location fields to the STB data, identifying the mine from  which the coal originates, the power plant that receives the coal, and, in some  cases, an intermediate delivery location where coal is terminated by the  initial carrier but then transported to the ultimate customer under a new waybill.  These latter multiple-leg shipments are excluded from the data used to  calculate the reported STB transport rates. Otherwise, there is the possibility  that the calculated rates to states such as Missouri and Illinois&#8212;which have  key intermediate junction points&#8212;could be skewed.</p>
						<p><a href="../../../../tools/survey/index.html#eia-923">Form EIA-923 data</a> contains data fields to identify coal supplier down to mine name, mine state  and mine county, coal user down to power plant name and state location,  transport mode, total delivered cost, coal cost at the mine, and tons shipped.  From data representing the full population, EIA eliminates all the records that  either do not have any data for calculating transport rates or records with  imputed transportation data. For each origin-destination pair, there can be  multiple records within a year accounting for different mines, power plants and  by-month data. EIA examines the data at the mine-power plant level to identify  and eliminate outliers. EIA also applies withholding rules to the EIA-923 data  to protect business-sensitive data.</p>
<p>The two data sets &mdash; STB  and EIA &mdash; differ in terms of purpose, transport modes for which data are gathered, and  the sample sizes of the respective surveys. The STB Waybill is a billing-year accounting mechanism which only surveys rail transport whereas the EIA surveys all modes  transporting coal. As stated above, the  STB data are a sample survey (<a href="../../index.html">http://www.eia.gov/coal/transportationrates/</a> ) whereas the EIA-923 data are intended to be a full population data set or  census. EIA estimates transport cost as  the difference between total delivered cost and commodity cost. In 2008, EIA revised Form EIA-923 to include  commodity cost. When new elements appear  in a data survey form, a typical outcome is that a few respondents provide no  data because internal accounting may be difficult or missing, or respondents  provide inconsistent or nonsensical data (which is not included in data  reported by EIA). </p>
<p>For example some  respondents in 2008 provided the same amounts when they reported free-on-board  commodity cost and delivered cost. EIA  implemented follow-up with respondents to clarify instructions and,  consequently, the coverage of the EIA-923 survey has tended improve from the  levels first experienced in 2008.</p>

<p>In the tables that accompany this report, EIA  has calculated coverage rates for both STB and EIA data, according to the level  of aggregation (national, basin to state, or state to state) for the data.</p>
<p>For example (see last  two columns of Table 1), at a national level, in 2008, out of all coal  shipments by rail to electric power plants reported on the EIA-923 survey 83  percent of the shipments (by tons) had acceptable free-on-board commodity and  final delivered costs. By 2010, 90  percent of shipments (by tons) had acceptable cost data. The coverage rates for the EIA-923 data  should improve as more problems are resolved in subsequent years. In comparison, the coverage rate of the STB  data (aggregated to a national level) has remained around 33 to 36 percent for  the period 2001-2009 (Table 1). Unit  trains&#8212;at a 50% sampling rate&#8212;are the most densely sampled shipments in the STB  data. As more coal is shipped on unit  trains, the coverage rates for the STB data can increase but can never exceed 50  percent.</p>
<p>Under existing confidentiality policies, STB and EIA  rates are withheld from publication when the number of respondents is so low  that some respondents can back-calculate costs of other respondents. At lower levels of aggregation&#8212;for example  state to state compared to basin to state&#8212;it is usually necessary to withhold  more rates to assure data confidentiality. Therefore, because of the relatively high number of shipments included  in each origin-destination pair of EIA-923 data, more EIA rates than STB rates  normally can be published. This can be  seen in a comparison of Tables 23 and 27, for example.</p>
<p>  Even though there usually are fewer observations in  the STB data set than in the EIA-923 data set for each origin-destination  combination, there is a high degree of similarity between STB and EIA-923  average rates. At a national level, EIA-923  average rates are within about 2 percent of STB average rates in the two  years&#8212;2008 and 2009&#8212;when they can be compared (see percent difference reported  in Table 1). Differences are expected to  be larger at the basin to state and state to state levels according to how the  STB sampling procedure over- or under-samples various segments of the waybill  population. Also, because EIA-923 data  are not always a full census, biases can be introduced. Nevertheless, differences are modest for the  most part (see percent differences reported in Tables 3 through 8 and Tables 19  through 22). It is also worth noting  that, overall, there are about the same number of positive and negative  differences between STB and EIA rates, indicating that there is no systematic  bias in the differences, or, approximately, that the expected values of the  differences between the STB and EIA average rates are zero. EIA plans to continue analysis of differences  between these rates.</p>
<p>The EIA-923 survey collects data for all  transport modes including railroad, barge, truck, Great Lake colliers,  coal-slurry pipeline, tramways, and conveyor belt. Data confidentiality rules preclude the  publication of EIA-923 rates for coal-slurry pipeline, tramway, and conveyor  belt below the national level. In this  report, EIA is providing average rate estimates for truck and barge at the  national level (Table 2) and at the state to state level (Tables 15-18). Truck and barge transportation occurs mainly  in states east of the Mississippi River. Consequently, truck and barge rates by basin to state do not add much  additional information and were not calculated by EIA.</p>
<p>EIA calculated the $1 per ton adder for  subbituminous coal compared to bituminous coal based on studies by the National  Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), which has provided data on cost  differentials between power plants burning different coal types. Subbituminous power plants have an  approximate factor of 1.4 versus a bituminous plant on equipment volumes to  account for the requirements of handling larger volumes of coal to obtain the  corresponding heat content. For example,  larger capacity is needed for boilers, ducts, pollution control equipment,  waste steam pipes and coal handling equipment and stockpiles. The factor 1.4 is the ratio of bituminous  coal heat content (12,300 Btu/lb.) to subbituminous coal heat content (8,800  Btu/lb.). NETL optimizes the combination  and size of equipment and arrives at a cost addition ranging from $0.60 to  $1.20 per million Btu in 2010 dollars. EIA assessed a value of $1 per million Btu in this report in the market  area section assessing PRB and CAPP market area competitiveness.</p>
<p>This $1 adder was only included in the <em>Coal to <strike>gas</strike> <em>coal</em> switching: A look at  competing coal basins</em> section and is not included in any of the data tables  or other parts of this report. EIA  acknowledges that this analytic technique does not take into account factors  specific to individual plants or other contractual or special considerations  which are important in determining actual coal purchasing economics and  choices. Rather, this analysis is  intended to provide on-average cost information and demonstrate the significant  shifts in regional coal market dynamics over the period. </p>
