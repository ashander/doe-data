        <p>Between year-end 2014 and year-end 2015, U.S.  crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves decreased from 39.9 billion barrels  to 35.2 billion barrels&#8212;a decrease of 4.7 billion barrels (11.8%). Over the  same period, proved reserves of U.S. total natural gas<a href="../crudeoilnaturalgasreserves.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a>decreased by 64.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) (16.6%),  declining from 388.8 Tcf in 2014 to 324.3 Tcf. The average West Texas  Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot prices declined almost 50% (from $95 per  barrel in 2014 to $50 per barrel in 2015), and the average spot price of  natural gas at the Louisiana Henry Hub declined more than 40% from $4.55 per  million Btu in 2014 to $2.62 per million Btu in 2015. The significant reduction  in prices, which resulted in a more challenging characterization of existing  economic and operating conditions that are considered in the definition of  proved reserves, led to downward revisions across a broad range of U.S.  producers.</p>
<h3>Oil highlights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The average price  of oil in 2015 dropped 47% compared to 2014, causing operators to postpone or  cancel development plans and revise their proved reserves of crude oil and  lease condensate downward. As a result, U.S. proved reserves declined by 11.8% (4.7  billion barrels) in 2015.</li>
          <li>U.S. production  of crude oil and lease condensate increased in 2015 for the seventh consecutive  year, increasing by 7% from 2014.</li>
          <li>Crude oil and  lease condensate extensions were highest in Texas and North Dakota in 2015. However,  as a result of downward revisions, both states experienced a net reduction in  proved reserves.</li>
        <li>  New Mexico experienced the largest net increase  in proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate of all states in 2015,  mostly from development of the Wolfcamp shale and Bone Spring plays in  southeastern New Mexico&rsquo;s portion of the Delaware Basin.</li> </ul>
        <h3>Natural gas highlights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The average price of natural gas in 2015 dropped  42% compared to 2014, causing operators to revise their reserves downward, just  as they did with oil reserves. U.S. proved natural gas reserves declined 16.6%  (64.5 Tcf) in 2015.</li>
          <li>In 2015, Ohio added more than 5 Tcf of natural  gas proved reserves (in the Utica Shale play), and surpassed Arkansas and the  Gulf of Mexico to become the ninth-largest natural gas reserves state.</li>
          <li>U.S. production of total natural gas increased  for the tenth consecutive year, increasing by 4% from 2014.</li>      
          </ul>
        <div class="tie_correction">
        <h4>How can production go up when proved reserves are going down?</h4>
    <p>Generally,  when oil or natural gas prices fall or operating costs rise, the life of a  producing well may be shortened by reducing the remaining proved reserves that  are economically recoverable, and may cancel or postpone planned offset wells.  This may reduce the estimate of proved reserves, even if production is  increasing (usually because of a large number of new wells drilled and  completed prior to the price drop/cost increase). Changes in annual production  can therefore lag behind the year in which changes in proved reserves are  reported. A drilled and completed well is usually required to have proved  reserves. However, proved reserves can be assigned to a planned well, based on  surrounding wells and the geological and engineering data of these wells (if  the planned well will be drilled within five years). It's important to remember  that production cannot increase or maintain a certain level for very long  without continued development or enhanced oil recovery methods. Production will  inevitably decline in their absence.</p></div>
    
        <p><em>Proved reserves</em> are estimated volumes of hydrocarbon resources  that analysis of geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable  certainty<a href="../crudeoilnaturalgasreserves.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> are recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions.</p>
        <p>Reserves estimates change from year to year as new  discoveries are made, as existing fields are more thoroughly appraised, as  existing reserves are produced, and as prices and technologies evolve.</p>
<p>Sustained low prices for oil and natural gas continued  through most of 2016, and downward reserves revisions are likely in EIA's next  report for year-end 2016, but probably not to the same degree as in 2015. Lower  prices have curtailed drilling and made the economics more challenging in 2016.  Although technically recoverable resource estimates are not necessarily reduced  by lower prices, the calculation of proved reserves is sensitive to price  changes.</p>
        <h3>National summary</h3>
        <p>In 2015, U.S. crude oil and lease condensate  proved reserves decreased 4.7 billion barrels (11.8%) to 35.2 billion barrels (Table  1). Crude oil and lease condensate reserves last declined in 2008 (Figure 1). Proved  reserves of U.S. total natural gas decreased 64.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) to  324.3 Tcf in 2015 (Table 1). For both fuels, the net downward revisions to  reserves exceeded both the total discoveries and the estimated production for  2015.</p>

<p>Proved reserves of crude oil and lease  condensate decreased in each of the top five U.S. oil reserves states in 2015  (Figure 2). In 2015, Texas had the  largest proved reserves of any state but also the largest decline&#8212;a net  decrease of 1 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves  from 2014 to 2015. Although significant reserves additions (in the form of  field extensions) were made in the Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford shale plays, these additions  were countered by net downward revisions within the Lone Star State. North  Dakota, dominated by the Bakken shale play within the Williston Basin, had the  second-largest proved reserves, and similarly, the second largest decline in  2015, a net decrease of 838 million barrels of crude oil and lease condensate  proved reserves.</p>

<p>Proved natural gas reserves decreased in each of  the top five U.S. gas reserves states in 2015 (Figure 3). Texas was the largest  natural gas reserves state, and it had the largest net decrease (-20.6 Tcf) in  2015. Pennsylvania and Oklahoma (the second and third largest natural gas  proved reserves states, respectively) had large net downward revisions, but the  declines were partially offset by developments in the Marcellus and Woodford  shale plays. These offsets reduced the decline in these states to just 3.9 and  3.6 Tcf in 2015.</p>

       <h3>Background</h3>
<p>This report provides estimates of  U.S. proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate and proved reserves of natural  gas at year-end 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) starts  with the data filed on Form EIA-23L, Annual Report of Domestic Oil and Gas  Reserves, which was submitted by 450 of 467 sampled operators of U.S. oil and natural  gas fields. EIA then estimates proved reserves for the U.S., states, and state  subdivisions.</p>
<p>  Proved reserves are estimated  volumes of hydrocarbon resources that analysis of geologic and engineering data  demonstrates with reasonable certainty are recoverable under existing economic  and operating conditions. Reserves estimates change from year to year as new  discoveries are made, as existing fields are more thoroughly appraised, as existing  reserves are produced, and as prices and technologies change.</p>
<p>  Discoveries include new fields,  identification of new reservoirs in previously discovered fields, and  extensions, which are additions to reserves that result from additional  drilling and exploration in previously discovered reservoirs. In a given year,  extensions are typically the largest percentage of total discoveries. Although  discoveries of new fields and reservoirs are important indicators of new  resources, they generally account for a small percentage of overall annual  reserve additions.</p>
<p>Revisions primarily occur when operators change  their estimates of what they will be able to produce from the properties they  operate in response to changing prices or improvements in technology. Higher fuel  prices typically increase estimates (positive revisions) as operators consider  a broader portion of the resource base economically producible, or proved.  Lower prices, on the other hand, generally reduce estimates (negative  revisions) as the economically producible base diminishes.</p>
<p>The 2015 reporting period  represents the seventh year companies reporting to the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) followed revised rules for determining the prices  underpinning their proved reserves estimates. Designed to make estimates less  sensitive to price fluctuations during the year, the SEC rules require  companies to use an average of the 12 first-day-of-the-month prices.</p>
<p>Because actual prices received by operators  depend on their contractual arrangements, location, hydrocarbon quality, and  other factors, spot market prices are not necessarily the prices used by  operators in their reserve estimates for EIA. However, they do provide a  benchmark or trend indicator. The 12-month, first-day-of-the-month, average WTI  crude oil spot price for 2015 was $50 per barrel, a 47% decrease from 2014  (Figure 6).</p>

<p>The 12-month, first-day-of-the-month average  natural gas spot price at the Louisiana Henry Hub for 2015 was $2.62 per million  British thermal units (MMBtu), a 42% decrease from the previous year&rsquo;s average  spot price of $4.55 per MMBtu (Figure 7).</p>

<P><strong><em>Prices  in 2016</em>.</strong> At  the start of 2016, the <a href="../../dnav/pet/pet_pri_spt_s1_d.htm">spot price of WTI crude  oil</a> was at or near the lowest of the year.<a href="../crudeoilnaturalgasreserves.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> Throughout the rest of 2016, the price increased  incrementally but did not exceed $50 per barrel until June 7. The price declined  back below $40 per barrel on August 2, but increased back above $50 per barrel  in October.</p>
<P>Compared with the 12-month, first-of-the-month  2015 average of $50 per barrel, the 12-month, first-of-the-month 2016 average  WTI spot oil price decreased 15% to $42.60 per barrel. More net downward  revisions in U.S. crude oil proved reserves in 2016 may be possible, but probably  not to the same extent as was observed in this report for 2015.</p>
<P>  The 12-month, first-of-the-month average  natural gas spot price at the Henry Hub in Louisiana in 2015 was $2.62 per  MMBtu. In 2016, <a href="../../dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdd.htm">natural gas spot prices</a> remained below $3.00 per MMBtu until September&#8212;often well below. The average 12-month,  first-of-the-month spot natural gas price at the Henry Hub decreased 6% in 2016,  to $2.46 per MMBtu. As with oil, some net downward revisions in U.S. natural  gas proved reserves may be possible in the 2016 reserves report.</p>
<p>Throughout 2015 and continuing into 2016, the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/e_ertrr0_xr0_nus_cm.htm">number of U.S.  rotary rigs in operation</a> declined. Fewer new discoveries and extensions of  existing fields are anticipated for 2016, combined with possible net downward  revisions. These factors could negatively affect both crude oil and natural gas  reserves in 2016. U.S. production of crude oil and natural gas, which rose in  2015, may be negatively affected by reduced drilling in 2016.</p>
<h3>Crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves</h3>
<p>U.S. crude oil and lease condensate proved  reserves decreased for the first time in seven years in 2015 (Figure 8). The average  price of oil in 2015 dropped 47% compared to 2014, causing operators to  postpone or cancel development plans and revise their proved  reserves of crude oil and lease condensate downward. In the past 20 years,  declines in reserves were observed in 1995, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2004, 2006, and  2008.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/images/fig_8.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/images/fig_8.png" alt="Figure 8. U.S. crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves, 1985-2015" width="522" /></a><br />
        <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/excel/fig8_data.xlsx" class="ico_xls">figure data</a></span></span></p>
<p>U.S. crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves decreased  by 11.8% (4.7 billion barrels) in 2015, mostly attributable to negative net  revisions to the proved reserves of existing fields (Figure 9a).</p>
<p>  Proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate declined  the most in Texas in 2015. Although Texas had the most total discoveries of crude  oil and lease condensate proved reserves in 2015 (almost 1.4 billion barrels),  this volume was canceled by over 1.7 billion barrels of net downward revisions.  After the net of acquisitions, sales and adjustments were added in, and the  state&rsquo;s annual production (over 1.2 billion barrels) was taken out, Texas crude  oil and lease condensate proved reserves declined by 7% (1,001 million barrels)  in 2015.</p>
<p>North Dakota had the second-largest net decrease  in crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves in 2015. Total discoveries added  0.6 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves, but net  downward revisions reduced the state total by 1 billion barrels. At year-end  2015 (after state production of 0.4 billion barrels), North Dakota crude oil  and lease condensate proved reserves decreased 14% (838 million barrels).</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/images/fig_9a.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/images/fig_9a.png" alt="Figure 9a. U.S. crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves changes, 2014-15" width="522" /></a></span><span><br />
    </p>
<p>A sustained low price environment in 2015 caused  the large volume of negative net revisions and also reduced the annual volume  of extensions to existing fields (Figure 9b).</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/images/fig_9b.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/images/fig_9b.png" alt="Figure 9b. Components of U.S. crude oil and lease condensate reserves changes, 2005-15" width="522" /></a><br />

<p>A producing area of the United States that actually  added proved reserves in 2015 was the Permian Basin of west Texas and eastern  New Mexico. Although the state total declined in Texas in 2015, one state  subdivision&#8212;Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) District 8&#8212;added a net 681 million  barrels of proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate in 2015, mostly  from extensions to existing Permian Basin fields. Across the border in eastern  New Mexico, development of the Wolfcamp shale (and other stacked producing  formations such as the Bone Spring carbonate, the Strawn sandstone, and the Avalon  shale) added 31 million barrels of proved reserves.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2015, <em>tight plays</em><a href="../crudeoilnaturalgasreserves.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> accounted for 33% of all U.S. crude oil and  lease condensate proved reserves. Most of  these proved reserves (93%) came from six tight oil plays (Table 2). The Bakken/Three  Forks play in the Williston Basin remained the largest oil-producing tight play  in the United States in 2015. EIA has a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/maps/maps.htm">series of maps and animations</a> showing  the nation's shale and other tight play (providing oil and natural gas) resources.</p>

<P><strong><em>Total discoveries.</em></strong> Total discoveries added 3.2 billion barrels  to U.S. crude oil and lease condensate reserves in 2015. Total discoveries  consist of discoveries of new fields, identification of new reservoirs in  fields discovered in prior years, and extensions (reserve additions that result  from the additional drilling and exploration in previously discovered  reservoirs).</p>
<P>  Geographically, the largest total  discoveries of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves in 2015 were in Texas,  North Dakota, and Oklahoma. Texas had total discoveries of 1.4 billion barrels,  North Dakota had 0.6 billion barrels, and Oklahoma had 0.4 billion barrels in  2015. Total discoveries in the federal Gulf of Mexico were 108 million barrels,  20 million barrels of which came from new field discoveries. In 2015, all U.S. new  field discoveries were in the federal Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<P><strong><em>Net revisions and other changes.</em></strong> Revisions to reserves occur primarily when  operators change their estimates of what they are able to economically produce  from the properties they operate using existing technology and current economic  conditions. Thus, current prices are critical in estimating economically  producible reserves. Other changes occur when operators buy and sell properties  (revaluing the proved reserves in the process), and as various adjustments are  made to reconcile estimated volumes.</p>
<P>  Net downward revisions decreased  U.S. crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves by 5.6 billion barrels in  2015. Geographically, the largest net downward revisions of crude oil and lease  condensate proved reserves were in Texas, North Dakota, and Alaska. Texas  revised reserves downward by 1.7 billion barrels, North Dakota by 995 million  barrels, and Alaska by 691 million barrels.</p>
<p>The net change to U.S. crude oil and lease  condensate proved reserves associated with buying and selling properties was a  drop of 30 million barrels in 2015. Adjustments (positive and negative reserves  changes that EIA cannot attribute to any other category) increased U.S. proved oil  reserves by 1.1 billion barrels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Production.</em></strong> The United  States produced an estimated 3.4 billion barrels<a href="../crudeoilnaturalgasreserves.html#5"> <sup>5</sup></a> of  crude oil and lease condensate in 2015, an increase of 7% from 2014. This level  represents the country's seventh consecutive annual production increase.  Production from the Lower 48 states was 8% above the 2014 level. Alaska  experienced a 4% production decline. </p>
<h3>Natural gas proved reserves</h3>
<p>U.S. proved reserves of total natural gas (including  natural gas plant liquids) decreased by 16.6% (64.5 Tcf) in 2015 (Figure 10). The  average price of U.S. natural gas in 2015 dropped 42% compared to 2014, resulting  in operators revising their 2015 natural gas proved reserves downward, just as  they did with oil reserves (Figure 11a). At  the state level, Texas and West Virginia reported the largest net decreases in  natural gas proved reserves in 2015. Texas natural gas proved reserves declined by 20.6 Tcf, and West  Virginia natural gas proved reserves declined by 9.3 Tcf. In contrast to these  large decreases, Ohio added more than 5 Tcf of natural gas proved reserves in  2015, resulting from development of the Utica/Pt. Pleasant shale play in  eastern Ohio. Ohio surpassed Arkansas and the federal Gulf of Mexico to become  the state with the ninth-largest volume of natural gas proved reserves.</p>

<p>At the state level, total  discoveries of natural gas reserves were highest in Pennsylvania and Texas, at 10.2  Tcf and 6.8 Tcf, respectively. However, both Pennsylvania and Texas reported overall net declines in their 2015 natural gas  proved reserves, because discoveries were more than offset by negative net  revisions. Ohio had the third-largest volume of total discoveries in 2015 (5.0  Tcf).</p>
<p>Total discoveries in Pennsylvania were from  extensions in the Marcellus shale play, the largest natural gas shale play in  the United States by reserves volume. Total discoveries in Texas were mostly  from extensions to fields in the Permian Basin (TX RRC District 8), Eagle Ford  shale play (TX RRC Districts 2 and 4), and the Barnett shale play (TX RRC District  5).</p>

<p><strong><em>Net revisions and other changes</em>.</strong> Net revisions decreased U.S. total natural  gas proved reserves by 80 Tcf in 2015. The following states had the largest changes  (positive and negative) in 2015 because of net revisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Texas had the largest negative net revision of  natural gas proved reserves of all states in 2015, a decrease of 22 Tcf. Within  Texas, RRC District 5 (Barnett shale play) had the largest negative net  revisions of all Districts at 6.2 Tcf.</li>
  <li>West Virginia had the second-largest negative net  revision of natural gas proved reserves at 13.5 Tcf.</li>
  <li>Pennsylvania had the third-largest negative net revision  of natural gas proved reserves at 12.5 Tcf, but this was mostly offset by 10.2  Tcf of extensions in the Marcellus shale play.</li>
  <li>Ohio was one of the few states in 2015 that had  a positive net revision to its natural gas proved reserves. Ohio&rsquo;s reserves  were revised upward by 0.8 Tcf in addition to 5.0 Tcf of total discoveries in  2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>The net change to natural gas proved reserves  from the purchase and sale of properties resulted in an additional U.S. gain of  1.4 Tcf in 2015. The largest net acquisition of natural gas proved reserves in  2015 was in western New Mexico&#8212;where an operator that acquired properties in  the San Juan Basin expects better results than the previous owner. Adjustments  (annual reserves changes that EIA cannot attribute to any other category) to U.S.  total natural gas proved reserves totaled 9.4 Tcf.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Production</em></strong>. <strong><em>Production</em></strong>.

Both of these estimates are record-high levels for the United States, and this is  the tenth consecutive year that U.S. natural gas production (the estimate  published in this report) has increased.</p>
        <p>On a geographic basis, Pennsylvania had the  largest increase in natural gas production by volume, a gain of 0.6 Tcf (13%). Ohio  had the second-largest increase, 0.5 Tcf, which almost doubled that state&rsquo;s production  compared to 2014. The state with the largest estimated decline in natural gas  production in 2015 was Louisiana (a drop of 0.15 Tcf, or 8%).</p>
        <h4>Nonassociated natural gas</h4>
        <p>Nonassociated natural gas, also called gas well gas, is defined  as natural gas not in contact with significant quantities of crude oil in a  reservoir. EIA considers most shale natural gas and all coalbed natural gas to  be nonassociated natural gas proved reserves. Proved reserves of U.S.  nonassociated natural gas decreased by 60.9 Tcf in 2015, a 19% decrease from  2014 (Table 11). Estimated production of U.S. nonassociated natural gas  increased 1%&#8212;from 22.8 Tcf in 2014 to 23.1 Tcf in 2015. The largest increase in  nonassociated natural gas production was in Pennsylvania (Marcellus Shale)&#8212;where  annual nonassociated natural gas production increased from 4.2 Tcf in 2014 to  4.8 Tcf in 2015.</p>
        <h4>Associated-dissolved natural gas</h4>
        <p> Associated-dissolved natural gas, also called casinghead gas, is defined as the  combined volume of natural gas that occurs in crude oil reservoirs either as  free gas (associated) or as gas in solution with crude oil (dissolved). Proved  reserves of associated-dissolved natural gas decreased from 69.1 Tcf in 2014 to  65.5 Tcf in 2015&#8212;a decrease of 5% (3.6 Tcf) (Table 12). Estimated production of  associated-dissolved natural gas increased 17%&#8212;from 5.3 Tcf in 2014 to 6.2 Tcf  in 2015. The largest increase in associated-dissolved natural gas production in  2015 was in Texas, specifically in Texas RRC Districts 1, 2, and 8, coinciding  with the gains in oil production from the Eagle Ford Shale play and from the  Permian Basin. </p>
        <h4>Coalbed natural gas        </h4>
        <p> Coalbed natural gas, also called coalbed methane, is a type of natural gas  contained in and removed from coal seams. Extraction requires drilling wells  into the coal seams and removing water contained in the seams to reduce  hydrostatic pressure and to release adsorbed (and free) natural gas from the  coal. Proved reserves of U.S. coalbed natural gas decreased from 15.7 Tcf in  2014 to 12.5 Tcf in 2015, a 20% drop (Tables 15 and 16). Estimated production  of coalbed natural gas decreased 10%&#8212;from 1.40 Tcf in 2014 to 1.27 Tcf in 2015.  Among individual states, New Mexico experienced the largest decrease (0.9 Tcf)  in proved reserves of coalbed methane, followed by Wyoming and Colorado (declining  by 0.8 Tcf and 0.7 Tcf, respectively). No states reported an increase in  coalbed methane proved reserves in 2015.</p>
        <h4>Natural gas from shale</h4>
        <p>Shale formations can be both the  source rock and the production zone. Tight shale formations must typically be  hydraulically fractured to produce natural gas at economic rates. Horizontally-drilled  wells perform substantially better than conventional vertical wells (but are  more expensive to drill and complete at the same depth). Proved reserves of  U.S. natural gas from shale decreased from 199.7 Tcf in 2014 to 175.6 Tcf in  2015.</p>
        <p>The share of natural gas from shale compared  with total U.S. natural gas proved reserves increased from 51% in 2014 to 54%  in 2015 (Figure 12). Estimated production of natural gas from shale increased 13%&#8211;from  13.4 Tcf in 2014 to 15.2 Tcf in 2015.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Pennsylvania had the highest level of natural gas  proved reserves from shale in 2015 (53.5 Tcf), and Texas had the second highest  level (42.6 Tcf) (Figure 13). West Virginia (19.2 Tcf) remained the third largest.  
Oklahoma (18.6 Tcf) was the fourth-largest shale gas proved reserves state. Ohio  became the fifth-largest shale gas proved reserves state in 2015 (Utica/Pt.  Pleasant Shale proved reserves rose to 12.4 Tcf), and Louisiana and Arkansas were  the sixth- and seventh-largest, respectively.</p>

        <p>Seven shale plays contained 91% of U.S. shale  gas proved reserves at the end of 2015 (Table 4). The Marcellus Shale play remained  the play with the largest amount of natural gas proved reserves from shale, even  though its total declined the most (11.8 Tcf, a 14% decline in proved reserves)  in 2015. The second-largest shale gas play was the Eagle Ford, where proved  reserves declined 17% in 2015.</p>

  <p>The proved reserves of shale gas in  the Barnett Shale play decreased by 7.3 Tcf in 2015; it remains the oldest and fourth-largest  shale gas play in the United States. EIA has a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/maps/maps.htm">series of maps</a> showing the  nation&rsquo;s shale gas resources for both shale plays and geologic basin<em>s</em>. </p>
  <h4>Dry natural gas</h4>
  <p>Dry natural gas is the volume of natural  gas (primarily methane) that remains after natural gas liquids and  non-hydrocarbon impurities are removed from the natural gas stream, usually downstream  at a natural gas processing plant. Not all produced gas has to be processed at  a natural gas processing plant. Some produced gas is dry without processing. </p>
<p>In 2015, the estimated dry natural gas content  of U.S. total natural gas proved reserves decreased from 368.7 Tcf in 2014 to 307.7  Tcf, a 16% drop (Table 17).</p>
<h3>Lease condensate and natural gas plant liquids</h3>
    <p>Operators of natural gas fields report lease  condensate reserves and production estimates to EIA on Form EIA-23L, <em>Annual Report of Domestic Oil and Gas  Reserves</em>. EIA calculates the  expected yield of natural gas plant liquids using estimates of total natural  gas reserves and a recovery factor determined for each area of origin. Data  from Form EIA-64A, <em>Annual Report of the  Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production</em>, are the basis of EIA's recovery  factors.</p>

<h4>Lease condensate</h4>
<p>Lease condensate is a mixture  consisting primarily of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes that is recovered as  a liquid from natural gas in lease separation facilities. This category  excludes natural gas plant liquids, such as butane and propane, which are  recovered at downstream natural gas processing plants or facilities. Lease  condensate usually enters the crude oil stream.</p>
<p>U.S. lease condensate proved reserves had increased  for six consecutive years, but the downward revision of proved natural gas  reserves in 2015 resulted in an equivalent downward revision in lease  condensate proved reserves. U.S. proved reserves of lease condensate declined  from 3,548 million barrels in 2014 to 2,912 million barrels in 2015, a drop of 18%.  U.S. lease condensate production decreased 1%, from 326 million barrels in 2014  to 323 million barrels in 2015.</p>
<h4>Natural gas plant liquids</h4>
<p>Natural gas plant liquids (unlike  lease condensate) remain within the natural gas after passing through lease  separation equipment. These liquids are normally separated from the natural gas  at processing plants, fractionators, and cycling plants. Natural gas plant  liquids extracted include ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and natural  gasoline. Components may be further fractionated or mixed. Lease condensate is  not a natural gas plant liquid and is not a component of the natural gas plant  liquids total.</p>
<p>As with dry natural gas, the potential U.S.  supply of natural gas plant liquids is not categorized as proved reserves, because  these liquids are extracted downstream of the producing wells at a natural gas  processing plant. An estimated volume of these liquids that might be extracted  from total natural gas reserves is shown in Table 17. The estimated volume of  natural gas plant liquids contained in proved reserves of total natural gas decreased  from 15.0 billion barrels in 2014 to 12.7 billion barrels in 2015 (a 15% decline).</p>
<h3>Reserves in nonproducing reservoirs</h3>
<p>Not all proved reserves are  contained in actively producing reservoirs. Examples of proved reserves in  nonproducing reservoirs include existing producing wells that are shut in  awaiting well workovers; drilled wells that await completion by hydraulic  fracturing; sites that require installation of production equipment or pipeline  facilities; or behind-the-pipe reserves that require the depletion of other  zones or reservoirs before they can be placed on production (by recompleting  the well).</p>
<p>Table 18 shows the estimated volumes of  nonproducing proved reserves of crude oil, lease condensate, nonassociated  natural gas, associated-dissolved natural gas, and total natural gas for 2015.</p>
