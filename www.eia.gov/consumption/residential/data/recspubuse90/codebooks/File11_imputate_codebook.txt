       A SCALE FACTOR IS RPRTD FOR THE VARS HTED,  
       UNHEATED, & HOMEAREA WHEN THE  MEASURE-  
       MENTS OR ESTIMS.WERE BASED ON INSD DIMEN-  
       SIONS.  THE SCALE FACTOR HAS AN IMPLIED  
       DECIMAL POINT BEFORE THE FIRST DIGIT,  
       AND MUST BE ADDED TO 1.000 TO PRODUCE  
       THE ACTUAL SCALE FACTOR:  E.G., SCALE =  
       149 REPRESENTS A SCALE FACTOR OF 1.149.   
       WHEN THE VARIABLES HEATED, UNHEATED, AND  
       HOMEAREA ARE NOT BASED ON INSIDE MEASURE-  
       MENTS, SCALE IS SET AT 999.  ALSO, SCALE = 999  
       WHENEVER THE VARIABLES HEATED, UNHEATED AND  
       HOMEAREA WERE ALL IMPUTED.
