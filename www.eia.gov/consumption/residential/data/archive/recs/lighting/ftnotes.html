the average length of use is 6.7 hours. <BR>

There is some uncertainty about this point. The lighting industry
states that compact fluorescent bulbs need only one-fourth the
wattage of incandescent bulbs. EIA compared the savings of both
26-watt, 22-dollar compact fluorescent bulbs and 20-watt, 20-dollar
compact fluorescent bulbs. There is very little difference in
overall savings between these two types of bulbs. The biggest
difference in savings is between the compact fluorescent and incandescent.
Estimates of potential savings in this report are based on a 22-dollar,
26-watt compact fluorescent.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="f4"><FONT SIZE=2>4. From these two estimates, one cannot
conclude that 3.5 lights are used between 15 minutes and one hour
per day because the estimates of lights used 15 minutes or more
are from the Lighting Supplement Questionnaire, while the estimates
of lights used one hour or more are from the RECS Household Questionnaire
(see Chapter One for more details about these questionnaires).
</FONT></A><BR>
<P>
<A NAME="f5"><FONT SIZE=2>5. Light-hours are the total number
of hours that all lights in the household are used. For example,
if a household has 7 lights, and they are all used, on average,
2 hours a day, then there are 14 light-hours per day in that household.

total sales of 2,861 billion kWh. For total kWh sales of electricity
for 1993, see Table 1, <I>Electric Sales and Revenue 1993</I>,

<A NAME="f15"><FONT SIZE=2>15. Because electricity generation
requires the use of other fuels as input, the energy required
to generate this 31.7 billion kWh is about 326 trillion Btu (see

Review</I>, DOE/EIA-0035(96/08). (Washington, DC, August 1996),

is a function of the independent variables.<BR>

<A NAME="f18"><FONT SIZE=2>18. In previous RECS (prior to 1987),
the electricity used to run fans for central forced-air heating
systems was assigned to the space-heating components. This was
changed in the 1987 and subsequent RECS so that the households
that did not use electricity as a space-heating energy source
(either main or secondary), by definition, did not have positive
amounts of electricity assigned to the space-heating component.
<BR>
</FONT></A>
<P>
<A NAME="f19"><FONT SIZE=2>19. Previous RECS (prior to 1987) included
a term for evaporative coolers, whole-house fans, ceiling fans,
and window fans in the air-conditioning component of the electricity
equation. Therefore, the consumption of electricity to operate
these types of coolers and fans was assigned to the air-conditioning
component. Consequently, some households that did not have air-conditioning
equipment, had positive consumption assigned to their air-conditioning
component.<BR>
