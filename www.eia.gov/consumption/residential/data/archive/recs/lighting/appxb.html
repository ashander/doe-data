</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Two approaches for estimating the kilowatthours used
for lighting that are based upon data from the 1993 RECS were
used in this report. The first approach used only bulb type and
hours of usage data from the RECS Lighting Supplement. The second
approach is a regression-based approach that uses the full RECS
dataset. This appendix will provide more details concerning both
of these methods.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The main purpose of the Lighting Supplement, which
collected data from a subsample of the 1993 RECS respondents,
was to develop a model of kilowatthours used for lighting as a
function of variables obtained on the full RECS Household Questionnaire.
The resulting model was used to create an index of lighting usage.
This index was then used as a predictor variable in a regression
analysis. The results of the regression analysis were used to
disaggregate the total electricity usage into consumption by end
use. One of these end uses is lighting. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The RECS Lighting Supplement (Form EIA-457H) is a
short questionnaire completed by 474 of the 7,111 households that
responded to the RECS Household Questionnaire (Form EIA-457A).
The Lighting Supplement was not administered to all of the 1993
RECS respondents because of cost and respondent burden constraints.
The Lighting Supplement provides detailed information on indoor
lights used 15 minutes or more (up to a maximum of 15 lights)
by type of bulb, hours used, and the room in which the light is
located. If the respondents reported that there were more than
15 lights that met the criteria covered by the Lighting Supplement,
only the number of additional bulbs was recorded.<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lights in the Lighting Supplement database were assigned
a wattage amount based upon the bulb type reported. Similarly,
the hours used for a light were inferred from the respondent's
estimate of the number of hours the light was used. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Kilowatthours = (Wattage * Hours Used)/1000 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The kilowatthours for each light equals the wattage
times the hours, divided by 1,000. The kilowatthours for each
respondent to the Lighting Supplement equal the sum of the estimated
kilowatthours for all the lights for that respondent.<BR>

<I><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Wattage for Incandescent Lights
<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Incandescent lights in the Lighting Supplement database
were assigned a wattage based upon the respondents' estimates
of their wattage. Lighting fixtures with more than one bulb were
counted as one light. The wattage for these fixtures was the total
wattage of all bulbs in the fixture. The respondents were asked
to categorize incandescent lights by their total wattage. Lights
with total wattage less than 10 (night lights) were excluded from
the Lighting Supplement. Incandescent lights with a total between
10 and 40 were coded as &quot;low&quot; incandescent. Those with
wattage between 41 and 149 were coded as &quot;medium&quot; incandescent
and those with 150 or more were coded as &quot;high&quot; incandescent.
It is assumed that some of the lights coded as &quot;medium&quot;
incandescent are actually fixtures with multiple bulbs. The same
applies to &quot;high&quot; incandescent. Incandescent lights
coded as &quot;low&quot; were assigned a wattage of 30, &quot;medium&quot;
were assigned a wattage of 100, and &quot;high&quot; were assigned
a wattage of 200. Incandescent lights for which the respondent
did not provide a wattage estimate were assigned a wattage of
60.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The regression analysis of the Lighting Supplement
data was done in two steps. In both steps, a stepwise linear regression
program was used and the dependent variable was the kilowatthour
estimate for lighting obtained from the bulb type and hours data
described above. In addition, both steps used the same set of
independent variables. In the first step, all of the observations
received the same weight. In the second step, the Lighting Supplement
observations were given a weight equal to the inverse of the predicted
kilowatthours obtained from the first step. This weighting was
used to adjust for the higher variance of the error term for households
that were projected to use more electricity for lighting.<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For each household that responded to the 1993 RECS,
the annual amount of electricity used for five end&#173;use categories--
space heating, water heating, air-conditioning, refrigerators,
and general appliance usage--was estimated. The end&#173;use amounts
were not based on data produced by placing meters on individual
appliances; rather, they were obtained by estimating how much
of the total annual consumption for electricity can be attributed
to each of the end&#173;use categories for each household by using
a regression technique. The data from the Lighting Supplement
allowed us to estimate lighting as a subcomponent of the appliance
end-use estimates for the first time in the RECS history.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The annual consumption attributed to each of the
end&#173;use categories can be estimated by use of regression
equations. The regression equations are also used to impute electricity
consumption when the billing data are missing or inadequate. The
dependent variable was the annual electricity consumption for
the 1993 calendar year. The desire to use a large number of independent
variables without using a large number of interaction terms and
the desire to adapt the regression procedures to account for heteroscedastic<A
HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f17">[17]</A>
error terms led to the use of a nonlinear regression technique.
The use of linear regression would have greatly restricted the
ability to adequately model household energy consumption.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This section of the appendix provides an overview
of the methodology used for the 1993 RECS end-use estimation.
The specific regression equations used are not presented here.
(For more detailed information, please contact the person cited
as the end-use estimation contact on the Contacts page at the
beginning of this report.) The procedure used for the 1993 RECS
is very similar to that used in the 1990 RECS. Detailed equations
for the 1990 RECS were published in Appendix D, &quot;End-Use
Estimation Methodology,&quot; of <I>Household Energy Consumption
and Expenditures 1990</I> (Energy Information Administration,
February 1993, DOE/EIA-0321(90)). <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The space&#173;heating component was defined as all
electricity used to generate heat by space&#173;heating equipment.
The equipment could be the main space&#173;heating equipment or
secondary space&#173;heating equipment. Hence, a household could
have had a positive amount of electricity assigned to the space&#173;heating
component even if the electricity source was not used as the main
space&#173;heating energy source.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the electricity equation in the 1987 and subsequent
RECS, the electricity associated with the operation of fans in
any central forced-air heating equipment was assigned to the electricity
appliance component and not to the space-heating component. <A

electricity used to heat water for hot running water, as well
as water heated at point sources (such as stoves or auxiliary
water&#173;heating equipment) for bathing, cleaning and other
noncooking applications of hot water. Electricity used at point
sources to heat water for cooking and hot drinks was considered
part of the general appliance component, as was electricity used

defined as all electricity associated with (1) electric air&#173;conditioning
equipment and (2) fans in any central air&#173;conditioning equipment
including natural gas air&#173;conditioning equipment. The regression
equations for electricity do not contain specific terms for whole-house
fans, window fans, and evaporative (swamp) coolers, because the
terms were only marginally significant. Hence, the consumption
of electricity to operate these fans and evaporative coolers was
not assigned to the air-conditioning component; it was included
in the appliance component. The term for ceiling fans is in the
electricity appliance component. <A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f19">[19]</A></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>In the 1993 RECS, the households that reported that
they had air&#173;conditioning equipment but did not use the equipment,
were assigned a value of zero for their electricity air&#173;conditioning

<FONT SIZE=2>The actual annual consumption is called Y. The unit
of measure for Y and YCOM is thousands of Btu. The typical regression
error term is as follows:<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>e<SUB>1</SUB> = Y &#173; YCOM .<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unfortunately, the variance of e<SUB>1</SUB> tends
to increase as YCOM increases. Furthermore, the distribution of
e<SUB>1</SUB> is skewed in the positive direction. These two facts
violate the assumptions associated with linear least&#173;squares
regression. On the other hand, the distribution of<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>is closer to being normally distributed with a constant
variance. Hence, a nonlinear least&#173;squares regression procedure
that minimizes the sum of squares of e<SUB>2</SUB> was used.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The dependent variable was the household's electricity
consumption as reported on the RECS Suppliers Survey in thousands
of Btu. Most of the independent variables are derived from information
reported by the individual households on the Household Survey.
The end-use components consisted of sums or products of terms
that themselves may have been sums or products of the independent
variables. The overall methodology may seem complex at first glance,
but there was a common structure. In general, the components consisted
of an overall term multiplied by various adjustments. This format
allowed the components to be adjusted by many factors. The relative
size of the adjustments was easy to determine.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The disadvantage of the format was that it yields
a basic equation that is intrinsically nonlinear. As a result,
standard multivariate linear regression techniques could not be
used to estimate the parameters. A nonlinear technique was used
instead. The parameters were estimated by using the nonlinear
regression procedure (PROC NLIN) contained in the statistical
computer package, SAS. <A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f21">[21]</A><BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The lighting component covers the consumption of
electricity for both indoor and outdoor lighting. The indoor lighting
is modeled by using the equation (converted to thousand Btu) developed
from the Lighting Supplement as an independent variable. Outdoor
lighting is modeled by using variables that describe the presence
and use of outdoor lights. As with all components, the lighting
component is multiplied times common adjustment terms. These terms
are functions of the price of electricity, presence of household
members during the day, family income, age of dwelling, housing
unit type, and demographic characteristics of the house holder.
