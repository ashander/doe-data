<FONT SIZE=2>This section contains a basic profile of lighting
use in residential households. It includes brief discussions about
the characteristics and location of lights used in residential
households, as well as descriptions of the amount of electricity
used for lighting and variations in households' consumption of
electricity for lighting.<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of light bulbs in residential households
are incandescent. According to the RECS Survey, 453 million lights
out of a total of 523 million used one or more hours per day are
incandescent (87 percent).<A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f8">[8]</A> The
Lighting Supplement also estimates that 87 percent of residential
lights used 15 minutes or more per day are incandescent. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Fluorescent Lights of All Types<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thirteen percent, or 69.5 million lights used one
or more hours per day are fluorescent. Fluorescent lights tend
to be used more hours per day than incandescent lights. Twenty-one
percent of the lights used more than 12 hours per day are fluorescent
lights (see Table 2.1).<A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f9">[9]</A><BR>

<I><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Compact Fluorescent Lights<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>According to the RECS Survey, compact fluorescent
lights are used in 8.9 percent of residential households, although
49 percent of the homes reported knowing about them. <A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f10">[10]</A>
The percentage of households using compact fluorescent lights
varies slightly by Census region, with households in the Northeast
being somewhat more likely to use them, presumably due to higher
electricity prices. The Lighting Supplement data show that less
than one percent of all lights used 15 minutes or more per day
are compact fluorescent. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Halogen Lights<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A halogen light is a type of incandescent light that
is slightly more efficient than the common incandescent light.
A 100-watt common incandescent produces 17.5 lumens per watt compared
with a 100-watt halogen, which produces 18.8 lumens per watt.
These differences are much smaller than the comparison with the
compact fluorescent, but the typical cost of a halogen light is
4 dollars versus 20-22 dollars for a compact fluorescent. Halogen
lights are more widely known than the compact fluorescent (66
percent of households have heard of them), but they are used in
only 12 percent of homes. Again, the RECS Survey shows this varies
by Census Region, with households in the Northeast and West being
somewhat more likely to use halogen lights.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">Location of Lights<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Rooms<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Incandescent lights predominate in all rooms in the
household, both in number and in hours used (Figure 2.1). In all
rooms, except for the kitchen and &quot;other&quot; (which includes
laundry rooms), incandescent lights account for at least 90 percent
of the hours used. Although the kitchen and &quot;other rooms&quot;
contain the most fluorescent lights, fluorescent lights in these
rooms still account for only 30 to 33 percent of the hours used.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Rooms that contain the most lights do not necessarily
consume the most electricity for lighting. For example, bedrooms
have the most lights, followed by the kitchen and the living room.
However, the lights in the kitchen are used the most hours, followed
by the living room and bedrooms (Figure ES5). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For lights used at least 15 minutes per day, the
average use per light in kitchens is about 3.8 hours, followed
by living rooms (3.4 hours per light), and family rooms (3.3 hours
per light). Rooms where lights are used less intensively are bedrooms
(1.6 hours per light) and bathrooms (1.8 hours per light). <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Outdoor Lights<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>About two-thirds of U.S. homes use outdoor lighting.
The percentage is much lower for apartments in buildings containing
5 or more units. In these structures, only 28 percent of the households
reported using an outdoor light. <A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f11">[11]</A>
The percentage using outdoor lights in other types of structures
is 76 percent for single-family homes, 69 percent for mobile homes,
and 59 percent for small apartment buildings (2 to 4 units).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In approximately half of the households that use
outdoor lights, the wattage of all outdoor lights combined for
each household is below 150 watts. We may assume it is over 150
watts for the other half. <A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f12">[12]</A> Lights
are turned on for the evening in 41 percent of the homes, while
other homes using outdoor lights leave them turned on all night
or have them controlled in some way. Only three percent of homes
use a high-intensity discharge light outdoors (see the Glossary
for definitions of different types of lights).<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Usage<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1993, the average household consumed 940.5 kWh
of electricity for lighting. Electricity consumption for lighting
increases with increasing income, number of household members,
and number of rooms in the housing unit (see Tables 4.9, 4.10,
and 4.11 of the Detailed Tables). Consumption also varies with
Census region. Households in the South and Midwest consume the
most electricity for lighting (Figure 2.2). Perhaps this is because
electricity costs less in those Census regions.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An alternative way of displaying electricity consumption
for lighting is to show the percent of households in consumption
categories. For example, Figure 2.3 shows a distribution of households,
for each household type, by the amount of electricity for lighting,
in 250 kWh increments. The largest number of apartments (32.9
percent) consume between 250 and 499 kWh. The largest number of
mobile homes (24.0 percent) consume between 500 and 749 kWh. Among
single-family homes, the consumption is higher, with 17.4 percent
using between 750 and 999 kWh.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Costs<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The RECS survey shows that the average annual cost
of electricity for lighting is approximately 83 dollars per household
(1993 dollars), which is about 10 percent of the average expenditures
on electricity in 1993 ($840). The 25th and 75th percentiles show
that 25 percent of the households paid less than 43 dollars and
25 percent paid more than 109 dollars. One-half paid between 43
dollars and 109 dollars. Although households in the South and
Midwest consumed more electricity for lighting, households in
the Northeast paid the most for electricity for lighting because
they had the highest average electricity prices (Figure 2.4).
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Variation in Lighting Consumption Among
Households<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The annual electricity consumption for lighting in
1993 was 940 kWh per household--9 percent of the total consumption.
This figure includes both indoor and outdoor lights. Figure 2.5
shows the cumulative percent of households by annual electricity
consumption for lighting. The median consumption for all households
is 818 kWh. Households in single-family homes use the most electricity
for lighting, while households in apartment buildings use the
least (median of 953 and 484 kWh, respectively).<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just as total energy use varies considerably from
one household to another, so does the percentage of electricity
used for lighting. This percentage varies because of the different
uses that are made of electricity. Some households use electricity
for some heavy work--heating the home, water heating, and air-conditioning,
so their bills will be large and the lighting component a small
part of the bill. Other households not using electricity for these
heavy loads will show a higher percentage of their electricity
used for lighting. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The variation in the percentage of electricity used
for lighting depends on the cost of electricity, what it is used
for, and the climate where the household is located. Unlike space
heating and water heating, where nonelectric energy sources are
chosen when the cost of electricity gets too high, alternative
sources for lighting are not much used today. Consequently, in
areas where the cost of electricity is high, one sees a small
decrease in the amount of electricity used for lighting (Table
2.2), although these smaller amounts represent a larger share
of the total electricity bill.<BR>

Uses<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lighting accounted for 9.4 percent of all electricity
consumption in U.S. households in 1993, less than air conditioning,
water heating, space heating, or refrigeration (Figure ES4). <A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f13">[13]</A>
Residential lighting thus represents three percent of total U.S.
sales of electricity to all sectors. <A HREF="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/archive/recs/lighting/ftnotes.html#f14">[14]</A>
Because the end-use estimates do not distinguish between indoor
and outdoor lighting, this estimate of lighting consumption includes
both.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Virtually 100 percent of households use electricity
for lighting, while less than 70 percent use it for air conditioning
and less than 40 percent use it for space heating and water heating.
However, because space conditioning and water heating are more
intensive users of electricity than lighting, they account for
a greater amount of the total electricity consumption in the residential
sector. In 1993, air conditioning consumed 13.9 percent, water
heating 10.2 percent and space heating 12.3 percent. Lighting
consumed 9.4 percent. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">Estimating the Number of Indoor Lights
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The number of indoor lights used 1 hour or more per
day can be predicted with some accuracy from knowing one fact
about people (the number of persons in the household) and one
fact about the housing structure (the number of rooms). The number
of indoor lights can be predicted from the following equation:
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>Number of Indoor Lights = 0.6 + 0.4*(number
of household members) + 0.7*(number of rooms)<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For this calculation, rooms are defined as kitchens,
dining rooms, living rooms, family rooms, and bedrooms. Rooms
do not include bathrooms, basements, or utility rooms. For example,
one person living in a four-room housing unit would be expected
to use about four lights for one hour or more per day. Other factors,
such as the age of the occupants, would be expected to affect
this estimate for any particular household. <BR>
