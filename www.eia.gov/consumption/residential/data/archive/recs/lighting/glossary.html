<B><FONT SIZE=2>Air-Conditioning:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>Air-conditioning
is one of the five end-use categories in this report. It is defined
as cooling and dehumidification of the air in a building by a
refrigeration unit driven by electricity or gas. This definition
excludes fans, blowers, or evaporative cooling systems (&quot;swamp
coolers&quot;) that are not connected to a refrigeration unit.
Air&#173;conditioning units that are not currently in working
condition or are not used are still included in the RECS if they
are in place in the housing unit. If the household did not use
its air-conditioning equipment during the summer of 1993, no consumption
and expenditures are imputed for air-conditioning. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Apartments: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>A housing
unit in a building with multiple units--a structure that is divided
into living quarters for more than one family or household and
where one household lives above another. Apartments can be located
in large buildings, garden apartment buildings, or in houses originally
intended for occupancy by one family (or some other use) that
have since been converted to separate dwellings for more than
one family. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Appliances:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>One of the
main end&#173;use categories in RECS. It is defined as the use
of energy for all uses except those covered by space heating,
water heating, refrigerators (starting with the 1990 RECS), and
air-conditioning. This includes energy used for freezers, lights,
televisions, personal computers, washing machines, and most small
appliances. Special energy uses for appliances are energy used
to heat: food, water for cooking, water for hot drinks, air to
dry clothes, water for a swimming pool, water in a water bed.
Also included is energy to operate fans for a central forced&#173;air
space&#173;heating system and energy for an evaporative cooling
system (swamp coolers). (See <B>End&#173;Use</B> and for a more

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Appliances Used:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>Appliances
used in the home during the year, including those loaned to the
householder for regular use. Appliances possessed by the household
but not used are not counted, except for air-conditioning equipment.
Appliances temporarily not in working condition but generally
used by the household are included only if a repair person has
been called or the appliance has been taken to a repair shop,
except for air-conditioning equipment. Cooking appliances include
the following: toaster oven, gas stove-top or burners, gas oven,
electric stove-top or burners, electric oven, microwave oven,
gas grill (that uses bottled gas or propane), and natural gas
grill. Stove&#173;top or burners include range tops and stand-alone
cook tops. Range burners and ovens are counted as separate appliances.
Cooling appliances include: evaporative cooler (swamp cooler),
whole-house or attic fan, exhaust fan, window fan, ceiling fan,
portable or table fan. Other appliances counted include: refrigerator,
freezer, dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer, swimming pool and
hot tub pump and heater, television, personal computer, laser
printer, waterbed heater, heated aquarium, humidifier, air cleaner,
facsimile machine, photocopier, portable space heater, and dehumidifier.

</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Clothes Washer:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>An appliance

its top or its front offering access to the washer tub. An agitator,
located within the tub, moves the articles to be cleaned through
the wash water. The machine is powered by an electric motor connected

</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Electricity:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>Metered electric
power supplied by a central utility company to a residence via
power lines. Since there are no volumetric measures of electricity,
as there are with the fossil fuels, electricity is measured as
the amount of power used at any instant (demand expressed in watts
or kilowatts) or as power used over a given time (consumption
expressed in kilowatthours). The heat equivalent for electricity
is 3,412 Btu per kWh, but this is a derived form of energy and
does not represent the amount of energy needed to generate the
electricity and transmit it to the building. Generation and transmission
requires about 3 times 3,412 Btu per kWh. Energy is used in preparing
other fuels for consumption from their condition as mined and
delivering them to a site for use, but these amounts of energy
are relatively small compared to the Btu value of the fuel consumed.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>End Use: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>A function for
which energy sources or fuels are used in the household. Five
main energy end-use categories were estimated: space heating,
air-conditioning, water heating, refrigerator, and appliance usage.
The amount of energy used for these end uses is estimated by means
of a nonlinear regression technique, rather than by using metered
data. Although not shown in the tables in Chapter 5, end-use estimates
were also made for the following uses of electricity: freezers,
lighting, dishwashers, clothes dryers, and cooking (ranges and
ovens). (See Appendix B, &quot;End-Use Estimation Methodology.&quot;)

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Energy:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>The capacity for
doing work as measured by the capability of doing work (potential
energy) or the conversion of the capability to motion (kinetic
energy). Energy has several forms, some of which are easily convertible
and can be changed to another form useful for work. Most of the
world's convertible energy comes from fossil fuels that are burned
to produce heat that is then used as a transfer medium to mechanical
or other means in order to accomplish tasks. Electrical energy
is usually measured in kilowatthours, while heat energy is usually
measured in British thermal units (Btu).<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Expenditures:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>Charges
spent for the energy consumed in, or delivered to, a building
during a given period of time. For this report, all expenditure
statistics are presented on an annual basis, for calendar year
1993. The total dollar amount includes State and local taxes but
excludes merchandise, repairs, or special service charges. For
households on a budget plan, the expenditures are for the actual
consumption. Electricity and natural gas expenditures are for
the amount of those energy sources consumed. Fuel oil, kerosene,
and LPG expenditures are for the amount of fuel purchased, which
may differ from the amount of fuel consumed. For households that
do not pay their fuel supplier directly, the expenditures for
fuels are estimated and included in the tables. (See <B>Consumption.</B>)

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Family Income</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> <B>Category:</B>
The income grouping for the total combined income (before taxes

for the 12 months prior to the interview. Sources of income include
the following: wages, salaries, tips, commissions, interest, dividends,
rental income, Social Security or railroad retirement, pensions,
food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, unemployment
compensation, Supplemental Security Income, General Assistance
and other public assistance. This definition includes the total
income of all family members who lived in the household during
the 12 months prior to the interview, regardless of whether they
were living there at the time of the interview. Income of nonfamily
members of the household is not included. &quot;Family&quot; includes
the following types of relationships: mother, father, sister,
brother, son, daughter, father&#173;in&#173;law, uncle, aunt,
niece, grandchild, foster child (and similar relationships).

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Floorspace:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>The floor
area of the housing unit that is enclosed from the weather. For
RECS, the following are included in the floorspace: basements,
whether or not they contain finished space; finished and/or heated
space in attics; and garages, if they have a wall in common with
the house. Not included are: crawl spaces, even if they are enclosed
from the weather; and sheds and other buildings that are not attached
to the house. Floorspace (in square feet) is derived from an actual
measurement made by the RECS interviewer using a metallic, retractable,
50&#173;foot tape measure. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Heated Floorspace&quot; is the portion of the
floorspace that is heated during most of the winter season. Rooms
that are shut off during the heating season to save fuel are not
counted as heated square footage. Attached garages that are unheated
and unheated areas in basements and attics are not counted as
heated square feet. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Cooled Floorspace&quot; is computed as total
floorspace times the percentage of rooms that are cooled over
total rooms. This method for calculating cooled floorspace is
different from the method used in <I>Housing Characteristics 1993</I>
that used heated floorspace rather than total floorspace. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Fluorescent Lamps:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>Usually
long, narrow, white tubes connected to a fixture at both ends;
some are circular. The tube is coated on the inside with fluorescent
material. The lamp produces light by passing electricity through
mercury vapor, which causes the fluorescent coating to glow or
fluoresce. These lights are typically found in kitchen and basement
work areas. Newer types (&quot;compact&quot; fluorescent lamps),
looking somewhat more like a conventional bulbs, can be screwed

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Household:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>A family, an
individual, or a group of up to nine unrelated persons, occupying
the same housing unit. &quot;Occupy&quot; means the housing unit
was the person's usual or permanent place of residence at the
time of the first field contact. Household members include babies,
lodgers, boarders, employed persons who live in the housing unit,
and persons who usually live in the household but are away traveling
or in a hospital. The household does not include (1) persons who
are normally members of the household but who were away from home
as college students or members of the armed forces at the time
of the contact; (2) persons temporarily visiting with the household
if they have a place of residence elsewhere; (3) persons who take
their meals with the household but usually lodge or sleep elsewhere;
(4) domestic employees or other persons employed by the household
who do not sleep in the same housing unit; and (5) persons who
are former members of the household, but have since become inmates
of correction or penal institutions, mental institutions, homes
for the aged or needy, homes or hospitals for the chronically
ill or handicapped, nursing homes, convents or monasteries, or
other places in which residents may remain for long periods of

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Housing Unit:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>A house,
an apartment, a group of rooms, or a single room if it is either
occupied, or intended for occupancy, as separate living quarters
by a family, an individual, or a group of one to nine unrelated
persons. Separate living quarters means the occupants (1) live
and eat separately from other persons in the house or apartment
and (2) have direct access from the outside of the building or
through a common hall&#173;&#173;that is, they can get to it without
going through someone else's living quarters. Housing units do
not include group quarters, such as prisons or nursing homes where

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Incandescent Lamp: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The
most common and among the least energy-efficient of all household
lamps. A lamp that produces light by electrically heating a tungsten
filament so that it glows and produces a soft, warm light. Because
so much of the energy used is lost as heat, these are highly inefficient
sources of light. Included in this category are the familiar household
light bulbs that screw into sockets, as well as more energy-efficient
incandescent bulbs, such as Tungsten Halogen (spotlights), Reflector
or R-lamps (accent and task lighting), Parabolic Aluminized Reflector
(PAR) lamps (flood and spot lighting), and Ellipsoidal Reflector

Floorspace estimates may be converted to metric units by using
this relationship: 1 square foot is approximately equal to .0929
square meters. Energy estimates may be converted to metric units
by using this relationship: 1 Btu is approximately equal to 1,055
joules. One kilowatthour is exactly equal to 3,600,000 joules.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Primary Electricity</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>: A
measurement of electricity that includes the approximate amount
of energy used to generate electricity. To approximate the adjusted
amount of electricity, the site&#173;value of the electricity
is multiplied by a factor of three. This conversion factor of
three is a rough approximation of the Btu value of raw fuels used
to generate electricity in a steam&#173;generation power plant.
In this report, electricity is represented as site energy. (See
<B>Site Energy </B>and<B> Btu Conversion Factors</B>.)<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Rooms:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>Subdivisions of
a housing unit. Whole rooms are rooms such as living rooms, dining
rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, lodgers' rooms, finished basements
or attic rooms, recreation rooms, and permanently enclosed sun
porches that are used year round. Rooms used for offices by a
person living in the unit are included in this survey. &quot;Finished&quot;
means that the ceiling and walls are covered with finishing materials.

<FONT SIZE=2>A partially divided room, such as a dinette next
to a kitchen or a living room, is considered a separate room only
if there is a partition from floor to ceiling&#173;&#173;but not
if the partition consists solely of shelves or cabinets. If a
room is used by occupants of more than one unit, the room is included
with the unit from which it is most easily reached. (See <B>Bedroom</B>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>RSE or Relative Standard Error:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>A
measure of the reliability or precision of a survey statistic.
The Relative Standard Error, or RSE, is defined as the standard
error of a survey estimate, expressed as a percent of the estimate.
For example, an RSE of 10 percent means that the standard error
is one-tenth as large as the survey estimate. The RSE is also
known as the coefficient of variation. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>RSE Row Factor:</FONT> </B><FONT SIZE=2>A factor
used to compute RSE's. The row factor is equal to the geometric
mean of the RSE's in a particular row of main tables. For a survey
estimate in a particular row and column of a table (that is, a
particular &quot;cell&quot;), the approximate RSE is obtained
by multiplying the RSE row factor by the RSE column factor for
that cell. (See <B>RSE or Relative Standard Error, RSE Column

housing unit that provides living space for one household or family.
The structure may be detached or attached to another unit. Attached
houses are considered single&#173;family houses as long as the
house itself is not divided into more than one housing unit and
has an independent outside entrance. A single&#173;family house
is contained within walls that go from the basement (or the ground
floor, if there is no basement) to the roof. Townhouses, rowhouses,
and duplexes are considered single&#173;family attached housing
units, as long as there is no household living above another one
within the walls that go from the basement to the roof to separate
the units. A mobile home with one or more rooms added is classified
as a single&#173;family home.<BR>
