     The sample design for RECS is not a simple random sample. Consequently,
     to estimate the number or percent of households/housing units with a
     certain characteristic, the sampling weight should be used.  The
     variable NWEIGHT is the sampling weight for the observation.  It is
     approximately the inverse of the probability of selection.  It gives the
     number of households that the response represents in the sample.  For
     most categorical variables, the codebooks contain both the unweighted
     frequency and the weighted frequency.  The unweighted frequency gives
     the number of observations, the weighted frequency gives survey estimate
     of the number of households/housing units for each possible value of the
     variable.  The weighted frequencies are rounded to the nearest 100,000
     households.  This is the limit of the accuracy for RECS.  When the
     unweighted frequency is less than 10 or the weighted frequency is less
     than 150,000; then weighted frequency is suppressed.  A 'Q' is placed in
     the frequency to denote that the number is suppressed.  This indicates
     that there are too few observation upon which to determine an accurate
     estimate.

     Q = Data withheld because fewer than 10 observation in the category.

     When MQRESULT equals 1 or 2, the household and housing unit data was not
     obtained via a personal interview.  The data were obtained using a
     shortened mail questionnaire.  A hot-deck imputation procedure was used
     to match each mail respondent to a personal interview respondent.  The
     critical matching variables were FUELHEAT, FUELH2O, TYPECOOL, TYPEHUQ,
     and REGIONC.  Additional variables used in a scoring function to
     determine the best match were MONEYPY, NHSLDMEM, VEHICLES, HHAGE, and
     TOTROOMS.  The remaining household/housing unit characteristics for the
     mail respondents were determined by the values of the matched personal
     interview respondent.  The energy consumption and expenditures data for
     the mail respondents was based upon data obtained from their energy
     suppliers.  It was not imputed using a hot deck procedure.

     Questionnaire data from personal interview respondents sometime is
     missing and needs to be imputed.  'Z' variables are used to indicate the
     presence of imputed data.  For example, if ZURBRUR = 0 then URBRUR was
     not imputed.  If ZURBRUR = 1 then URBRUR was imputed.

     Cooling degree days are the number of degrees the average daily
     temperature (ADT) is above the base temperature.  Heating degree days
     are the number of degrees the ADT is below the base temperature.  To
     calculate daily degree days (base 65 degrees):

          ADT = (daily high + daily low)/2

          CDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT <= 65
                         = ADT - 65     if ADT > 65

          HDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT >= 65
                         = 65 - ADT     if ADT < 65.

          Annual degrees days are calculated by summing the daily degree days. 
     The .5 is carried over in the summation.  The total is rounded up after
     the summation.

     There is a fine line between the definitions of various types of housing
     units. The distinction between a single-family attached unit and a unit
     in an apartment building is particularly complex. The collection and
     editing of the data on housing type changed from the paper-and-pencil
     questionnaire for the 1993 RECS to the CAPI questionnaire for the 1997
     RECS. The change in the data collection and editing procedures may have
     contributed to changes in the survey results. For example, the estimated
     number of occupied single-family attached units increased from 7.3
     million for the 1993 RECS to 10.0 million for the 1997 RECS. Conversely,
     the number of occupied housing units in buildings with two to four units
     decreased from 8.0 million for the 1993 RECS to 5.6 million for the 1997
     RECS.
