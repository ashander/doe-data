          The variable DOEID will be on all files.  Each respondent is assigned
     an unique value of DOEID.  It can be used to merge data from one file
     with data from another file.

     Maximum Value: 5,852

          The sample design for RECS is not a simple random sample.
     Consequently, to estimate the number or percent of households/housing units
     with a certain characteristic, the sampling weight should be used.  The
     variable NWEIGHT is the sampling weight for the observation.  It is
     approximately the inverse of the probability of selection.  It gives
     the number of households that the response represents in the sample. 
     For most categorical variables, the codebooks contain both the
     unweighted frequency and the weighted frequency.  The unweighted
     frequency gives the number of observations, the weighted frequency
     gives survey estimate of the number of households/housing units for
     each possible value of the variable.  The weighted frequencies are
     rounded to the nearest 100,000 households.  This is the limit of the
     accuracy for RECS.  When the unweighted frequency is less than 10 or
     the weighted frequency is less than 150,000; then weighted frequency is
     suppressed.  A 'Q' is placed in the frequency to denote that the number
     is suppressed.  This indicates that there are too few observation upon
     which to determine an accurate estimate.

     Q = Data withheld because fewer than 10 observation in the category.

          When MQRESULT equals 1 2, or 3, the household and housing unit data
     was not obtained via a personal interview.  The data were obtained using a
     shortened mail questionnaire.  A hot-deck imputation procedure was used
     to match each mail respondent to a personal interview respondent.  The
     critical matching variables were FUELHEAT, FUELH2O, TYPECOOL, TYPEHUQ,
     and REGIONC.  Additional  variables used in a scoring function to


     determine the best match were MONEYPY, NHSLDMEM, VEHICLES, HHAGE, and

     TOTROOMS.  The remaining household/housing unit characteristics for the
     mail respondents were determined by the values of the matched personal
     interview respondent.  The energy consumption and expenditures data for

     the mail respondents was based upon data obtained from their energy
     suppliers.  It was not imputed using a hot deck procedure.

          Questionnaire data from personal interview respondents sometime is
     missing and needs to be imputed.  'Z' variables are used to indicate
     the presence of imputed data.  For example, if ZURBRUR = 0 then URBRUR
     was not imputed.  If ZURBRUR = 1 then URBRUR was imputed.

          Cooling degree days are the number of degrees the average daily     temperature (ADT) is above the base temperature.  Heating degree days
     are the number of degrees the ADT is below the base temperature.  To
     calculate daily degree days (base 65 degrees):



          ADT = (daily high + daily low)/2
          CDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT <= 65
                         = ADT - 65     if ADT > 65

          HDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT >= 65
                         = 65 - ADT     if ADT < 65.

          Annual degrees days are calculated by summing the daily degree days. 
     The .5 is carried over in the summation.  The total is rounded up after
     the summation.
