          <p><strong>Account Classification:</strong> The method in which suppliers of electricity, natural gas, or fuel oil classify and bill their customers. Commonly used account classifications are &quot;Commercial,&quot; &quot;Industrial,&quot; &quot;Residential,&quot; and &quot;Other&quot; Suppliers' definitions of these terms vary from supplier to supplier and from the definitions used in the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). In addition, the same customer may be classified differently by each of its energy suppliers.</p>
          <p><strong>Adequacy of Insulation: </strong>The respondent's perception of the adequacy of the housing unit's insulation.</p>
          <p><strong>Aggregate Ratio: </strong>The ratio of two population aggregates (totals). For example, the aggregate expenditures per household is the ratio of the total expenditures in each category to the total number of households in the category.</p>
          <p><strong>Air-Conditioning<a name="ac" id="ac"></a>:</strong> One of the five major end-use categories in the RECS tables and analyses. Cooling and dehumidifying the air in a building by a refrigeration unit powered by electricity or natural gas. This definition excludes fans, blowers, or evaporative cooling systems (swamp coolers) that are not connected to a refrigeration unit. (See<strong> <a href="terminology.cfm.html#end_use">End Use</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href="terminology.cfm.html#refri_unit">Refrigeration Unit</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Air-Conditioning Equipment<a name="air_equip" id="air_equip"></a>:</strong> Either a central system, window or wall units that cool the air in a housing unit by a refrigeration unit powered by electricity or natural gas. This definition excludes fans, blowers, or evaporative cooling systems (swamp coolers) that are not connected to a refrigeration unit. Air-conditioning units that were not in working condition or were not used are included if they were in place in the housing unit. Housing units interviewed were asked how the air-conditioning equipment will be used in the summer; housing units interviewed between July 1st and August 30th were asked how did they use their air-conditioning equipment during the summer. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#room_air">Room Air-Conditioner</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Appliances<a name="appliance" id="appliance"></a>:</strong> One of the five major end-use categories in the RECS tables and analyses report. This definition includes appliances and lights used in the home during the year, including those loaned to the householder for regular use. Appliances not currently being used are not counted unless they are temporarily out of working order and a repairperson has been called or the appliance has been taken to a repair shop. Refrigerators are a separate end use. (See<strong> <a href="terminology.cfm.html#end_use">End Use</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Appliance Combination:</strong> Refers to the stub on the appliance end-use consumption table. Households are characterized as using or not using a particular combination of appliances.</p>
          <p><strong>Appliance Efficiency Standards:</strong> The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 established minimum efficiency standards for major home appliances, including furnaces, central and room air-conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, water heaters, dishwashers, and heat pumps. Most of the standards were effective in 1990. The standards for clothes washers, dishwashers, and ranges were effective in 1988 because they required only minor changes in product design, such as eliminating pilot lights and requiring cold water rinse options. The standards for central air-conditioners and furnaces were effective in 1992, because it took longer to redesign these products. The standards for refrigerators were effective in 1993; virtually no refrigerator models on the market in 1990 met the 1993 standards.</p>
          <p><strong>Authorization Form<a name="auth_form" id="auth_form"></a>: </strong>The one-page form signed by respondents that gives their energy suppliers permission to release information about the energy used during a specified reporting period.</p>
          <p><strong>Average: </strong>The simple arithmetic average for a population; that is, the sum of all the values in a population divided by the size of the population. Population means are estimated by computing the weighted sum of the sample values, then dividing by the sum of the sample weights. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#weight">Weight</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Average Age of Appliances:</strong> Respondents were provided five categories to determine the age of selected appliances (central and room air-conditioners, first and second refrigerators, freezers, water heaters and their main heating system). The midpoint of each category was used to estimate an average age of the appliances. The midpoints for each age category were as follows:</p>

A one-room efficiency or studio apartment has no bedrooms.</p>
          <p><strong>Billing Period:</strong> The time between meter readings or fuel deliveries. It does not refer to the time when the bill was sent or when the payment was to have been received. In some cases, the billing period is the same as the billing cycle that corresponds closely (within several days) to meter-reading dates. For fuel oil and LPG, the billing period is the number of days between fuel deliveries.</p>
          <p><strong>Boiler: </strong>A type of space-heating equipment consisting of a vessel or tank where heat produced from the combustion of such fuels as natural gas, fuel oil, or coal is used to generate hot water or steam.</p>

          <p><strong>Central Air-Conditioning:</strong> In the RECS tables, a category including households that use both room/wall air-conditioners and central air-conditioning. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#air_equip">Air-Conditioning Equipment</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Central City<a name="c_city" id="c_city"></a>:</strong> Usually one or more legally incorporated cities within the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) that is significantly large by itself or large relative to the largest city in the MSA. Additional criteria for being classified &quot;central city&quot; include having at least 75 jobs for each 100 employed residents and having at least 40 percent of the resident workers employed within the city limits. Every MSA has at least one central city, which is usually the largest city. Central cities are commonly regarded as relatively large communities with a denser population and a higher concentration of economic activities than the outlying or suburban areas of the MSA. Suburban are those parts of the MSA that are not designated as central city. In the RECS tables and analyses, report, the central city and suburban areas are called urban; in previous RECS reports, these components were referred to as metropolitan areas. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#metro">Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#suban">Suburban</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#urban">Urban</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Central Warm-Air Furnace<a name="cwaf" id="cwaf"></a>:</strong> A type of space-heating equipment where a central combustor or resistance unit generally using natural gas, fuel oil, or electricity, provides warm air through ducts leading to the various rooms. Heat pumps are not included in this category. A forced-air furnace is one in which a fan forces air through the ducts. In a gravity furnace, air is circulated by gravity relying on the natural flow of warm air up and cold air down; the warm air rises through ducts and the cold air falls through ducts that return it to the furnace to be reheated, thus completing the circulation cycle.</p>

          <p><strong>Climate Zone<a name="clim_zone" id="clim_zone"></a>:</strong> One of five climatically distinct areas, defined by long-term weather conditions affecting the heating and cooling loads in buildings. The zones were developed by the Energy Consumption Division in the Energy Information Administration (EIA) from seven distinct climate categories originally identified by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) for the U. S. Department of Energy and the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The zones were determined according to the 30-year average (1951- 1980) of the annual heating and cooling degree-days (base 65 degrees Fahrenheit). The zones are defined as follows:</p>

          <p>An individual household was assigned to a climate zone according to the 30-year average annual degree-days for an appropriate nearby weather station. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#cdd">Cooling Degree-Days (CDD</a>) ) </strong>and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#hdd">Heating Degree-Days</a> (HDD)</strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Clothes Dryer:</strong> An appliance in the home that dries laundry using heat and rapid air movement. The hot air used is typically heated by electricity or gas (either natural gas or LPG).</p>
          <p><strong>Clothes Washer:</strong> An appliance in the home for cleaning laundry opens from the top or front for gaining access to the tub. An agitator, located within the tub, moves the articles to be cleaned through the wash water. The machine is powered by an electric motor connected to the tub and agitator via a transmission, clutches, and linkages. In front-loading machines, the articles are moved by a rotating tube rather than an agitator.</p>
          <p><strong>Coal<a name="coal" id="coal"></a>:</strong> A combustible mineral substance (carbonized vegetable matter). In the RECS tables and analyses, the term includes its derivative, coke, which is formed by destructive distillation or imperfect combustion. Data on the use of coal were collected but consumption and expenditure data were not collected.</p>
          <p><strong>Conditional End-Use Intensity<a name="end_inten" id="end_inten"></a> (CEUI):</strong> A measure of how intensely energy is used that allows comparisons across housing units and households by adjusting either the end-use consumption or expenditures for the effects of certain characteristics, such as floorspace, degree-days, or household members for households that use an energy source for a particular end use. In the case of space-heating intensity, only the heated floorspace and heating degree-days are used. The air-conditioning intensity uses only the cooled floorspace and cooling degree-days. The water-heating intensity adjusts consumption and expenditures for the effects of the number of household members on water-heating consumption.</p>
          <p><strong>Conditional Energy Intensity<a name="ce_intensity" id="ce_intensity"></a>:</strong> A measure of how intensely energy is used that allows comparisons across housing units and households by adjusting either energy consumption or expenditures for the effects of certain characteristics, such as weather, size of unit, and number of household members for households that use a particular energy source. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#end_inten">Conditional End-Use Intensity</a></strong> and <a href="terminology.cfm.html#inten"><strong>Intensity</strong></a>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Condo Fee:</strong> When living in condominiums, this fee is paid to the homeowners&rsquo; association for maintenance, management, insurance, and, in some cases, utilities.</p>
          <p><strong>Condominium:</strong> An apartment or house owned in a housing complex project of similar units. The owner has his/her own deed and, most likely, his/her mortgage on the unit. The owner also holds a common or joint ownership on all common areas, such as hallways, entrances, and elevators. Ownership may cover single-family houses, including row houses and townhouses, as well as apartments.</p>
          <p><strong>Consumption<a name="consumption" id="consumption"></a>:</strong> The amount of electricity or natural gas used by, or delivered to, a household during a 365-day period. For fuel oil, kerosene, and LPG, the quantity represents fuel purchased, not fuel consumed. If the level of fuel in the tank was the same at the beginning and end of the annual period, then the quantity consumed would be the same as the quantity purchased. Measurements or reports of the actual level of fuel in the tank were not included in the RECS data collection.</p>
          <p><strong>Control Total:</strong> The number of elements in the population or a subset of the population. The sample weights for the observed elements in a survey are adjusted so that they add up to the control total. The value of a control total is not obtained from RECS; it is obtained from an outside source. In the RECS tables and analyses, the control totals are obtained from the Current Population Survey. (See <strong><a href="data/2001/index.html#tabs-4s">Survey Methods</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Conversion Factors:</strong> See <a href="terminology.cfm.html#btu"><strong>Btu Conversion Factors</strong></a> and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#Metric_Fact">Metric Conversion Factors</a></strong>.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="cstove" id="cstove"></a>Cooking Stove:</strong> A stove built for cooking food in order to prepare a meal. In the RECS, it may also be used as the main heating equipment. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#heat_equip">Heating Equipment</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Cooled Floorspace:</strong> The total floorspace times the percentage of rooms that are cooled over total rooms. This method for calculating cooled floorspace is different from the method used in <em>Housing Characteristics 1993 </em>that used heated floorspace rather than total floorspace.</p>
          <p><strong>Cooling Degree-Days<a name="cdd" id="cdd"></a> (CDD):</strong> A measure of how hot a location was over a period of time, relative to a base temperature. In the RECS tables and analyses, the base temperature is 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and the period of time is one year. The cooling degree-days for a single day is the difference between that day's average temperature and the base temperature if the daily average is greater than the base; it is zero if the daily average temperature is less than or equal to the base temperature. The number of cooling degree-days for a longer period of time is the sum of the daily cooling degree-days for the days in that period. Cooling degree-days can also be calculated by using a base temperature other than 65 degrees. The computation is performed in an analogous manner. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#clim_zone">Climate Zone</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Cord of Wood:</strong> An amount of stacked wood measuring 4 feet by 4 feet by 8 feet, or 128 cubic feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Crawl Space:</strong> Space between the ground and the floor of a house in which a person cannot walk upright. An enclosed crawl space is one not accessible from the outside of the house (except by a door or window) because the walls of the crawl space protect it from the weather. A crawl space &quot;open to the outside&quot; is accessible from outside the house, even though it may be covered by a trellis or lathwork or some kind of brickwork that leaves space for circulation of air.</p>
          <p><strong>Cubic Foot (cf):</strong> As a natural gas measure, the volume of gas contained in a cube with an edge that is 1 foot long at standard temperature and pressure (60 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.73 pounds standard per square inch) in a cube whose edges are one foot long. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#btu">Btu Conversion Factors</a></strong>and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#natural_gas">Natural Gas</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Current Dollars:</strong> Unless otherwise noted, all dollar values presented in the RECS tables and analyses are expressed in the current dollars at the time of data collection. The dollar amounts are not directly comparable across time periods since they have not been adjusted for the effects of inflation. In contrast, real dollars are current dollars that have been adjusted for the effects of inflation.</p>
          <div class="glossary_title"><a name="d" id="d"></a>D</div><br />
          <p><strong>Dishwasher: </strong>A built-in or portable appliance used for automatically cleaning dishware, utensils, and cutlery. The national appliance efficiency standards required that, by 1988, dishwashers be equipped with an option to dry without heat.</p>
          <div class="glossary_title"><a name="e" id="e"></a>E</div><br />
          <p><strong>Electric Air-Conditioning Intensity:</strong> In the RECS tables and analyses, the ratio of end-use electric air-conditioning consumption or expenditures to square footage of cooled floorspace and cooling degree-days (CDD) (base 65 degrees Fahrenheit). Only the CDD and square feet for households that have air-conditioning equipment are included in the ratio. The intensity provides a way of comparing different types of housing units and households by controlling for differences in housing unit size and weather conditions. The square footage of cooled floorspace is equal to the product of the total square footage times the ratio of the number of rooms that are cooled to the total number of rooms. If the entire housing unit is cooled, the cooled floorspace is the same as the total floorspace. The ratio is calculated on a weighted, aggregate basis.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="ele_pump" id="ele_pump"></a>Electric Pump for Well Water: </strong>A pump that draws the water from a well below ground level up into the water pipes that circulates through the house.</p>
          <p><strong>Electricity<a name="electricity" id="electricity"></a>:</strong> For the RECS tables and analyses, metered electric power delivered by a central utility company to a residence via power lines. Because there are no volumetric measures of electricity as with the fossil fuels, electricity is measured as the amount of power used at any instant (demand expressed in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW)) or as power used over a given time (consumption expressed in kWh). The heat equivalent for electricity is 3,412 Btu per kWh, but this is a derived form of energy and does not represent the amount of energy needed to generate the electricity and transmit it to the building. Generation and transmission requires about 3 times 3,412 Btu per kWh, or 11,620 Btu per kWh. Energy is used in preparing other fuels for consumption from their condition as mined and delivering them to a site for use, but these amounts of energy are relatively small compared to the Btu value of the fuel consumed. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#prim_ele">Primary Electricity</a></strong> and <a href="terminology.cfm.html#btu"><strong>Btu Conversion Factors</strong></a>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Electricity Paid by Household:</strong> The household paid the electric utility company directly for all household uses of electricity (such as water heating, space heating, air-conditioning, cooking, lighting, and operating appliances.) Bills paid by a third party are not counted as paid by the household.</p>
          <p><strong>Eligible for Federal Assistance:</strong> Households are categorized as eligible for Federal energy assistance if their income is below the Federal standard. The Federal standard is 150 percent of the poverty line or 60 percent of statewide median income, whichever is the higher income. Individual States can set the standard at a lower level than the Federal one. (See <a href="terminology.cfm.html#poverty"><strong>Poverty Line</strong></a>.)</p>
          <p><a name="end_use" id="end_se"></a><strong>End Use:</strong> A function for which fuels (energy sources) are used in the household. In RECS, there are five major energy end-use categories that were estimated: space heating, air-conditioning, water heating, refrigerators, and appliances. The amount of energy used for these end uses is estimated by means of a nonlinear regression technique, rather than by data that are actually measured. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#space_heat">Space Heating</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#ac">Air-Conditioning</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#wh">Water Heating</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#frig">Refrigerators</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#appliance">Appliances</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Energy Source:</strong> A type of energy or fuel used by the household. Electricity is included as a fuel. The energy sources identified for the RECS tables and analyses are electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (propane), wood, coal, and solar. The major fuels are electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#Electricity">Electricity</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#natural_gas">Natural Gas</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#Fuel_oil">Fuel Oil</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#kerosene">Kerosene</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#lpg">Liquefied Petroleum Gas</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#wood">Wood</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#coal">Coal</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#s_energy">Solar Energy</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Energy Supplier:</strong> A company that provides electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, or LPG to the household. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#auth_form">Authorization Form</a></strong> and <strong><a href="data/2001/index.html#tabs-4">Survey Methods</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Estimated Bill:</strong> A set of charges for a fuel, calculated by the supplier when the meter is not read. The estimate may be based on one or more of the following factors: past usage, usage by similar households, and weather data.</p>
          <p><strong>Evaporative Cooler (Swamp Cooler): </strong>A type of cooling equipment using the evaporation of water to cool air. This type of equipment is commonly found in warm, dry climates. Evaporative cooling units do not cool air by use of a refrigeration unit, so for the RECS tables and analyses, they are not considered air-conditioning equipment, and are listed with appliances.</p>
          <p><strong>Expenditures: </strong>Money spent for the energy used in, or delivered to, a housing unit during a given period of time. For the RECS tables and analyses, all expenditure statistics are presented on an annual basis. The total dollar amount includes State and local taxes but excludes merchandise, repairs, or special service charges. Electricity and natural gas expenditures are for the amount of those energy sources consumed. Fuel oil, kerosene, and LPG expenditures are for the amount of fuel purchased, which may differ from the amount of fuel consumed. For households that do not pay their fuel supplier directly, the expenditures for fuels are estimated. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#consumption">Consumption</a></strong>)</p>
          <p><strong>Expenditures as a Percentage of Income</strong>: The annual household energy expenditures divided by the household&rsquo;s annual income. The median percentage of income is the percentage spent on energy for the household, for the middle-income value in the population when the households are ranked by the percentage they spend on energy. That is, 50 percent of the weighted households in the cell spend a lower percentage on energy than the median value.</p>
          <div class="glossary_title"><a name="f" id="f"></a>F</div><br />
          <p><strong>Facsimile Machine (FAX):</strong> Equipment that transmits and receives printed material over telephone lines.</p>
          <p><strong>Fireplace:</strong> Usually a masonry unit, which burns wood, is built into the wall of a house and has a permanent chimney. Fireplaces in mobile homes are included. Fireplaces may have glass doors or metal shields to cover the opening into the room. Included are fireplaces that use equipment fueled by natural gas or LPG. These gas fireplaces may or may not have a flue to the outside. Accessories, such as convective grates or radiant grates, may be present to increase the efficiency of the fireplace. A freestanding fireplace that can be detached from its chimney is a heating stove.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="floorspace" id="floorspace"></a>Floorspace:</strong> The floor area of the housing unit that is enclosed by exterior walls. For the RECS tables and analyses, the following are included: basements, whether or not they contain finished space; finished and/or heated space in attics; and garages, if they have a wall in common with the house. Not included are: crawl spaces, even if they are enclosed from the weather, and sheds and other buildings that are not attached to the house. The floorspace was actually measured in contrast to 1997 when it was estimated.</p>
          <p><strong>Floor, Wall, or Pipeless Furnace<a name="fwp_furnace" id="fwp_furnace"></a>: </strong>Space-heating equipment consisting of a ductless combustor or resistance unit, having an enclosed chamber where fuel is burned or where electrical-resistance heat is generated to warm the rooms of a building. A floor furnace is located below the floor and delivers heated air to the room immediately above or (if under a partition) to the room on each side. A wall furnace is installed in a partition or in an outside wall and delivers heated air to the rooms on one or both sides of the wall. A pipeless furnace is installed in a basement and delivers heated air through a large register in the floor of the room or hallway immediately above.</p>
          <p><strong>Freezer: </strong>An electric motor driven refrigeration unit designed for storing food at temperatures of about 0 degrees Fahrenheit and having a refrigeration unit driven by an electric motor. This is a separate appliance, not part of the refrigerator and can be an upright model (vertical unit with the door opening outward) or a chest model (horizontal unit with the door opening upward).</p>
          <p><strong>Frost-Free:</strong> A freezer, either separated from or attached to a refrigerator, that automatically defrosts usually on 12- or 24- hour cycles.</p>
          <p><strong>Fuel:</strong> A type of energy or fuel used by the household. Electricity is included as a fuel. The fuels identified for the RECS tables and analyses are electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, LPG (propane), wood, coal, and solar. The major fuels are electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, and LPG.

          <p><strong>Fuel Oil<a name="fuel_oil" id="fuel_oil"></a>:</strong> A liquid petroleum product less volatile than gasoline that is burned for space-heating or water-heating purposes. No. 1 distillate fuel oil is used mostly as a blending stock to assure that heavier grades of fuel flow under severe cold weather conditions. No. 2 fuel oil is the most common form of heating oil. No. 2 distillate collectively refers to No. 2 heating oil and No. 2 diesel fuel. Although these products are not precisely identical, they are essentially interchangeable in most applications. No. 4 distillate is a blend of No. 2 and No. 5 or No. 6 residual fuel oil, which is used in large, stationary diesel engines and boilers equipped with fuel preheating equipment.</p>
          <p><strong>Fuel Oil Paid by Household:</strong> The household paid the supplier directly for all household uses of fuel oil or kerosene (such as space heating or water heating). Bills paid by a third party are not counted as paid by the householder.</p>
          <p><strong>Furnace:</strong> Space-heating equipment consisting of an enclosed chamber where fuel is burned or electrical resistance is used to heat air directly, without using steam or hot water. The warm air is for heating, and is distributed throughout the house, typically by air ducts.</p>
          <p><strong>Furnace Fan: </strong>A fan that forces air through the ducts of a central warm-air furnace.</p>
          <div class="glossary_title"><a name="g" id="g"></a>G</div><br />
          <p><strong>Garage:</strong> A space large enough to accommodate a car, with a door opening at least 6 feet wide and 7 feet high.</p>
          <p><strong>Gas Paid by Household: </strong>The household paid the utility company directly for all household uses of natural gas (such as water heating, space heating, air-conditioning, cooking, and operating appliances, including outdoor gas lights). Bills paid by a third party are not counted as being paid by the householder.</p>
          <p><strong>Group Quarters<a name="group_q" id="group_q"></a>:</strong> Living arrangement for institutional groups containing 10 or more unrelated persons. Such quarters are excluded from the RECS. Group quarters are typically found in hospitals, nursing homes, military barracks, halfway houses, college dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, convents, monasteries, shelters, jails, and correctional institutions. Group quarters may also be found in houses or apartments shared by 10 or more unrelated persons. Group quarters are often equipped with a dining area for residents. <strong>(See <a href="terminology.cfm.html#house_unit">Housing Unit</a>.)</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Heat Pump<a name="Heat_Pump" id="Heat_Pump"></a> (Reverse Cycle System): </strong>A year-round heating and air-conditioning system in which refrigeration equipment supplies both heating and cooling through ducts leading to individual rooms. A heat pump generally consists of a compressor, both indoor and outdoor coils, and a thermostat. In the RECS, all heat pumps are considered to be electric.</p>
          <p><strong>Heated Aquarium:</strong> A tank, usually made of glass, containing fish and holding 20 or more gallons of heated water. A 20-gallon tank measures approximately 30 inches by 2 inches by 12 inches.</p>
          <p><strong>Heated Floorspace:</strong> The area that is heated during most of the winter season as estimated by the respondent. Rooms that are shut off during the heating season to save fuel are not counted as heated square footage. Attached garages that are unheated and unheated areas in basements and attics are not counted as heated square feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Heating Degree-Days<a name="hdd" id="hdd"></a> (HDD):</strong> A measure of how cold a location was over a period of time, relative to a base temperature. In the RECS tables and analyses, the base temperature used is 65 degrees Fahrenheit and the period of time is one year. The heating degree-days for a single day is the difference between the base temperature and the day's average temperature if the daily average is less than the base, and zero if the daily average temperature is greater than or equal to the base temperature. The heating degree-days for a longer period of time are the sum of the daily heating degree-days for days in that period.

          <p><strong>Hot-Deck Imputation:</strong> A statistical procedure for deriving a probable response to a questionnaire item for which a response is missing. To perform the procedure, an analyst sorts the households by variables related to the missing item. Thus, a series of sort categories are formed, which are internally homogeneous with respect to the sort variables. Within each category, households for which the questionnaire item is not missing are randomly selected to serve as &quot;donors&quot; to supply values for the missing item of &quot;recipient&quot; households. (See <strong><a href="data/2001/index.html#tabs-4">Survey Methods</a>.</strong>)</p>

          <p><strong>Housing Unit<a name="House_Unit" id="House_Unit"></a>:</strong> A house, an apartment, a group of rooms, or a single room if it is either occupied or intended for occupancy as separate living quarters by a family, an individual, or a group of one to nine unrelated persons. Separate living quarters means the occupants (1) live and eat separately from other persons in the house or apartment and (2) have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall--that is, they can get to it without going through someone else's living quarters. Housing units do not include group quarters where 10 or more unrelated persons live. Hotel and motel rooms are considered housing units if occupied as the usual or permanent place of residence.

          <p><strong>Refrigeration Unit:<a name="refri_unit" id="refri_unit"></a></strong> A unit used to produce cooling in refrigerators, freezers, and air-conditioning equipment. In a typical refrigeration unit, electricity powers a motor that runs a pump to compress a refrigerant to maintain proper pressure. (A &ldquo;refrigerant&rdquo; is a substance that changes between liquid and gaseous forms under desirable temperature and pressure conditions.) Heat from the compressed liquid is removed and discharged from the unit, and the refrigerant evaporates when pressure is reduced. As it evaporates, it picks up heat and returns to the compressor to repeat the cycle. A few refrigeration units use gas (either natural gas or LPG) in an absorption process that does not use a compressor. The gas is burned to heat a chemical solution in which the refrigerant has been absorbed. Heating drives off the refrigerant, which is later condensed and evaporates by released pressure and, in turn, picks up heat. The evaporated refrigerant is then absorbed back into the chemical solution and the heat is removed from the solution, discharged as waste heat; then the process repeats itself. By definition, refrigerators, freezers, and air-conditioning equipment all contain refrigeration units.</p>
          <p><strong>Refrigerators:<a name="frig" id="frig"></a></strong> A cabinet designed for cooling food at temperatures above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Most refrigerators have a second compartment for freezing and storing frozen foods at temperatures of 8 degrees Fahrenheit or below.</p>
          <p><strong>Regression Imputation:</strong> A statistical technique for predicting the value of a numerical variable that is missing. The technique involves developing a regression equation that predicts the value of the missing variable based upon variables that are not missing or have already been imputed. A random error is usually added to the predicted value. The sum of the predicted value and the random error are used as the imputed value for the missing variable.</p>
          <p><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Energy obtained from sources that are essentially inexhaustible (unlike, for example, the fossil fuels, of which there is a finite supply).

Whole rooms are rooms such as living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, lodgers' rooms, finished basements or attic rooms, recreation rooms, and permanently enclosed sun porches that are used year round. Rooms used for offices by a person living in the unit are included. &quot;Finished&quot; means that the ceiling and walls are covered with finishing materials.</p>
          <p>Not considered to be rooms in this survey are bathrooms, halls, foyers or vestibules, balconies, closets, alcoves, pantries, strip or pullman kitchens, laundry or furnace rooms, unfinished attics or basements, open porches, and unfinished space used for storage.</p>
          <p>A partially divided room, such as a dinette next to a kitchen or a living room, is considered a separate room only if there is a partition from floor to ceiling--but not if the partition consists solely of shelves or cabinets. If a room is used by occupants of more than one unit, the room is included with the unit from which it is most easily reached.

          <p><strong>RSE or Relative Standard Error<a name="rse_error" id="rse_error"></a>:</strong> A measure of the reliability or precision of a survey statistic on a percentage scale. Variability occurs in survey statistics because different samples that could be drawn would each produce different values for the survey statistics. The RSE is defined as the standard error (the square root of the variance) of a survey estimate, divided by the survey estimate and multiplied by 100 (expressed as a percent of the estimate). For example, an RSE of 10 percent means that the standard error is one-tenth as large as the survey estimate. The RSE is also known as the coefficient of variation. For a survey estimate in a particular row and column of a table (that is, a particular &quot;cell&quot;), the approximate RSE is obtained by multiplying the RSE row factor by the RSE column factor for that cell.</p>
          <p><strong>RSE Row Factor:</strong> An adjustment factor that appears to the right of each row of the detailed tables and is used to compute RSE's. The row factor is equal to the geometric mean of the RSE&rsquo;s in a particular row of the main tables. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#rse_factor">RSE Column Factor</a></strong> and <a href="terminology.cfm.html#rse_error"><strong>RSE or Relative Standard Error</strong></a><strong>.)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Rural<a name="rural" id="rural"></a>:</strong> Households not located within MSA&rsquo;s as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in 1993. In the RECS tables, rural is included in the Metropolitan Statistical Area Status category, which is based on the definition provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for 1997 and rural is included in the Urban/Rural Location category, which is based on the respondent's judgment. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#metro">Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>, <a href="terminology.cfm.html#urban_rural">Urban/Rural Location</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#metros">Metropolitan Statistical Area Status</a></strong>.)</p>

          <p><strong>Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER):</strong> Ratio of the cooling output divided by the power consumption. It is the Btu of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in watt-hours during the same period. This is a measure of the cooling performance for rating central air-conditioners and central heat pumps. The appliance standards require a minimum SEER of 10 for split-system central air-conditioners and for split-system central heat pumps. These new standards took effect in 1992. (The average heat pump or central air-conditioner sold in 1986 had a SEER of about 9.)</p>
          <p><strong>Seasonal Units<a name="s_units" id="s_units"></a>:</strong> Housing units intended for occupancy at only certain seasons of the year. Included are units intended only for recreational use, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units are not usually included in the RECS occupied housing unit count unless they are occupied for more than half of the year. (See<a href="terminology.cfm.html#prim_res"> <strong>Primary Residence</strong></a>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Second Home:</strong> By definition, a second home is not the primary residence of a householder and is not included in the RECS occupied housing unit count. (See<strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#house_unit">Housing Unit</a></strong>,<strong> <a href="terminology.cfm.html#prim_res">Primary Residence</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#s_units">Seasonal Unit</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Secondary Heating Equipment:</strong> Space-heating equipment used less often than the main space-heating equipment.</p>
          <p><strong>Secondary Heating Fuel:</strong> Fuels used in secondary space-heating equipment.</p>
          <p><strong>Setback Temperature Behavior:</strong> These data were derived from differences in the temperature settings reported by respondents for their daytime temperature when someone is at home, daytime temperature when no one is at home, and the temperature for sleeping hours (assumed to be nighttime). For example, if a respondent's reported temperature setting was lower when no one was at home than when someone was at home, respondents were assumed to be &quot;setting&quot; back the temperature.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="sfamily" id="sfamily"></a>Single-Family Housing Unit:</strong> A housing unit, detached or attached, that provides living space for one household or family. Attached houses are considered single-family houses as long as they are not divided into more than one housing unit and they have independent outside entrance. A single-family house is contained within walls extending from the basement (or the ground floor, if there is no basement) to the roof. A mobile home with one or more rooms added is classified as a single-family home. Townhouses, rowhouses, and duplexes are considered single-family attached housing units, as long as there is no household living above another one within the walls extending from the basement to the roof to separate the units.</p>
          <p><strong>Site Energy<a name="site_energy" id="site_energy"></a>:</strong> The Btu value of energy at the point it enters the home, sometimes referred to as &quot;delivered&quot; energy. The site value of energy is used for all fuels, including electricity. (See <a href="terminology.cfm.html#btu"><strong>Btu Conversion Factors</strong></a> and <a href="terminology.cfm.html#prim_ele"><strong>Primary Electricity</strong></a>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Solar Energy<a name="s_energy" id="s_energy"></a>:</strong> The radiant energy of the sun which can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or electricity.</p>
          <p><strong>Spa:</strong> See<strong> <a href="terminology.cfm.html#hot_tub">Hot Tub</a></strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Space Heating<a name="space_heat" id="space_heat"></a>:</strong> One of the five major end-use categories in the RECS tables and analyses. The use of energy to generate heat in housing units using space-heating equipment. The equipment could be the main or secondary space-heating equipment. It does not include the use of energy to operate appliances (such as lights, televisions, and refrigerators) that give off heat as a byproduct. (See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#end_use">End Use</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#Heat_Equip">Heating Equipment</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Space-Heating Equipment:</strong> See <a href="terminology.cfm.html#Heat_Equip"><strong>Heating Equipment</strong></a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Split System:</strong> When applied to electric air-conditioning equipment, it means a two-part system—an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. The indoor unit is an evaporator coil mounted in the indoor-circulating air system, and the outdoor unit is an air-cooled condensing unit containing an electric motor-driven compressor, a condenser fan and a fan motor.</p>
          <p><strong>Square Feet:</strong> See <strong><a href="terminology.cfm.html#floorspace">Floorspace</a></strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Standard Price:</strong> Average price data were obtained from other EIA surveys and used in the end- use regression equations for natural gas and electricity. These average prices were attached to each RECS household that used the respective fuel.</p>
          <p><strong>Steam or Hot-Water System<a name="shw_system" id="shw_system"></a>:</strong> Either of two types of a central space-heating system that supplies steam or hot water to radiators, convectors, or pipes. The more common type supplies either steam or hot water to conventional radiators, baseboard radiators, convectors, heating pipes embedded in the walls or ceilings, or heating coils or equipment that are part of a combined heating/ventilating or heating/air-conditioning system. The other type supplies radiant heat through pipes that carry hot water and are held in a concrete slab floor.</p>
