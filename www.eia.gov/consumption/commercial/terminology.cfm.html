    <p><strong>Account Classification:</strong> The method in which suppliers of electricity, natural gas, or fuel oil classify and bill their customers. Commonly used account classifications are &ldquo;Commercial,&rdquo; &ldquo;Industrial,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Residential.&rdquo; Suppliers&rsquo; definitions of these terms vary from supplier to supplier and from the definitions used in CBECS. In addition, the same customer may be classified differently by each of its energy suppliers. </p>
    <p> <strong>Activities with Large Amounts of Hot Water:</strong> An energy-related space function within a building that requires large amounts of hot water for other than space heating. Examples of these activities are commercial dishwashers, laundry rooms, heated swimming pools, spas, saunas, showers and steam rooms. </p>
    <p> <span class="report_bold">Air Conditioning:  See Cooling.</span> &nbsp;</p>
    <p> <strong>Air-Handling Unit:</strong> A type of heating and/or cooling distribution equipment that channels warm or cool air to different parts of a building. This process of channeling the conditioned air often involves drawing air over heating or cooling coils and forcing it from a central location through ducts or air-handling units. Air-handling units are hidden in the walls or ceilings, where they use steam or hot water to heat, or chilled water to cool the air inside the ductwork. </p>
    <p><strong>Air Source Heat Pump:</strong> A type of heat pump that extracts heat from the outside air and brings it inside the building. Most heat pumps in use today are air source. (See Heat Pump.) </p>
    <p><strong>Authorization Form:</strong> A form signed by the building respondent, authorizing energy suppliers that serve the building to release information on the amounts and costs of energy consumed in the building and the participation by the building in Demand-Side Management programs during a specified period. (See Energy Supplier.) </p>
    <p> <a name="B"></a><strong>Barrel:</strong> A volumetric unit of measure for crude oil and petroleum products equivalent to 42 U.S. gallons.</p>
    <p> <strong>Boiler:</strong> A type of space-heating equipment consisting of a vessel or tank where heat produced from the combustion of such fuels as natural gas, fuel oil, or coal is used to generate hot water or steam. Many buildings have their own boilers, while other buildings have steam or hot water piped in from a central plant. For this survey, only boilers inside the building (or serving only that particular building) are counted as part of the building&rsquo;s heating system. Steam or hot water piped into a building from a central plant is considered district heat. </p>
    <p> <strong>Bottled Gas, LPG, or Propane:</strong> Any fuel gas supplied in liquid form, such as liquefied petroleum gas, propane or butane. It is usually delivered by tank truck and stored near the building in a tank or cylinder until used.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <strong>Brick, Stone, or Stucco:</strong> Nonstructural materials typically used on the exterior of a wood or metal frame building.</p>
    <p> <strong>Broker:</strong> An entity that arranges the sale and purchase of electric or natural gas energy, transmission and other services between electricity or natural gas buyers and the electricity or natural gas sellers.</p>
    <p> <strong>Btu (British Thermal Unit):</strong> A unit of energy consumed by or delivered to a building. A Btu is defined as the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of 1 pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit, at normal atmospheric pressure. Energy consumption is expressed in Btu to allow for consumption comparisons among fuels that are measured in different units. (See Btu Conversion Factors and Metric Conversion Factors.) </p>
    <p> <strong>Btu Conversion Factors:</strong> The Btu conversion factors used for for the CBECS are  shown in the following table. Only the Natural gas factor differed between the 199 and 2003 surveys.

    <p> <strong>Building:</strong> A structure totally enclosed by walls extending from the foundation to the roof, containing over 1,000 square feet of floorspace and intended for human occupancy. Included in the survey as a specific exception were structures erected on pillars to elevate the first fully enclosed level but leaving the sides at ground level open. Excluded from the survey as nonbuildings were the following: structures (other than the exception just noted) that were not totally enclosed by walls and a roof (such as oil refineries, steel mills, and water towers), street lights, pumps, billboards, bridges, swimming pools, oil storage tanks, construction sites, and mobile homes and trailers, even if they housed commercial activity. Since 1995, the CBECS has excluded enclosed parking garages and commercial buildings on manufacturing sites. These buildings were included in previous CBECS. (See  Commercial Building.) </p>

      <P><strong>Central Chiller:</strong> A type of cooling equipment that is centrally located and that produces chilled water in order to cool air. The chilled water or cold air is then distributed throughout the building by use of pipes or air ducts, or both. These systems are also commonly known as &ldquo;chillers,&rdquo; &ldquo;centrifugal chillers,&rdquo; &ldquo;reciprocating chillers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;absorption chillers.&rdquo; Chillers are generally located in, or just outside, the building they serve. Chillers located at central plants are included in &#8220;District Chilled Water&#8221; under &#8220;Cooling Equipment.&#8221; </P>
      <p><strong>Central Physical Plant:</strong> A plant that is owned by, and on the grounds of, a multibuilding facility that provides district heating, district cooling, or electricity to one or more buildings on the same facility. The central physical plant may be by itself in a separate building or may be located in a building where other activities occur. (See Multibuilding Facility, District Heat, or District Chilled Water.) </p>
      <p><strong>Centralized Water-Heating System:</strong> A type of water-heating equipment that heats and stores water (for purposes other than space heating) in tanks and then distributes this heated water throughout the building. A residential-type tank water heater is an example of a centralized water heater. </p>
      <p><strong>Climate Region:</strong> Starting with the 2012 CBECS, buildings are classified according to climate regions created by the Building America program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). Building America defines eight climate regions which are collapsed into five regions for the purposes of CBECS: Very cold/Cold, Mixed-humid, Mixed-dry/Hot-dry, Hot-humid, and Marine.</p>
      <p><strong>Climate Zone:</strong> One of five climatically distinct areas, defined by long-term weather conditions which affect the heating and cooling loads in buildings. The zones were determined according to a  historical average of the annual heating and cooling degree-days (base 65 degrees  Fahrenheit). Prior to the 2003 CBECS, the climate zones were based on a 45-year  average (1931-1975); beginning with the 2003 CBECS, the climate zones are based  on a 30-year average (1971-2000).  An individual building was assigned to a climate zone according to the historical average annual degree-days for its National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Division. (See Heating Degree-Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree-Days (CDD).) The climate zones are defined below: </p>

      </div>
      <p><strong>Coal:</strong> A black or brownish-black solid, combustible substance formed by the partial decomposition of vegetable matter without access to air. The term includes anthracite, bituminous, and sub bituminous coal, as well as coke, the derivative of coal formed by destructive distillation or imperfect combustion. Data on the use of coal were collected but no consumption and expenditure data were collected. Coal is included in the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; category for &ldquo;Energy Sources,&rdquo; &ldquo;Space-Heating Energy Sources,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Primary Space-Heating Energy Sources.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><strong>Cogeneration:</strong> The simultaneous production of electric and thermal energy in on-site, distributed energy systems; typically, waste heat from the electricity generation process is recovered and used to heat, cool, or dehumidify building space. Neither generation of electricity without use of the byproduct heat, nor waste-heat recovery from processes other than electricity generation is included in the definition of cogeneration. (See Electricity Generation.) </p>
      <p><strong>Commercial:</strong> In the CBECS, commercial refers to any building that is neither residential (used as a dwelling for one or more households), manufacturing/industrial (used for processing or procurement of goods, merchandise raw materials or food), nor agricultural (used for the production, processing, sale, storage, or housing of agricultural products, including livestock). At least 50 percent of the floorspace must be used for purposes other than these for a building to be considered &#8220;commercial.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>Commercial Building:</strong> A building with more than 50 percent of its floorspace used for commercial activities. Commercial buildings include, but are not limited to, the following: stores, offices, schools, churches, gymnasiums, libraries, museums, hospitals, clinics, warehouses, and jails. Government buildings were included except for buildings on sites with restricted access, such as some military bases. Agricultural buildings, residences, and manufacturing/industrial buildings are excluded. Since 1995, parking garages and commercial buildings on manufacturing sites have also been excluded. For a list of building types, see <a href="building-type-definitions.cfm.html">&ldquo;Description of types of buildings.&rdquo;</a> ( See  Building , Commercial, and  Principal Building Activity .) </p>
      <p><strong>Commercial Food Preparation:</strong> An energy-related function that has space specifically designed and equipped to meet the needs for preparing and serving food commercially. This includes kitchens in restaurants, diners, and other commercial institutions, such as schools. The term &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; also includes what is sometimes classified as &ldquo;institutional&rdquo;&mdash;that is, food preparation and serving areas in schools, hospitals, prisons, shelters, churches, and nursing homes. This category includes cafeterias where food is brought in and kept warm with steam tables or other warming devices until it is served. It does not include employee or student &ldquo;lounge&rdquo; areas with microwaves or other food preparation equipment and/or vending machines. </p>
      <p> <strong>Commercial Refrigeration:</strong> Refrigeration equipment is designed to maintain the stored items below room temperature but above the freezing point of water. This category also includes freezer equipment, which is designed to keep its contents below the freezing point of water (32 degrees Fahrenheit). In the 2003 CBECS tables, the &ldquo;commercial refrigeration&rdquo; category includes only open, closed, or walk-in commercial refrigeration or freezer units for the sale or storage of perishable materials so that it may be compared with previous CBECS, which did not collect data on residential-type refrigeration units or vending machines. (See Cases or&nbsp; Cabinets, Refrigeration Equipment, Residential-Type Refrigeration Unit, Vending Machine, and Walk-in Refrigeration Unit.) </p>
      <p><strong>Compact Fluorescent Light Bulb:</strong> A light bulb designed to replace screw-in incandescent light bulbs; they are often found in table lamps, wall sconces, and hall and ceiling fixtures of commercial buildings with residential type lights. They combine the efficiency of fluorescent lighting with the convenience of standard incandescent bulbs. Light is produced the same way as other fluorescent lamps. Compact fluorescent bulbs have either electronic or magnetic ballasts. </p>
      <p><strong>Concrete (Block or Poured):</strong> &ldquo;Concrete block&rdquo; is more than just square cinder block; it comes in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. &ldquo;Above grade poured concrete&rdquo; is formed and poured in place; it may also be referred to as &ldquo;ICF (insulated concrete form) walls.&rdquo; It is very expensive and rarely used in commercial buildings. </p>
      <p><strong>Concrete Panels:</strong> A wall construction material usually made in a factory and delivered to the construction site, where it is hoisted onto the structure, although sometimes they are poured at the site and then hoisted on the structure.

      <p><b>Ground Source Heat Pump:</b> A type of heat pump that uses the natural heat storage ability of the earth and/or the groundwater to heat and/or cool a building. The earth has the ability to absorb and store heat energy from the sun. To use that stored energy, heat is extracted from the earth through a liquid medium (groundwater or an anti-freeze solution) and is pumped to the heat pump or heat exchanger. There, the heat is used to heat the building. In the summer, the process is reversed and indoor heat is extracted from the building and transferred to the earth through the liquid. The geothermal heat pump is more efficient than an air-source heat pump. Also referred to as a &#8220;closed-loop&#8221; system.</p>
      <p><b><a name="H"></a>Halogen Light Bulb:</b> A type of incandescent light bulb that lasts much longer and is more efficient than a standard incandescent light bulb. The light bulb uses a halogen gas, usually iodine or bromine, that causes the evaporating tungsten to be redeposited on the filament, thus prolonging its life.

The median is different from the mean in that the median is not influenced much by extremes in the sample. An estimate of the mean square feet per building would be affected by the inclusion of some very large buildings and would not express square footage for a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; building. In contrast, the median square feet would not be so affected. For example, &ldquo;Median Age of the Building&rdquo; is the middle age of all CBECS buildings; &ldquo;Median Hours per Week&rdquo; is the middle number of operating hours of all CBECS buildings; &ldquo;Median Square Feet per Building&rdquo; is the middle size (in square feet) of all CBECS buildings; and &ldquo;Median Square Feet per Worker&rdquo; is the middle amount of the floorspace per worker of all CBECS buildings.</P>
