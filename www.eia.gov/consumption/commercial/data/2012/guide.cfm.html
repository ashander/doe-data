<p>The Detailed  Tables for the 2012 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) consist  of building characteristics tables (B1-B46), which contain the number of  buildings and amount of floorspace for structural and energy-related characteristics  of buildings, and consumption and expenditures tables, which contain total  energy usage data by the major energy sources (C1-C38) and end-use energy  consumption estimates (E1-E11). For more information about the end-use estimates  see <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/estimation-enduse-consumption.cfm">Estimation  of Energy End-Use Consumption</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="column" id="column"></a>Column categories</h2>
<p>The column  categories in the building characteristics tables mostly provide counts of  number of buildings or total floorspace by various building characteristics  (with the exception of Tables B1 and B2, which also include means, medians, and  ratios). For example, in Table B3, the number in the <em>All buildings</em> row, in the column labeled <em>Northeast</em> under the heading <em>Number  of buildings (thousand)</em> tells us that there were an estimated 805,000  buildings in the Northeast Census region in 2012. This same column under the  heading <em>Total floorspace (million square  feet)</em> tells us that these buildings comprised about 15,534,000,000 square  feet of total floorspace.</p>
<p>The column  categories in the energy consumption and expenditures tables provide various  measures of energy use. The following terms, listed in alphabetical order, are  explanations of some of these columns that may require clarification:</p>
<p>Conditional energy  intensity&#8212;The amount of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, or district heat  used per square foot only in buildings using the specified energy source. For  example, in Table C15, data in the row labeled <em>Education</em> within the <em>Principal  building activity</em> row category and in the column labeled <em>Northeast</em> under <em>Electricity energy intensity</em> should be interpreted: &quot;In 2012,  education buildings in the Northeast that used electricity as an energy source  used an average of 8.7 kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity per square  foot.&quot;</p>
<p>Distribution of  building-level intensities&#8212;The amount of energy used per square foot, divided  into three percentiles: 25th, median (50th), and 75th. In Table C14, for  example, the row labeled <em>Over 500,000</em> within the <em>Building floorspace</em> row category  and in the column labeled <em>25th percentile</em> under <em>Distribution of building-level intensities</em> should be interpreted: &quot;In 2012, 25 percent of commercial buildings in the  United States that were larger than 500,000 square feet used 10.1 kWh per  square foot or less, and 75 percent of these buildings used more than 10.1 kWh  of electricity per square foot.&quot;</p>
<p>Electricity&#8212;In  CBECS tables, <em>electricity</em> refers to <u>site</u> electricity. (See <em>Site electricity</em> and <em>Primary electricity</em> on this page.)</p>
<p>Energy intensity&#8212;Usually  defined as <em>gross energy intensity</em> or <em>conditional energy intensity</em> in title of  table. If table title does not specify, <em>energy  intensity</em> should be interpreted as conditional energy intensity.</p>
<p>Floorspace&#8212;The  enclosed area in a building; the sum of the floorspace in all buildings in a  category.</p>
<p>  Gross energy intensity&#8212;The  ratio of the total amount of energy consumed by a group of buildings to the  total floorspace of those buildings, including buildings and floorspace where  the energy source is not used. For example, in Table C5, data in the row  category <em>Education</em> within the <em>Principal building activity</em> row category  and in the column labeled <em>Northeast</em> under <em>Energy intensity for sum of major fuels</em> should be interpreted: &quot;In 2012, education buildings in the Northeast  consumed an average of 82.1 thousand Btu per square foot.&quot;</p>
<p>  Major fuel&#8212;Major  energy sources: electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat (district  steam or district hot water). Although electricity is technically not a fuel, <em>Major fuel</em>, rather than <em>Major energy source</em>, was retained as the  title of this category to facilitate comparison of previous CBECS data.</p>
<p>  Primary electricity&#8212;Site  electricity plus the losses associated with the generation, transmission, and  distribution of the electricity. Most of the tables present statistics for site  consumption alone, but Tables C1 and C13 also provide consumption statistics  for primary electricity.</p>
<p>  Site electricity&#8212;The  amount of electricity delivered to the commercial building. This amount  excludes losses associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution  of the electricity. (See <em>primary  electricity</em> on this page.) Most of the tables in the CBECS provide  statistics for site electricity (not for primary electricity). When the term <em>electricity</em> is used alone, the reference  is to site electricity.</p>
Sum of major fuels—The total of site  electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat. Statistics in this  column exclude data from the column <em>Primary  electricity</em>.
<p>
<h2><a name="row" id="row"></a>Row categories </h2>
<p>The row  categories classify data by specific features, such as principal building  activity or energy sources used. Some of these categories are followed by the  phrase <em>more than one may apply</em>,  indicating overlapping categories. In such row categories, a particular  building may be represented in more than one row; for example, in the <em>Energy sources</em> row category, a building that  uses both electricity and natural gas would be included in both the <em>Electricity</em> and <em>Natural gas</em> rows. In general, row categories <em>without</em> this designation are <em>mutually  exclusive</em>, that is, they divide the population of buildings into distinct  groups, so that a particular building is represented in no more than one line  within the row category.</p>
 <p> Any line within  a row category that is indented should be interpreted as being a subset of the  preceding line. For example, in the row category <em>Principal building activity</em>, there are two indented lines under <em>Health care; Inpatient</em> and <em>Outpatient</em> are both subsets of the <em>Health care</em> category. The sum of  indented items will equal the main item except in row categories labeled as <em>more than one may apply</em>.</p>
 <p>Following are descriptions  of some of the row categories found in the tables that may require  clarification or that may need explanation of changes in definition since the  2003 CBECS. These terms are listed in the order in which they occur in the  tables. Definitions of most terms found in the Detailed Tables can also be  found in <a href="../../terminology.cfm.html">CBECS Terminology</a>.</p>
<p><strong>All buildings</strong></strong>&#8212;The  CBECS definition of all commercial buildings includes all roofed and walled  structures whose principal activities are nonresidential, nonagricultural, and  nonindustrial and that are larger than 1,000 square feet (roughly twice the  size of a two-car garage).  </p>
<p>All of the  figures in the Detailed Tables are statistical estimates of the U.S. commercial  building population. The totals are estimated by applying sampling weights to a  probability-based sample of buildings (see <a href="../../2012-cbecs-building-sampling.cfm.html">How Were Buildings Selected for the 2012 CBECS?</a> for more information).</p>
<p>  <strong>Principal building  activity</strong>&#8212;This row  category presents a classification of the commercial activity that occupies the  most floorspace in the building. Some building types are combined in the  tables. For example, refrigerated and non-refrigerated warehouses were combined  as <em>Warehouse and storage</em> and skilled  nursing care buildings are included in the <em>Lodging</em> category. See <a href="../../building-type-definitions.cfm.html">Description of Building Types</a> for a full description of the principal building  activity categories.</p>
<p><strong>Census region  and division</strong>&#8212;These are the  geographical areas as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. See <a href="../../census-maps.cfm.html">Census Regions and Divisions  Map</a> for a map of the four Census Regions  and nine Census Divisions. </p>
<p>  <strong>Climate region</strong>&#8212;The 2012 CBECS is no longer providing the historical  HDD- and CDD-based climate zones that were used in previous survey cycles and  is instead using <a href="http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/climate-zones">climate regions created by the Building America program</a>, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s Office of  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). </p>
 <p> <strong>Ownership and  occupancy</strong>&#8212;Minor changes were  made between the 2003 and 2012 CBECS versions of the question on owner  occupancy, leading to some changes in the display of this row category:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In 2003, the  respondent was simply asked whether the building owner occupied any space in  the building, and this was reported in the tables as either <em>Owner occupied</em> or <em>Nonowner occupied</em>. </li>
  <li>In 2012, the  question was re-worded to include the phrase <em>leased to a tenant</em>, and it was asked differently depending on  whether the building was single occupant or multi-occupant (as reported in a  previous question). For single occupant buildings, the question was worded: &ldquo;Does the owner occupy the building or is it  leased to a tenant?&rdquo; For multi-occupant buildings: &ldquo;Is the space in this  building occupied by the owner, leased to tenants, or a combination of both?&rdquo; These  response options are reported in the tables as <em>Owner occupied</em>, <em>Leased to  tenant(s)</em>, or <em>Owner occupied and  leased</em>.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Predominant  roof material</strong>&#8212;The order of  the list of roof materials has been rearranged slightly since the 2003 CBECS  and three of the descriptions were reworded, but the survey question itself  remained unchanged between the 2003 and the 2012 CBECS. The re-worded  descriptions are: <em>Slate or tile</em> is  now <em>Slate or tile shingles</em>; <em>Wooden materials</em> is now <em>Wooden materials (including shingles)</em>;  and <em>Shingles (Not Wood)</em> is now <em>Asphalt, fiberglass, or other shingles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Roof characteristics</strong>&#8212;This row category is new to the 2012 CBECS and combines  information from two new survey questions about roof tilt and cool roofs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Roof tilt</em> was collected  by asking the respondent to choose the tilt or pitch of the roof from  illustrations on a show card. <em>Shallow  pitch</em> was also described as <em>3 in 12  or less; 14&deg; or less</em> and <em>steeper  pitch</em> as <em>more than 3 in 12; more than  14&deg;</em>.</li>
  <li>The <em>cool roof</em> question was phrased: &ldquo;Is the roof of this building designed to reduce solar  heat gain, also known as a &lsquo;cool roof&rsquo;?&rdquo; The following explanation was also  provided: &ldquo;Roofs with a highly reflective surface, a ballasted roof system, a  vegetated roof system, or any combination of these technologies should be  considered a &lsquo;cool roof&rsquo;.&rdquo; </li>  </ul>
<p><strong>Renovations in buildings  constructed before 2008</strong>&#8212;In the 2003  CBECS, this row category was called <em>Renovations  in Buildings Constructed Before 1980</em>. The 2012 version of this question  underwent a number of changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the 2012 CBECS, instead of being limited to buildings  constructed before 1980, the renovation question was asked of all except the  newest buildings (the question was skipped for buildings constructed from 2008  to 2012). For buildings constructed in 1990 or later, it was worded: &ldquo;Has  any portion of this building undergone renovations since it was constructed?&rdquo;  and for buildings constructed before 1990: &ldquo;Has any portion of this building undergone  renovations since 1990?&rdquo;
  </li>
  <li>The word <em>major</em> was removed from the question, i.e. the 2003 CBECS asked about <em>major renovations</em> while the 2012 CBECS  just asked about <em>renovations</em>. In  2012, within the follow-up list of types of renovations, one option was <em>Interior or exterior cosmetic improvements</em>.  Buildings that chose only this type of renovation were re-coded in the Detailed  Tables as <em>No renovations</em>.
  </li>
  <li>Three specific renovation types were added to the  follow-up question and to the table row category: <em>Electrical upgrade</em>; <em>Fire,  safety, or security upgrade</em>; and <em>Structural  upgrade</em> (foundation or seismic upgrade).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy sources</strong>&#8212;This row category tabulates buildings using each of the  following energy sources for any purpose during the reference year: electricity,  natural gas, fuel oil, district heat (district steam or district hot water),  district chilled water, propane, wood, coal, solar, and other. In Tables B1 and  B2, wood, coal, and solar are reported separately, but in the rest of the  tables they are combined into the <em>Other</em> category. </p>
<p>In the building  characteristics tables, this row indicates the number of buildings or amount of  floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for any purpose. For  example, in Table B11 (Selected principal building activity), the figure in the <em>Office</em> column and the <em>Natural gas</em> row should be interpreted:  &quot;600,000 office buildings used natural gas for some purpose in 2012.&quot;  As another example, in Table B38 (Heating equipment), the figure in the column <em>Furnaces</em> and the row <em>Natural gas </em>should be interpreted:  &quot;550,000 buildings have a furnace and also use natural gas for some  purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>In the  consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates total consumption in  buildings that use each energy source for any purpose. For example, in Table C4,  the figure in the column <em>Sum of major  fuel consumption per square foot</em> and the row <em>Fuel oil</em> should be interpreted: &quot;Buildings that used fuel oil  for any purpose consumed an average 110,500 Btu of combined electricity,  natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat per square foot in 2012.&quot; (It  should NOT be interpreted as the consumption specifically of fuel oil.)</p>
<p> <strong>Space-heating energy  sources</strong>&#8212;This row  category tabulates buildings using each of the following energy sources for main  or secondary space heating during the reference year: electricity, natural gas,  fuel oil, district heat (district steam or district hot water), propane, wood,  coal, solar, and other. In Tables B1 and B2, wood, coal, and solar are reported  separately, but in the rest of the tables they are combined into the <em>Other</em> category. In the building  characteristics tables, this row indicates the number of buildings or  floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for main or secondary space  heating.</p>
<p>For example, in Table B38 (Heating equipment), the figure in the column Heat pumps and the row Natural gas should be interpreted: &quot;188,000 buildings have a heat pump and also use natural gas as an energy source for space heating.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted as the number of buildings that use natural gas to power a heat pump. It is possible that they also use electricity for space heating, and that electricity is the energy source used for the heat pump.) In the consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates total consumption in buildings that use each energy source for space heating. For example, in Table C23, the figure in the column Natural gas consumption and the row Natural Gas should be interpreted: &quot;1,923 billion cubic feet of natural gas were used in buildings that use natural gas for space heating.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted as the consumption of natural gas specifically for space heating; that figure is found in either Table E7 or E8.) </p>
 <p><strong>Primary space-heating  energy source</strong>&#8212;This row  category tabulates buildings using each of the following energy sources for main  or secondary space heating during the reference year: electricity, natural gas,  fuel oil, district heat (district steam or district hot water), propane, wood, coal,  solar, and other. In Tables B1 and B2, wood, coal, and solar are reported  separately, but in the rest of the tables they are combined into the <em>Other</em> category. In the building  characteristics tables, this row indicates the number of buildings or  floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for main or secondary space  heating. For example, in Table B38 (Heating equipment), the figure in the  column <em>Heat pumps</em> and the row <em>Natural gas</em> should be interpreted:  &quot;188,000 buildings have a heat pump and also use natural gas as an energy  source for space heating.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted as the number of  buildings that use natural gas to power a heat pump. It is possible that they  also use electricity for space heating, and that electricity is the energy  source used for the heat pump.)</p>
 <p>   In the  consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates total consumption in  buildings that use each energy source for space heating. For example, in Table  C23, the figure in the column <em>Natural gas  consumption</em> and the row <em>Natural Gas</em> should be interpreted: &quot;1,923 billion cubic feet of natural gas were used  in buildings that use natural gas for space heating.&quot; (It should NOT be  interpreted as the consumption of natural gas specifically for space heating;  that figure is found in either Table E7 or E8.)</p>
<p>  <strong>Cooling energy source</strong>&#8212;This row  category tabulates buildings using each of the following energy sources for cooling  the building during the reference year: electricity, natural gas, and district  chilled water. In the building characteristics tables, this row indicates the  number of buildings or floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for  cooling. For example, in Table B40 (Cooling equipment), the figure in the  column <em>Central chillers</em> and the row <em>Electricity</em> should be interpreted:  &quot;162,000 buildings have a central chiller for cooling and also use electricity  for cooling.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted as the number of buildings  that use electricity to power a central chiller. It is possible that the central  chiller is powered by natural gas while the electricity is used to run a heat  pump for cooling, for example.)</p>
<p>  In the  consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates total consumption in  buildings that use each energy source for cooling. For example, in Table C13,  the figure in the column <em>Site electricity  consumption</em> and the row <em>Electricity</em> should be interpreted: &quot;1,159 billion kWh of total electricity were used  in buildings that use electricity as a cooling energy source.&quot; (It should  NOT be interpreted as the consumption of electricity specifically for cooling;  that figure is found in Table E3 or E5.)</p>
<p><strong>Water-heating energy  source</strong>&#8212;This row  category tabulates buildings using each of the following energy sources for water  heating in the building during the reference year: electricity, natural gas,  fuel oil, district heat (district steam or district hot water), and propane. In  the building characteristics tables, this row indicates the number of buildings  or floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for water heating.</p>
 <p> In the  consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates total consumption in  buildings that use each energy source for water heating. For example, in Table  C23, the figure in the column <em>Natural gas  consumption</em> and the row <em>Natural gas</em> should be interpreted: &quot;1,728 billion cubic feet of natural gas were used  in buildings that use natural gas for water heating.&quot; (It should NOT be  interpreted as the consumption of natural gas specifically for water heating;  that figure is found in Table E7 or E8.)</p>
<p>  <strong>Cooking energy source</strong>&#8212;This row  category tabulates buildings using each of the following energy sources for cooking  in the building during the reference year: electricity, natural gas, and  propane.  In the building characteristics  tables, this row indicates the number of buildings or floorspace in buildings  that use each energy source for cooking.</p>
<p>  In the  consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates total consumption in  buildings that use each energy source for cooking. For example, in Table C13,  the figure in the column <em>Site electricity  consumption</em> and the row <em>Electricity</em> should be interpreted: &quot;454 billion kWh of electricity were used in  buildings that use electricity for cooking.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted  as the consumption of electricity specifically for cooking; that figure is  found in Table E3 or E5.)</p>
<p><strong>Energy end uses</strong>&#8212;This row  category tabulates buildings in which some energy was used for the specific end  uses (heating, air-conditioning, water heating, cooking, and manufacturing) in  the building during the reference year. For example, in Table B6 (Building  size), the figure in the <em>1,001 to 5,000  square feet column </em>and the <em>Buildings  with cooking</em> row should be interpreted: &ldquo;673,000 buildings between the  sizes of 1,001 and 5,000 square feet used some energy for cooking in 2012.&rdquo; For  another example, in Table C1, data in the <em>Buildings  with cooling </em>row and in the <em>Sum of  major fuels</em> column should interpreted: &quot;Buildings with cooling  consumed a total of 6,774 trillion Btu of the major fuels.&quot; It should NOT  be interpreted as the amount of energy specifically used for cooling; that  figure is found in Table E1. <strong></strong></p>
<p>     <strong>Percent lit during off hours</strong>&#8212;In the 2003 CBECS, this row category was called <em>Percent Lit When Closed</em>. The question  sequence was modified for the 2012 CBECS, which resulted in a change to the row  category:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>In the 2003 CBECS, buildings that were always open were  not asked what percent of the building was lit during off hours, assuming that because  they were open all the time, the lighting would never be reduced. 
     </li>
     <li>In the 2012  CBECS, however, it was not assumed that lighting was never reduced in buildings  that were always open. Instead, for buildings open all the time, this question  was asked: &ldquo;Are there any  periods during a normal 24-hour day when some of the lights are turned off?&rdquo; If  the response was &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the question about percent lit during off hours was  asked, just as it was for buildings that were sometimes closed. In the modified  row category, there is a row for buildings that are always open with no off  hours (i.e. the respondent reported that there weren&rsquo;t any periods during a  normal 24-hour day when some lights are turned off) and a separate row for  buildings that don&rsquo;t use electricity (and were therefore also not asked the  percent lit questions).</li>  </ul>
   <p><strong>Heating equipment</strong>&#8212;A comparison of the types of heating equipment reported  between 2003 and 2012 reveals some notable differences. For example, there were  fewer furnaces and more packaged heating units reported in 2012 than in the  2003 CBECS. These changes are substantial, and are likely due to questionnaire  changes rather than to actual changes in the types of equipment being used in  buildings. The 2003 CBECS simply asked the respondent to choose from the list  of seven heating equipment types; these responses were coded in the data as  they were reported. No additional clarification was requested. The 2012 CBECS,  however, used a series of follow-up questions which resulted in  reclassification of some of the heating equipment types. Specifically:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>When a furnace was reported, the respondent was asked if  it was a (1) <em>packaged central unit (roof  mounted)</em>, (2) <em>split system  (residential-type furnace with DX cooling unit)</em>, (3) <em>duct furnace</em>, or (4) <em>an  individual room furnace (freestanding or floor-mounted)</em>. The only one of  these furnace types that was retained as a furnace in the data file was (2) <em>split system</em>. Responses (1) <em>packaged central unit</em> and (3) <em>duct furnace</em> were classified as packaged  units and response (4) <em>individual room  furnace</em> was classified as an individual space heater. The respondent was  informed that for the purposes of the study, their equipment was going to be  referred to as something other than a furnace.</li> 
     <li>When an <em>other</em> type of heating equipment was reported, the respondent was asked if it included  any of these components: (1) <em>heating coil  or electric heat strip</em>, (2) <em>duct  reheat or electric reheat</em>, (3) <em>powered  induction units (PIU)</em>, or (4) <em>none of  these components</em>. </li>
   </ul>
<p>If responses (1), (2), or (3) were provided, the treatment of the <em>other</em> equipment depended on what heating  equipment had already been reported:</p>
        <ul>
       <ul>
         <li>If the  respondent had already reported a packaged unit, the <em>other</em> equipment was removed because it was considered to be part of  the packaged unit.</li>
         <li>If the  respondent had already reported a boiler or district heating, the <em>other</em> equipment was removed because it  was considered to be part of of the boiler or the district heating system. </li>
         <li>If neither  packaged units or boilers or district heating had been previously reported, the <em>other </em>equipment was removed and a  packaged unit was added as the heating equipment. </li>
       </ul></ul>

   <p>If the  respondent answered (4) <em>none of these  components</em>, they were asked to describe the other type of heating system. The  interviewer entered the response verbatim. EIA reviewed all these responses and  recoded as appropriate when the description matched one of the listed equipment  types. If the heating equipment description did not fit into one of the listed  categories, the response was retained as <em>other</em> heating equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting equipment types</strong>&#8212;A category for <em>light  emitting diode (LED)</em> bulbs was added for the 2012 CBECS.</p>

<p><strong>Refrigeration equipment</strong>&#8212;Some slight changes were made in tabulation between 2003  and 2012:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 2003 CBECS  included a row for <em>Commercial  Refrigeration</em> in order to be comparable to the 1999 CBECS <em>Any Equipment</em> row, since the 1999 CBECS  didn&rsquo;t ask about any residential-type refrigeration equipment. 
  </li>

<li>The 2012 CBECS does <em>not</em> include a row comparable to the 1999 CBECS <em>Any Equipment</em> row; the <em>Any  refrigeration</em> row now includes all buildings with any type of refrigeration  equipment, whether residential- or commercial-type. Information about the types  of refrigeration equipment collected has been expanded since 2003: the 2012
CBECS also  collected information about large cold storage areas, commercial ice makers,  and compact or half-size refrigerators. Although the presence and number of compact  or half-size refrigerators were collected separately in the survey, they are  combined with full-size residential refrigerators in the table row <em>Residential-type or compact units</em>.</li></ul>
   <p><strong>Office equipment</strong>&#8212;For the first time, the 2012 CBECS differentiated  between desktop computers and laptop computers. Therefore, while the 2003 CBECS  office equipment row category has just one row for <em>Computers,</em> the 2012 CBECS version splits this information into two  rows: one row for <em>Desktop computers </em>and  one row for <em>Laptop computers</em>. These  rows should be interpreted as the number of buildings that have at least one  desktop computer (3,977,000 total buildings) and the number that have at least  one laptop computer (2,730,000 total buildings). There are two additional items  of information about desktop computers in the 2012 tables: the number of  buildings with at least one computer with a flat screen monitor (3,847,000 total  buildings) and the number of buildings where at least one of the computers has  multiple monitors (911,000 total buildings)</p>
<p><strong>Food  preparation or serving areas in non-food service buildings</strong>&#8212;In the 2003 CBECS, <em>Commercial  Food Preparation </em>was a single row within a row category called <em>Energy-Related Space Functions</em>. Instead  of a single summary line, the 2012 CBECS tables provide a breakdown of the  different types of food preparation areas (<em>Snack  bar or concession stand</em>, <em>Fast food or  small restaurant</em>, <em>Cafeteria or large  restaurant</em>, <em>Commercial kitchen/food  preparation are</em>a, and <em>Small kitchen  area</em>). To preclude redundancy, buildings with a principal building activity  of food service were not asked whether they had any space for food preparation  or serving, so they are not included in these counts. If the building  respondent did not report cooking as an end use in the building, they were not  asked about these space types.</p>
<p><strong>Separate computer areas</strong>&#8212;In the 2003 CBECS, <em>Separate  Computer Area</em> was a single row within a row category called <em>Energy-Related Space Functions</em>. Instead  of a single summary line, the 2012 CBECS tables provide a breakdown of some of  the different types of separate computer areas (<em>Data center or server farm</em>, <em>Computer-based  training room</em>, and <em>Student or public  computer center</em>). The 2012 CBECS also asked about trading floors as a  separate computer area but there were not enough reported to tabulate.</p>
<p><strong>HVAC  conservation features</strong>&#8212;The row that is  labeled <em>Building automation system (BAS)</em> in the 2012 CBECS was named <em>Energy Management and Control System (EMCS) </em>in  the 2003 CBECS. These terms are synonymous for the purposes of the CBECS; EMCS  is still mentioned in the 2012 question text: &ldquo;Does this building have a  &lsquo;Building Automation System&rsquo; which may also be referred to as BAS, smart building controls, an energy management and  control system, or EMCS?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The estimated number of buildings with an EMCS or BAS has  grown substantially since the 2003 CBECS; this growth should be partially  attributed to the skip patterns in the survey instrument: </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the 2003  CBECS, respondents did not have the opportunity to report an EMCS unless they  answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to a question asking if they changed the temperature settings  for heating or cooling during off hours. At that point, they were asked how  they changed the temperature settings, and one of the response options was  EMCS.</li>
  <li> In the  2012 CBECS, all buildings with heating or cooling were asked the BAS question.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Window and interior  lighting features</strong>&#8212;There  are five lighting features in this row category that were new questionnaire  items for the CBECS (<em>Light scheduling</em>, <em>Occupancy sensors</em>, <em>Multi-level lighting or dimming</em>, <em>Daylight harvesting</em>, and <em>Demand responsive lighting</em>). Definitions  of these lighting features can be found in <a href="../../terminology.cfm.html">CBECS Terminology</a>.</p>
<p>A similar issue exists for the <em>Building  automation system (BAS) for lighting</em> row as was described above in <em>HVAC features</em>:
<ul>
  <li>In the 2003  CBECS, respondents did not have a chance to report an EMCS unless they answered  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to a question asking if they changed the temperature settings for heating  or cooling during off hours. At that point, they were asked how they changed  the temperature settings, and one of the response options was EMCS. Then, only  buildings that chose EMCS as a response in the heating and/or cooling section  were later asked whether the EMCS also controls the interior lighting system.
  </li> 
  <li>In the 2012  CBECS, all buildings with heating or cooling were asked the BAS question. If  they answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to that question, then later in the lighting section of the  questionnaire they were asked if the BAS also controls the interior lighting  system. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Relative Standard Errors (RSEs)</h2>
  <p>Standard error is a measure of the reliability or precision of the survey  statistic. The value for the standard error can be used to construct confidence  intervals and to perform hypothesis tests by standard statistical methods.  Relative Standard Error (RSE) is defined as the standard error (square root of  the variance) of a survey estimate, divided by the survey estimate and multiplied  by 100.
    </p>
    
  <p>Each Excel version of the Detailed Tables contains a second worksheet  labeled <em>RSE</em>, which contains the RSE  for each cell in the corresponding table. These RSEs can be used to construct  confidence intervals and test for statistical differences as described in <a href="rse.cfm.html">What is an RSE</a>?.
