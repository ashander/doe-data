        <li>Inpatient health, which used the most energy per square foot, became 
          relatively less intensive when operating hours were taken into account, 
          since hospitals are typically open around the clock.</li>
        <li> Education buildings, on the other hand, which are in use for shorter 
          periods of time, become relatively more intensive than when looking 
          just at energy use per square foot.<br>
