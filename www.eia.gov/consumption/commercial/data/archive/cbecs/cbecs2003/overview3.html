  <h2><strong>Major  Characteristics of All Commercial Buildings in 2003</strong></h2>
  <p>CBECS data are used to  answer basic questions about the commercial buildings sector, such as: What  types are there? How large are they? How old are they? and Where are they?  </p>
  <p>Results from the 2003 CBECS show that: </p>
  <ul>
      <li>The commercial  buildings sector is not dominated by a single building type.</li>
      <li>Office  buildings, the most common type of commercial building, account for 17 percent of buildings,  floorspace, and energy consumed.</li>
      <li>Commercial  buildings range widely in size and smaller buildings are much more numerous than  larger buildings.</li>
      <li>The smallest  buildings (1,001 to 5,000 square feet) account for 53 percent of buildings, but  consume only 11 percent of total energy.</li>
      <li>The largest  buildings (those larger than 500,000 square feet) constitute less than 0.2 percent of  buildings, but consume 14 percent of energy.</li>
      <li>Buildings  constructed from 1970 to 2003 comprise 58 percent of buildings, 63 percent of  floorspace, and consume 65 percent of energy.</li>
      <li>The South  Census Region, the most populous of the 4 regions, accounts for  more than one-third of buildings, floorspace, and consumption.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h3><strong><a name="pba" id="pba"></a>Principal</strong> <strong>Building Activities</strong></h3>
  <p>The commercial sector is not dominated by a  single type of building (commercial activity), unlike the residential sector  which is dominated by single-family homes. In fact, the 2003 survey identified more than 100 specific  activities. CBECS aggregates these  activities into the 14 principal building activities shown in the <a href="detailed_tables_2003/detailed_tables_2003.html">detailed tables</a> and <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/Table1.html">Table 1</a>  (the  mercantile category is shown with its mall and non-mall subcategories).</p>
  <p>Two activities, office   and mercantile: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>comprise the most floorspace (33 percent of total floorspace, Figure 7), </li>
    <li>are  the most numerous (30 percent of buildings, Figure 8), and </li>
    <li>consume the most energy (33 percent of the total, Figure 9).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Comparison of Figures 7, 8, and 9 reveals differences between activities. For example, health care buildings, which are energy intensive, consume  9 percent of total energy, but account for just 3 percent of buildings and 4 percent of total floorspace. Conversely, warehouse and storage buildings, which are not energy intensive, consume 7 percent of energy, but comprise 12 percent of buildings and 14 percent of floorspace. </p>

  <h3><strong><a name="size" id="size"></a>Size of Buildings</strong></h3>
  <p>The vast majority of commercial buildings are in the smaller  building size categories (Figure 10). More than half of  buildings were 5,000 square feet in size or smaller and nearly three-fourths are  10,000 square feet or smaller (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/Table2.html">Table 2</a>). In contrast, the amount of energy  consumed is more evenly distributed across building size categories (Figure  11). The smallest size category (1,001 to 5,000) comprises 11 percent of  consumption and the three smallest categories combined (1,001 to 25,000)  account for one-third of consumption, but these three categories account  for nearly 90 percent of buildings (Figure 12).</p>
  <p>In contrast to smaller commercial buildings, the percentage  of consumption in larger commercial buildings greatly exceeds the percentage  of buildings. For example, less than one percent of buildings are larger than  200,000 square feet in size, but these buildings consume more than  one-quarter of total energy. Only five percent of buildings are larger than  50,000 square feet in size, but these buildings account for more than 55  percent of consumption.</p>

  <p class="source">Source: Energy Information Administration, 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey.</p>
  <h3><strong><a name="year" id="year"></a>Year Constructed</strong></h3>
  <p>The 2003 CBECS aggregates buildings into the 8 &quot;Year Constructed&quot; categories shown in the <a href="detailed_tables_2003/detailed_tables_2003.html">detailed tables</a> and <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/Table3.html">Table 3</a>. Since the 2003 CBECS surveyed existing buildings, the categories reflect surviving buildings. The amount of floorspace, number of buildings, and amount of energy consumed  show a similar pattern when compared by these categories (Figures 13, 14, and 15).</p>
  <p>We can further aggregate these data into 2 categories, &quot;older buildings&quot; (those constructed before 1970) and &quot;newer buildings&quot; (those constructed from 1970 to 2003) (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/Table3.html">Table 3</a>). (The median year constructed for all commercial buildings is 1973.) About 2.8 million of the 4.9 million buildings estimated by the 2003  CBECS, or 58 percent, were constructed from 1970 to 2003. These buildings comprise 63  percent of total commercial floorspace and 65 percent of consumption.</p>
  <p>Buildings are getting larger&#8212;the mean size of commercial buildings is  greatest for the most recently constructed buildings (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/Table3.html">Table 3</a>). Buildings constructed between  1970 and 2003 have a mean size of 16,000 square feet while those constructed before  1970 have a mean size of 13,100 square feet, a difference that is statistically  significant.</p>
  <p class="figure"><strong>Figure 13. Buildings that were constructed since 1970 comprise more than 60 percent of floorspace. </strong></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong><a name="region" id="region"></a>Census Region</strong></h3>
  <p>The South Census Region, the most populous of the 4 Census Regions, has the largest percentage of  commercial buildings and commercial floorspace (more than one-third of both total buildings and floorspace, <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/Table4.html">Table 4</a> and Figures 16 and  17). The estimate of energy consumed in the South is greater than that of the  other regions (Figure 18), but it is not statistically significantly greater  than the Midwest. The Midwest  accounts for about one-fourth of commercial buildings, floorspace, and  consumption. </p>
  <p>Although buildings in the Northeast region are, on average,  several thousand square feet larger than buildings in the other regions, the  differences are not statistically significant (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/Table4.html">Table 4</a>).</p>
  <p class="figure"><strong>Figure 16. Nearly 40 percent of commercial floorspace is found in buildings in the South. </strong></p>
