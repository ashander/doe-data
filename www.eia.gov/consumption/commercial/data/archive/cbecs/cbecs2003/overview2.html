  <h2><strong>Trends  in Commercial Buildings Sector&mdash;1979 to 2003</strong></h2>
  Since the first CBECS in  1979, the commercial buildings sector has increased in size. 
  <p>From 1979 to 2003:    
    
  <ul>
      <li>The number of  commercial buildings increased from 3.8 million to 4.9 million (Figure 3).</li>
      <li>The amount of commercial  floorspace increased from 51 billion to 72 billion square feet (Figure 4).</li>
      <li>Total energy  consumed increased from less than 5,900 trillion to more than 6,500 trillion Btu (Figure 5).</li>
      <li>Electricity  and natural gas consumption, nearly equal in 1979, diverged; electricity increased to more than 3,500 trillion Btu by 2003 while natural gas declined to 2,100 trillion Btu.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because CBECS is a sample  survey, each estimate has sampling error associated with it and the statistical  significance of estimates have to be considered when comparing estimates (see <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbecs2003/statistical_detail.html">Statistical Detail</a> and  <a href="../tech_std_errors.html">Estimation of Standard Errors</a> for additional information).    </p>
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Energy  Consumption</strong></h3>
  <p>In 2003, total energy consumed by  the commercial buildings sector exceeded 6,500 trillion Btu (6,523 &plusmn; 511  trillion Btu) for the first time since EIA began collecting these data in 1979 (Figure  5). From 1979 to 1999, estimates of total consumption varied between a high of slightly more than 5,800 trillion Btu in 1979 to a low of  just under 5,000 trillion Btu in 1986. But when  the uncertainties of the  estimates are considered, the differences   are not statistically significant. With the addition  of 2003 CBECS data, we can confirm a statistically significant increase in  consumption between 1995 and 2003. (Note that energy consumption for heating and cooling are affected by the actual weather for each of the survey years.) </p>
  <p>Electricity and natural gas have been, and continue to be, the  two dominant energy sources in the commercial buildings sector. Together they  account for more than 87 percent of total energy consumed. Electricity consumption increased from just over 2,200 trillion Btu in  1979 to more than 3,500 trillion in 2003. Along with that increase in consumption,  electricity increased its share of total energy consumed from 38 percent in 1979 to  55 percent in 2003.</p>
  <p>The increase in the amount of electricity consumed is  consistent with the increased use of existing types of electrical equipment and  introduction of new types of equipment in commercial buildings. Because of the wide range of  activities in the sector, we find the adoption and increased use of equipment such as  personal computers, office equipment (servers, printers, copiers, and fax machines), telecommunications equipment, and medical diagnostic and monitoring  equipment. In addition to  electricity consumed directly by that equipment, many  of these types have cooling, humidity control, and ventilation requirements that  also increase electricity consumption.</p>
  <p class="figure"><strong>Figure 5. In the first two cycles of CBECS, consumption of electricity and natural gas  were about equal, but since 1986, electricity has exceeded natural gas. </strong></p>
  <img src="images/consumption_trend.gif" alt="Figure 5. In the first two cycles of CBECS, consumption of electricity and natural gas were about equal, but since 1986, electricity has exceeded natural gas." width="643" height="375" />
  <p class="source">Source: Energy Information Administration, Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey.</p>
  <p>The amount of natural gas consumed by commercial buildings  declined from a high in 1979 of 2,550 trillion to a low of 1,723 trillion in  1986. Since 1989, natural gas consumption has been nearly constant, at around  2,000 trillion Btu. As a percentage of total consumption, natural gas  consumption declined from 44 percent in 1979 to 32 percent in 2003. </p>
  <p>Commercial buildings consumed less than 1,000 trillion Btu  of either fuel oil or district heat across the 1979 to 2003 period. In 1979, buildings  consumed more than three times as much energy from fuel oil as district heat,  but by 2003, energy from fuel oil was less than 40 percent of district heat. </p>
  <p>While the total amount of energy consumed by commercial  buildings increased, the amount of commercial floorspace increased even more, and therefore  the  intensity of total energy use (measured in thousand Btu per square foot) declined  (Figure 6). In 1979, total energy intensity was 114 thousand Btu per square  foot of commercial floorspace, but by 1986, it had declined to 86 thousand Btu  per square foot. Since 1986, it has remained in the 81 to 92 thousand Btu  range.</p>
  <p>The energy intensities of electricity and natural gas show  contrasting trends. For the first four CBECS surveys, electricity intensity  remained in a narrow range from 42 to 45 thousand Btu per square foot. In 1992,  the electricity estimate dropped to 39 thousand and then began a steady  increase to 51 thousand in 2003 as demand for more services that use electricity increased. Natural gas intensity declined sharply from  1979 to 1986 and has remained in the 43 thousand to 52 thousand Btu per square  foot range since. </p>
