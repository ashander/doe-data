      href="2003description.html#row">Row Categories</A> </p>
          <p class="SubSection">The detailed tables for the 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) consist of building characteristics tables (A1-A8 and B1-B46), which contain the number of buildings and amount of floorspace for major building characteristics, and consumption and expenditures tables (C1-C38 and C1A-C38A), which contain energy usage data.<p> 

            <span class="SubSection">Tables A1-A8 and C1A-C38A contain basic information for all buildings including malls, whereas Tables B1-B46 and C1-C38 contain information only for non-mall buildings. <a href="mallchanges.html">Click here</a> for further explanation of the differences.</span>
          <p><span class="SubSection">

Tables B1 and B2 are summary tables. Tables B3-B21 address location, building size, year constructed, building activity, number of workers, hours of operation, and types of occupancy. Tables B22-B33 contain data about the energy sources used for all end uses and for specific major end uses. Tables B34-B46 contain data about percent of floorspace heated, cooled, and lit, and energy-using equipment types (heating, cooling, water heating, lighting, and refrigeration).</span>
          <p class="SubSection">

Tables C1-C12 and C1A-C12A contain energy usage data for the total of all major fuels (electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat). Tables C13-C22 and C13A-C22A contain electricity usage data. Tables C23-C32 and C23A-C32A contain natural gas usage data. Tables C33-C36 and C33A-C36A contain fuel oil usage data. Tables C37, C38, C37A, and C38A contain district heat usage data.

          <P align="justify" class="SubSection"><A name=column></A><span class="CategoryTitle">Column  Categories<br>
  &nbsp;</span><br>
          The column categories in the<a href="detailed_tables_2003.html#buildingchar03"> <strong>building  characteristics</strong></a> tables mainly provide counts of number of buildings or  total floorspace by various building characteristics. For example, in Table A2,  the number in the &ldquo;All Buildings&rdquo; row and in the column labeled &ldquo;Northeast&rdquo;  under the heading &ldquo;Number of Buildings (thousand)&rdquo; tells us that there were an  estimated 761,000 buildings in the Northeast Census Region in 2003. This same  column under the heading &ldquo;Total Floorspace (million square feet)&rdquo; tells us that  these buildings comprised 13,995,000,000 square feet of total floorspace. <strong> </strong></P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
          The column categories in the <a href="detailed_tables_2003.html#consumexpen03"><strong>energy consumption and expenditures</strong></a> tables provide various measures  of energy use. The following terms, listed in alphabetical order, are  explanations of some of these columns that may require clarification:</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection"><strong>Conditional Energy  Intensity</strong>&mdash;The amount of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, or district  heat used per square foot only in buildings using the specified energy source.  For example, in Table C15, data in the row labeled &ldquo;Education&rdquo; within the  &ldquo;Principal Building Activity&rdquo; row category and in the column labeled  &ldquo;Northeast&rdquo; under &ldquo;Electricity Energy Intensity&rdquo; should be interpreted: &ldquo;In 2003,  education buildings in the Northeast that used electricity as an energy source  used an average of 7.8 kilowatthours of electricity per square foot.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Distribution of Building-Level  Intensities</strong>&mdash;The amount of energy used per square foot, divided into three  percentiles: 25th, median (50th), and 75th. In Table C14, for example, the row  labeled &ldquo;Over 500,000&rdquo; within the &ldquo;Building Floorspace&rdquo; row category and in the  column labeled &ldquo;25th Percentile&rdquo; under &ldquo;Distribution of Building-Level Intensities&rdquo;  should be interpreted: &ldquo;In 2003, 25 percent of buildings in the U.S. larger  than 500,000 square feet used 10.0 kWh per square foot or less, and 75 percent  of these buildings used more than 10.0 kWh of electricity per square foot.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Electricity</strong>&mdash;Site electricity. (See  &ldquo;site electricity&rdquo; and &ldquo;primary electricity&rdquo; in this listing.) <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Energy Intensity</strong>&mdash;Usually defined as  &ldquo;gross energy intensity&rdquo; or &ldquo;conditional energy intensity&rdquo; in title of table.  If table title does not specify, &ldquo;energy intensity&rdquo; is to be defined as  &ldquo;conditional energy intensity.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Floorspace</strong>&mdash;The enclosed area in a  building; the sum of the floorspace in all buildings in a category. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Gross Energy Intensity</strong>&mdash;The ratio of  the total amount of energy consumed by a group of buildings to the total  floorspace of those buildings, including buildings and floorspace where the  energy source is not used. For example, in Table C5, data in the row category  &ldquo;Education&rdquo; within the &ldquo;Principal Building Activity&rdquo; row category and in the  column labeled &ldquo;Northeast&rdquo; under &ldquo;Energy Intensity for Sum of Major Fuels&rdquo; should  be interpreted: &ldquo;In 2003, education buildings in the Northeast consumed an  average of 101.6 thousand Btu per square foot.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Major Fuel</strong>&mdash;Major energy sources:  electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat (district steam or  district hot water). Although electricity is technically not a fuel, &ldquo;Major  Fuel,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Major Energy Source,&rdquo; was retained as the title of this  category to facilitate comparison of previous CBECS  data. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Primary Electricity</strong>&mdash;Site electricity  plus the losses associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution  of the electricity. Most of the tables present statistics for site consumption  alone, but Tables C1 and C13 also provide consumption statistics for primary  electricity. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Site Electricity</strong>&mdash;The amount of  electricity delivered to the commercial building. This amount excludes losses  associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution of the  electricity. (See &ldquo;primary electricity&rdquo; in this listing.) Most of the tables in  this section provide statistics for site electricity alone (not for primary  electricity). When just the term &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; is used, the reference is to  site electricity. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Sum of Major Fuels</strong>&mdash;The total of site  electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat. Statistics in this  column exclude data from the column &ldquo;Primary Electricity.&rdquo;
<p>
  <a name="row"></a><span class="CategoryTitle">Row  Categories </span><span class="report_bold"><br>
&nbsp;</span><br>
<span class="SubSection">The row categories classify data by specific features, such  as principal building activity or energy sources used. Some of these categories  are followed by the phrase &ldquo;more than one may apply.&rdquo; This indicates  overlapping categories, so that a particular building may be represented in  more than one line under this stub (for example, in &ldquo;Energy Sources,&rdquo; a  building can use both electricity and natural gas). In general, row stubs  without this designation are mutually exclusive&mdash;that is, they divide the  population of buildings into distinct groups, so that a particular building is  represented in no more than one line under this stub.</span></P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            Any line within a row category that is indented should be  interpreted as being a subset of the preceding line. For example, in the row  category &ldquo;Principal Building Activity,&rdquo; there are two indented lines under  &ldquo;Health Care&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Inpatient&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outpatient.&rdquo; These are both subsets of the  &ldquo;Health Care&rdquo; category. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Below are explanations of some of the row categories found in the tables that  may require clarification. These terms are listed in the order in which they  occur in the tables. Definitions of most terms found in the Detailed Tables can  also be found in the <a href="../../../../../terminology.cfm.html"><strong>Glossary</strong></a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>All Buildings</strong>&mdash;In Tables  A1 through A8, these are all roofed and walled structures whose principal  activities are nonresidential, nonagricultural, and nonindustrial and that are  larger than 1,000 square feet (roughly twice the size of a two-car garage). In  Tables B1 through B46 and C1 through C38, these are the same except they do not  include enclosed malls or strip shopping centers. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Principal Building Activity</strong>&mdash;A  classification of the activity that occupies the most floorspace in the  buildings. Some building types are combined in the tables. For example,  refrigerated and non-refrigerated warehouses were combined as &ldquo;warehouses,&rdquo; and  skilled nursing care buildings were included in &ldquo;lodging.&rdquo; See <a href="../../building_types.html"><strong>Description of Building Types</strong></a> for a full description  of the principal building activity categories. </P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            <strong>Census Region and  Division</strong>&mdash;The geographical areas as defined by the U.S. Bureau  of Census. See <a href="../../census_maps.html"><strong>Census Regions and Divisions Map</strong></a> for a map that shows  the four Census Regions and nine Census Divisions. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Climate Zone</strong>&mdash;The five  U.S. climate zones are based on the average number of cooling degree-days (CDD)  and heating degree-days (HDD) in a 30-year period (1971-2000). See <a href="../../climate_zones.html"><strong>U.S. Climate Zone Map</strong></a> for a map that shows the five U.S.  climate zones.</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            <strong>Vacancy Status</strong>&mdash;&ldquo;Completely  Vacant&rdquo; buildings are those that are 100 percent vacant; &ldquo;Mostly Vacant&rdquo;  buildings are those in which the majority of the floorspace is vacant;  &ldquo;Partially Vacant&rdquo; are those in which some (but not a majority) of the  floorspace is vacant or some portion of the building was vacant for at least  three consecutive months in 2003; and &ldquo;Not At All Vacant&rdquo; are those in which no  portion of the building was reported as vacant in 2003.</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            <strong>Renovations in  Buildings Constructed Before 1980</strong>&mdash;Buildings that were  constructed in 1980 or any later year were not asked the question about  renovations. So, in this row category, the line &ldquo;Any Type of Renovation Since  1980&rdquo; shows the number of buildings constructed before 1980 that have had any  renovations since 1980, &ldquo;No Renovations Since 1980&rdquo; shows the number of  buildings constructed before 1980 that have not had any renovations since 1980,  and the last line, &ldquo;Building Newer than 1980&rdquo; shows the number of buildings  that were not asked this question because they were constructed after 1980. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Energy Sources</strong>&mdash;Buildings  using a specific type of energy (electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, district  heat [district steam or district hot water], district chilled water, propane,  and any other type of energy [wood, coal, or solar]) for any purpose. In the  building characteristics tables, this row indicates the number of buildings or  floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for any purpose. For  example, in Table B38 (Heating Equipment), the figure in the column  &quot;Furnaces&quot; and the row &quot;Natural Gas&quot; should be interpreted:  &quot;1,314,000 buildings have a furnace and also use natural gas for some  purpose.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  In the consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates total  consumption in buildings that use each energy source for any purpose. For  example, in Table C3, the figure in the column &ldquo;Sum of Major Fuel Consumption  per Square Foot&rdquo; and the row &ldquo;Fuel Oil&rdquo; should be interpreted: &ldquo;Buildings that  used fuel oil for any purpose consumed an average 116,100 Btu of total fuels  per square foot in 2003.&rdquo; (It should NOT be interpreted as the consumption  specifically of fuel oil.)<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Energy End Uses</strong>&mdash;Buildings in which the specific end uses (heating, air-conditioning, water heating, cooking, and manufacturing) were present, NOT the actual amount of energy used for each end use. For example, in Table C1, data in the “Buildings with Cooling” row and in the “Sum of Major Fuels” column should interpreted: “Buildings with cooling consumed a total of 5,464 trillion Btu of the major fuels” (It should NOT be interpreted as the amount of energy specifically used for cooling”). <strong>Neither Table Sets C1-C38 nor C1A-C38A contain any data on the energy consumption for end uses specifically.</strong> End use consumption estimates will be published at a future date.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Space-Heating  Energy Sources</strong>&mdash;Buildings using at least one of the major fuels,  propane, wood, or any other energy source for space heating. In the building  characteristics tables, this row indicates the number of buildings or  floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for space heating. For  example, in Table B38 (Heating Equipment), the figure in the column &quot;Heat  Pumps&quot; and the row &quot;Natural Gas&quot; should be interpreted: &quot;124,000  buildings have a heat pump and also use natural gas as an energy source for  space heating.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted as the number of buildings  that use natural gas to power a heat pump. It is possible that they also use  electricity for space heating, and that electricity is the energy source used  for the heat pump.)</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            In the consumption and expenditures tables, this row indicates  total consumption in buildings that use each energy source for space heating.  For example, in Table C23, the figure in the column &ldquo;Natural Gas Consumption&rdquo;  and the row &ldquo;Natural Gas&rdquo; should be interpreted: &ldquo;1,749 billion cubic feet of  natural gas were used in buildings that use natural gas for space heating.&rdquo; (It  should NOT be interpreted as the consumption of natural gas specifically for  space heating.) <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Primary Space-Heating Energy Source</strong>&mdash;Buildings  using a specific energy source to heat most of the square footage in the  building most of the time. In the building characteristics tables, this row  indicates the number of buildings or floorspace in buildings that use each  energy source for primary space heating. For example, in Table B38 (Heating Equipment),  the figure in the column &quot;Furnaces&quot; and the row  &quot;Electricity&quot; should be interpreted: &quot;296,000 buildings have a  furnace and also use electricity as their primary space-heating energy  source.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted as the number of buildings that use  electricity to power a furnace. It is possible that they use natural gas as a  secondary space-heating energy source, and that natural gas is used as the  energy source for the furnace.) </P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            In the consumption and expenditures tables, this row  indicates total consumption in buildings that use each energy source for  primary space heating. For example, in Table C23, the figure in the column  &ldquo;Natural Gas Consumption&rdquo; and the row &ldquo;Electricity&rdquo; should be interpreted: &ldquo;171  billion cubic feet of natural gas were used in buildings that use electricity  as their primary space heating energy source.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Cooling Energy Source</strong>&mdash;Buildings  using electricity, natural gas, or district chilled water for cooling. In the  building characteristics tables, this row indicates the number of buildings or  floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for cooling. For example,  in Table B40 (Cooling Equipment), the figure in the column &quot;Heat  Pumps&quot; and the row &quot;Natural Gas&quot; should be interpreted:  &quot;8,000 buildings have a heat pump for cooling and also use natural gas for  cooling.&quot; (It should NOT be interpreted as the number of buildings that  use natural gas to power a heat pump. It is possible that the heat pump is  powered by electricity while the natural gas is used to run a chiller.) </P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
          In the consumption and expenditures tables, this row  indicates total consumption in buildings that use each energy source for  cooling. For example, in Table C13, the figure in the column &ldquo;Site Electricity  Consumption&rdquo; and the row &ldquo;Electricity&rdquo; should be interpreted: &ldquo;814 billion kWh  of total electricity were used in buildings that use electricity as a cooling  energy source.&rdquo; (It should NOT be interpreted as the consumption of electricity  specifically for cooling.)</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            <strong>Water-Heating  Energy Source</strong>&mdash;Buildings using one of the major fuels or propane  for water heating. In the building characteristics tables, this row indicates  the number of buildings or floorspace in buildings that use each energy source  for water heating.</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
          In the consumption and expenditures tables, this row  indicates total consumption in buildings that use each energy source for water  heating. For example, in Table C23, the figure in the column &ldquo;Natural Gas  Consumption&rdquo; and the row &ldquo;Natural Gas&rdquo; should be interpreted: &ldquo;1,463 billion  cubic feet of natural gas were used in buildings that use natural gas for water  heating.&rdquo; (It should NOT be interpreted as the consumption of natural gas  specifically for water heating.)</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
            <strong>Cooking Energy  Source</strong>&mdash;Buildings using electricity, natural gas, or propane for  cooking. In the building characteristics tables, this row indicates the number  of buildings or floorspace in buildings that use each energy source for  cooking.</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">
          In the consumption and expenditures tables, this row  indicates total consumption in buildings that use each energy source for  cooking. For example, in Table C13, the figure in the column &ldquo;Site Electricity  Consumption&rdquo; and the row &ldquo;Electricity&rdquo; should be interpreted: &ldquo;249 billion kWh  of electricity were used in buildings that use electricity for cooking.&rdquo; (It  should NOT be interpreted as the consumption of electricity specifically for  cooking.)</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection"><strong>Refrigeration  Equipment</strong>&mdash;In the 2003 CBECS, the refrigeration questions were  changed to include residential-type units and vending machines. As a  consequence, the &ldquo;Any Refrigeration&rdquo; line includes many more buildings than the  line in the 1999 CBECS &ldquo;Commercial Refrigeration Equipment&rdquo; row category  labeled &ldquo;Any Equipment.&rdquo; So, the second line in the 2003 table, &ldquo;Commercial  Refrigeration&rdquo; has been specified to be comparable to the 1999 &ldquo;Any Equipment&rdquo;  row; it includes only walk-in units and refrigerated cases or cabinets.</P>
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection"><strong>Office Equipment</strong>&mdash;Within  this row category, the line &ldquo;With Flat Screen Monitors&rdquo; may need some  clarification. This line represents the number of buildings in which at least  one of their computers has a flat screen (LCD) monitor. For example, in Table  B1, the first two lines of this row category should be interpreted as: &ldquo;There  are about 3,081,000 buildings that have at least one computer; there are about  877,000 buildings for which at least one of the computers in the building has a  flat screen monitor.&rdquo; </P>
          <p>
            <span class="SubSection"><strong>Equipment Usage  Reduced When Building Not In Full Use</strong>&mdash;The figure in the  &quot;Office Equipment&quot; line of this row category is much higher than it  was in the 1999 CBECS; this is not due to drastic increases in behavior, but  instead to differences between the two surveys. In 1999, the question about  whether computers and office equipment were turned off when the building was  closed was asked only if there were 20 or more computers in the building. In  2003, it was asked of every building with any computers. </span></p>
