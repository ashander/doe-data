          <p><span class="SubSection">The estimates in the Commercial 
        Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) are based on data reported by 
        representatives of a statistically-designed subset of the entire 
        commercial building population in the United States, or a "sample".&nbsp; 
        Consequently, the estimates differ from the true population values.&nbsp; However, the sample design permits us to estimate the sampling error in 
        each value. </span>
          </span>
          <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">It is important to 
      understand: CBECS estimates should not be considered as finite point 
      estimates, but as estimates with some associated error in each direction. 
      
          </span>
          <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">The standard error is 
      a measure of the reliability or precision of the survey statistic.&nbsp; 
      The value for the standard error can be used to construct confidence 
      intervals and to perform hypothesis tests by standard statistical 
      methods.&nbsp; Relative Standard Error (RSE) is defined as the standard 
      error (square root of the variance) of a survey estimate, divided by the 
      survey estimate and multiplied by 100. </span>
          <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">The 95-percent 
      confidence range for a given survey estimate can be determined with the 
      RSE.&nbsp; To calculate the 95-percent confidence range: </span>
          <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">1.&nbsp; Divide the 
      RSE by 100 and multiply by the survey estimate to determine the standard 
      error. </span>
          <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">2.&nbsp; Multiply the 
      standard error by 1.96 to determine the confidence error. </span>
          <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">3.&nbsp; The survey 
      estimate plus or minus the confidence error is the 95-percent confidence 
      range. </span>
          <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">For example, from 
      Table A1, the estimate for total floorspace for all commercial buildings 
      in the 2003 CBECS is 71,658 square feet and the estimate's RSE is 3.1 
      percent.&nbsp; The standard error is (3.1/100)*(71,658 million square 
      feet) or 2,221 million square feet.&nbsp; The 95-percent confidence error 
      is (1.96)*(2,221 million square feet), or 4,354 million square feet.&nbsp; Therefore, with 95 percent confidence, the true amount of floorspace in 
      commercial buildings in the U.S. in 2003 was 71,658 plus or minus 4,354 
      million square feet, or, the range was from 67,304 to 76,012 million 
      square feet. </span>
          <P><span class="SubSection"><BR>
       </span><span class="report_bold">Statistical 
      Significance Between Two Statistics</B><BR>
       </span>          
          <P align="justify" class="SubSection">The difference between 
      any two estimates given in the Detailed Tables may or may not be 
      statistically significant. Statistical significance is computed as: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="images/eqn11.gif"><IMG 
      src="images/eqn11.gif" alt="equation" width=153 height=39 border="0"></a> <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      where <I>S</I> is the standard 
      error, <I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB> is the first estimate, and 
      <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB> is the second estimate. The result of this 
      computation is to be multiplied by 1.96 and, if this result is less than 
      the difference between the two estimates, the difference is statistically 
      significant.<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      For example, from Table B1, food sales buildings were an average 5,600 square feet in 2003 with an RSE of 7.5, while health care buildings averaged 24,600 square feet with an RSE of 11.4, for an 
      estimated difference of 19,000 square feet between the two building types. The standard error for food sales
      buildings (<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>) is (7.5/100)*5,600, or 420, and 
      the standard error for health care buildings 
      (<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>) is (11.4/100)*24,600, or 2,804. 
      So,<BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <I>S</I><SUB><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>-<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB></SUB>=(420<SUP>2</SUP>+2,804<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>½</SUP> <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      and 
      <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      <I>S</I><SUB><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>-<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB></SUB>=2,836. <BR>
      &nbsp;<BR>
      Multiplying 
      2,836 by 1.96 yields 5,558. Since 5,558 is less than 19,000, the difference 
      between the two estimates is statistically significant. </p>
