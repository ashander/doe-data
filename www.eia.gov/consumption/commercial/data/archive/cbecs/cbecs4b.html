<A NAME="cb4baa"></a><h2>Column Categories</h2>

The column categories most commonly classify data by consumption and expenditures, though
several other classifications are also given.  The following terms, listed in alphabetical order,
attempt to explain some of the column categories that may require clarification.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Conditional Energy Intensity</FONT></b>--The amount of electricity,
natural gas, fuel oil, or district
heat used per square foot in buildings using the specified energy source.  For example, in Table
3.16, data in the row labeled "Electricity" under "Energy Sources" and in the column labeled
"Northeast" under "Electricity Energy Intensity" would read:  "Buildings in the Northeast that
used electricity as an energy source used 9.3 kilowatthours of electricity per square foot."<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Demand-Metered Buildings</FONT></b>--Buildings that have meters to
measure peak demand (in
addition to total consumption) during a billing period. Peak demand is usually metered only for
electricity.<p> 

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Distribution of Building-Level Intensities</FONT></b>--The amount of
energy used per square foot,
divided into three percentiles:  25th, median, and 75th.  In Table 3.15, for example, the row
labeled "Education" under "Principal Building Activity" in the columns under "Distribution of
Building-Level Intensities" would read:  "In 1992, 25 percent of U.S. education buildings used
4.0 kilowatthours per square foot or less, while 75 percent of the buildings used more than 4.0
kilowatthours of electricity per square foot."<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Electricity</FONT></b>--Site electricity.  (See "site electricity" and
"primary electricity" in this
listing.)<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Energy Intensity</FONT></b>--Usually defined as "gross energy
intensity" or "conditional energy
intensity" in title of table.  If table title does not specify, "energy intensity" is to be defined as
"conditional energy intensity." <p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Floorspace</FONT></b>--The enclosed area in a building; the sum of the
floorspace in all buildings
in a category.<p> 


<b><FONT SIZE=4>Gross Energy Intensity</FONT></b>--The ratio of the total amount of
energy consumed by a group
of buildings to the total floorspace of those buildings, including buildings and floorspace where
the energy source is not used.  For example, in Table 3.7, data in the row category "Education"
under "Principal Building Activity" and in the column category of "Northeast" would read: 
"Education buildings in the Northeast consumed 87.1 thousand Btu per square foot."<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Major Fuel</FONT></b>--Major energy sources:  electricity, natural gas,
fuel oil, and district heat
(district steam and district hot water).  Although electricity is technically not a fuel, "Major
Fuel," rather than "Major Energy Source," was retained as the title of this category to facilitate
comparison of 1992 and 1989 CBECS data.
<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Primary Electricity</FONT></b>--Site electricity plus the conversion
losses in the electric generation
process at the utility plant.  Most of the tables present statistics for site consumption alone, but
Tables 3.2 and 3.14 also provide consumption statistics for primary electricity.  <p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Site Electricity</FONT></b>--The amount of electricity delivered to the
commercial building.  This
amount excludes conversion losses in the electric generation process at the utility plant.  (See
"primary electricity" in this listing.)  Most of the tables in this section provide statistics for site
electricity alone (not on primary electricity).  When the term "electricity" is used, the reference
is to site electricity.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Total of Major Fuels</FONT></b>--The sum of site electricity, natural
gas, fuel oil, and district heat. 
Statistics in this column exclude data from the column "Primary Electricity."

<p><b><h2>Row Categories</h2></b>

The row categories classify data by specific features, such as energy source or end use.  Data in
the row categories relate to the buildings having such a feature, not to the feature.  For example,
in Table 3.4, the data in the "Major Fuels" column and the row category "Buildings with A/C" is
to be read as "Buildings with air conditioning consumed 5,345 trillion Btu of the major fuels."
The table contains no data on the energy consumption for air conditioning specifically. 
Although the row categories and subcategories are similar in all the tables, the specific-fuel
tables provide more categories of data than are presented in the major fuel tables.  For example,
the electricity tables provide data on buildings containing refrigeration and lighting equipment
and computers.<p>

The Glossary provides detailed definitions of the terms used in the tables.  Below are
explanations of some of the row categories, in a consumption or expenditures column, that may
require clarification, listed in the order in which they occur in the tables.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>All Buildings</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures for roofed and
walled structures whose
principal activities are nonresidential, nonagricultural, and nonindustrial and which are larger
than one thousand square feet (roughly twice the size of a two-car garage).<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Principal Building Activity</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures
for buildings grouped by the
activity that occupies the most floorspace in the buildings. Some building types are combined in
the tables.  For example, inpatient and outpatient health care facilities were combined as "health
care buildings," and refrigerated and nonrefrigerated warehouses were combined as
"warehouses," and skilled nursing buildings were included in "lodging."  The category
"assembly" in the 1989 CBECS was broken into "public assembly" and "religious worship" for
the 1992 CBECS.  See Appendix E, "Types of Buildings," for a full description of the principal
building activity categories.<p>


<b><FONT SIZE=4>Climate Zone</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures for
commercial buildings located in one of
the five U.S. climate zones, based on the average number of cooling degree-days (CDD) and
heating degree-days (HDD) in a 45-year period (1931-1975).  See Appendix F, "U.S. Climate
Zone and Census Regions and Divisions Maps," for a map showing the five U.S. climate
zones.<p> 

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Census Region and Division</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures
for commercial buildings
located in one of the nine divisions within four regions as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Census. 
See Appendix F, "U.S. Climate Zones and Census Regions and Divisions Maps," for a map
showing the four Census regions and nine Census divisions.<p>

 <b><FONT SIZE=4>Energy Sources</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures for
buildings using a specific type of
energy (electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, district heat [district steam and district hot water],
district chilled water, propane, and any other type of energy [wood, coal, active solar, and
photovoltaic cells]).  The tables contain consumption data based on billing information obtained
from energy suppliers, for the first four sources only.  Estimates of the amount of wood burned
in buildings were obtained during the personal interviews with building respondents.  No
consumption data were collected for propane, coal, solar energy, or other renewable sources
because such a collection effort would not be feasible.<p>  

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Energy End Uses</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures in
buildings that had specific end uses
(heating, air conditioning, water heating, cooking, and manufacturing), not the amount of energy
consumption or expenditures for a particular end use. <p> 

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Energy-Related Space Functions</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings that had
space for commercial food preparation or computer use, space using special ventilation, or space
where activities requiring large amounts of hot water took place.  The tables contain no data on
the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for these specific activities.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Space-Heating Energy Sources</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings using at least
one of the major fuels, propane, wood, or any other energy source for space heating.  (In some
tables, this category is subdivided into "Main and Secondary Energy Sources.")  The tables
contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for space heating
specifically. <p> 

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Main Space-Heating Energy Source</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings using a
specific energy source to heat most of the square footage in the building most of the time.  The
tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for space heating
specifically.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Replacement Energy Source for Main
Heating</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures in
buildings using a replacement energy source (a heating source to which a building could switch
within 1 week without major modifications to the main heating equipment, without substantially
reducing the area heated, and without substantially reducing the temperature maintained in the
heated area).  The tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures
for replacement heating specifically.
<p>
<b><FONT SIZE=4>Cooling Energy Source</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures in
buildings using electricity,
natural gas, or district chilled water for cooling.  The tables contain no data on the amount of
energy consumption or expenditures for cooling specifically.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Water-Heating Energy Source</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings using one of
the major fuels or propane for water heating.  The tables contain no data on the amount of
energy consumption or expenditures for water heating specifically.<p>


<b><FONT SIZE=4>Cooking Energy Source</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures in
buildings using electricity,
natural gas, or propane for cooking.  The tables contain no data on the amount of energy
consumption or expenditures for cooking specifically.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Manufacturing Energy Sources</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings using
electricity, natural gas, or other energy source for manufacturing.  The tables contain no data on
the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for manufacturing specifically.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Heating Equipment</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures in
buildings that had at least one
type of heating equipment. The tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or
expenditures for the specific types of heating equipment.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Heating Distribution Equipment</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings that had at
least one type of heating-distribution equipment.  The tables contain no data on the amount of
energy consumption or expenditures for the specific types of heating-distribution
equipment.Cooling EquipmentConsumption or expenditures in buildings that had at least one
type of cooling equipment. The tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or
expenditures for the specific types of cooling equipment.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Cooling Distribution Equipment</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings that had at
least one type of cooling-distribution equipment.  The tables contain no data on the amount of
energy consumption or expenditures for the specific types of cooling-distribution equipment.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Water-Heating Equipment</FONT></b>--Consumption or expenditures in
buildings that had a
centralized system, a distributed system, or both.  The tables contain no data on the amount of
energy consumption or expenditures for the specific types of water-heating equipment.<p>

<b><FONT SIZE=4>Energy Conservation Features</FONT></b>--Consumption or
expenditures in buildings that had any
feature designed to reduce the amount of energy consumed by the building because of its:<p>
<ul>
<li>
Shell, such as insulation, storm windows, or tinted glass</ul> <p>
