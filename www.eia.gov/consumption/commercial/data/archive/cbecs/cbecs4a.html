A series of detailed data tables were prepared for the report Buildings and Energy in the
1980's,
DOE/EIA-0555(95)/1 (Washington, DC, June 1995).  The 347 tables were assembled from six
Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) data bases for the years 1980, 1981, 1982,
1984, 1987, and 1990; and four Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)
data bases for the years 1979, 1983, 1986, and 1989.  Prior to 1989, the CBECS was known as
the Nonresidential Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (NBECS).  Buildings and Energy in
the 1980's should be referred to for details about how the tables were constructed, how the
surveys were conducted, and for analysis of the data.<P>

Energy consumption statistics are reported in terms of both primary and site electricity
consumption.  Site energy is reported for all other individual energy sources.  Primary electricity
consumption takes into account the energy inputs used to generate, transmit, and distribute
electricity.  Site energy consumption is the amount of energy delivered to a site.  Where total
consumption estimates for all energy sources are given, totals that include both primary and site
electricity are provided.<P>

Listed below are the table titles for residential and commercial building types.  Each table
number identifies the type of building ("R" for residential and "C" for commercial), the survey
year and, where appropriate, an identifier for primary or site energy ("p" or "s").  For example,
Table R8.90p, shows primary energy data for residential buildings for the 1990 survey year.<P>

The tables are arranged into five groups, with the first providing information on building
characteristics, energy sources, and end uses by number of buildings and total floorspace.  The
second group gives estimates on energy consumption, energy intensities, energy expenditures,
and expenditure intensities by energy source.  The third group  provides estimates of energy
consumption by energy source and the fourth group estimates of consumption by end use.  The
last group provides data on energy expenditures by energy source and end use.
<P> The table titles are shown below with the title number using 1990 for residential 
  buildings, and 1989 for commercial buildings as examples. A note at the end 
  of each set indicates years where particular table data are not available. <p><br>
