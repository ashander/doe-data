        <p></p><FONT SIZE="+2" ><B>T</B></FONT>he first set of detailed tables for the 
        1992 CBECS, Tables A1 through A70, contain the number of buildings and 
        amount of floorspace for major building characteristics. Tables A2 through 
        A28 address location, building size, year constructed, number of workers, 
        hours of operation, types of occupancy, multibuilding facilities, and 
        special space functions. Tables A29 through A43 contain data about the 
        energy sources used for all end uses and for specific major end uses. 
        Tables A44 through A46 contain data about percent of floorspace heated, 
        cooled, and lit. Tables A47 through A56 contain data on energy-using equipment 
        types, and Tables A57 through A67 contain data on conservation and energy 
        management features. The last group of building characteristics tables 
        include special data tabulations. Table A1 is a summary table, Table A68 
        provides total number of buildings and amount of floorspace for all principal 
        building activities, and Tables A69 and A70 contain data on energy sources 
        used for selected energy uses. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        The second set of tables consists of energy consumption and expenditures 
        Tables 3.1 through 3.49, which present detailed energy consumption and 
        expenditure data for buildings in the commercial sector. These tables 
        are grouped into major fuel tables (Tables 3.1 through 3.13) and specific 
        energy source tables. The specific energy source tables consist of Tables 
        3.14 through 3.29 for electricity, Tables 3.30 through 3.40 for natural 
        gas, Tables 3.41 through 3.45 for fuel oil, and Tables 3.46 and 3.47 for 
        district heat. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        The third set of tables consists of energy end-use Tables 1 through 6, 
        which contain estimates of the amount of natural gas and electricity that 
        is consumed for nine specific end uses: space heating, cooling, ventilation, 
        water heating, lighting, cooking, refrigeration, office equipment, and 
        other.

        <A NAME="column"></A> <FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B>Column Categories</B></FONT> <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <FONT SIZE="+2"><B>T</B></FONT>he column categories most commonly classify 
        data by consumption and expenditures, though several other classifications 
        are also given. The following terms, listed in alphabetical order, attempt 
        to explain some of the column categories that may require clarification. 
        <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Conditional Energy Intensity</b>&#151;The amount of electricity, natural 
        gas, fuel oil, or district heat used per square foot in buildings using 
        the specified energy source. For example, in Table 3.16, data in the row 
        labeled &#147;Electricity&#148; under &#147;Energy Sources&#148; and in 
        the column labeled &#147;Northeast&#148; under &#147;Electricity Energy 
        Intensity&#148; would read: &#147;Buildings in the Northeast that used 
        electricity as an energy source used 9.3 kilowatthours of electricity 
        per square foot.&#148; <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Demand-Metered Buildings</b>&#151;Buildings that have meters to measure 
        peak demand (in addition to total consumption) during a billing period. 
        Peak demand is usually metered only for electricity. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Distribution of Building-Level Intensities</b>&#151;The amount of energy 
        used per square foot, divided into three percentiles: 25th, median, and 
        75th. In Table 3.15, for example, the row labeled &#147;Education&#148; 
        under &#147;Principal Building Activity&#148; in the columns under &#147;Distribution 
        of Building-Level Intensities&#148; would read: &#147;In 1992, 25 percent 
        of U.S. education buildings used 4.0 kilowatthours per square foot or 
        less, while 75 percent of the buildings used more than 4.0 kilowatthours 
        of electricity per square foot.&#148; <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Electricity</b>&#151;Site electricity. (See &#147;site electricity&#148; 
        and &#147;primary electricity&#148; in this listing.) <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Energy Intensity</b>&#151;Usually defined as &#147;gross energy intensity&#148; 
        or &#147;conditional energy intensity&#148; in title of table. If table 
        title does not specify, &#147;energy intensity&#148; is to be defined 
        as &#147;conditional energy intensity.&#148; <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Floorspace</b>&#151;The enclosed area in a building; the sum of the 
        floorspace in all buildings in a category. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Gross Energy Intensity</b>&#151;The ratio of the total amount of energy 
        consumed by a group of buildings to the total floorspace of those buildings, 
        including buildings and floorspace where the energy source is not used. 
        For example, in Table 3.7, data in the row category &#147;Education&#148; 
        under &#147;Principal Building Activity&#148; and in the column category 
        of &#147;Northeast&#148; would read: &#147;Education buildings in the 
        Northeast consumed 87.1 thousand Btu per square foot.&#148; <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Major Fuel</b>&#151;Major energy sources: electricity, natural gas, 
        fuel oil, and district heat (district steam and district hot water). Although 
        electricity is technically not a fuel, &#147;Major Fuel,&#148; rather 
        than &#147;Major Energy Source,&#148; was retained as the title of this 
        category to facilitate comparison of 1992 and 1989 CBECS data. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Primary Electricity</b>&#151;Site electricity plus the conversion losses 
        in the electric generation process at the utility plant. Most of the tables 
        present statistics for site consumption alone, but Tables 3.2 and 3.14 
        also provide consumption statistics for primary electricity. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Site Electricity</b>&#151;The amount of electricity delivered to the 
        commercial building. This amount excludes conversion losses in the electric 
        generation process at the utility plant. (See &#147;primary electricity&#148; 
        in this listing.) Most of the tables in this section provide statistics 
        for site electricity alone (not on primary electricity). When the term 
        &#147;electricity&#148; is used, the reference is to site electricity. 
        <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Total of Major Fuels</b>&#151;The sum of site electricity, natural 
        gas, fuel oil, and district heat. Statistics in this column exclude data 
        from the column &#147;Primary Electricity.&#148; 
		
		 <p><BR>
        <A NAME="row"></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B>Row Categories</B></FONT> <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <FONT SIZE="+2"><B>T</B></FONT>he row categories classify data by specific 
        features, such as energy source or end use. Data in the row categories 
        relate to the buildings having such a feature, not to the feature. For 
        example, in Table 3.4, the data in the &#147;Major Fuels&#148; column 
        and the row category &#147;Buildings with A/C&#148; is to be read as &#147;Buildings 
        with air conditioning consumed 5,345 trillion Btu of the major fuels.&#148; 
        The table contains no data on the energy consumption for air conditioning 
        specifically. Although the row categories and subcategories are similar 
        in all the tables, the specific-fuel tables provide more categories of 
        data than are presented in the major fuel tables. For example, the electricity 
        tables provide data on buildings containing refrigeration and lighting 
        equipment and computers. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        Below are explanations of some of the row categories, in a consumption 
        or expenditures column, that may require clarification, listed in the 
        order in which they occur in the tables. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>All Buildings</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures for roofed and walled 
        structures whose principal activities are nonresidential, nonagricultural, 
        and nonindustrial and which are larger than one thousand square feet (roughly 
        twice the size of a two-car garage). <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Principal Building Activity</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures for 
        buildings grouped by the activity that occupies the most floorspace in 
        the buildings. Some building types are combined in the tables. For example, 
        inpatient and outpatient health care facilities were combined as &#147;health 
        care buildings,&#148; and refrigerated and nonrefrigerated warehouses 
        were combined as &#147;warehouses,&#148; and skilled nursing buildings 
        were included in &#147;lodging.&#148; The category &#147;assembly&#148; 
        in the 1989 CBECS was broken into &#147;public assembly&#148; and &#147;religious 
        worship&#148; for the 1992 CBECS. See <A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/building_types.html">&#147;Description 
        of types of buildings&#148;</A> for a full description of the principal 
        building activity categories. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Climate Zone</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures for commercial buildings 
        located in one of the five U.S. climate zones, based on the average number 
        of cooling degree-days (CDD) and heating degree-days (HDD) in a 45-year 
        period (1931-1975). See <A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/climate_zones.html">&#147;U.S. Climate 
        Zones map&#148;</A> for a map that shows the five U.S. climate zones. 
        <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Census Region and Division</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures for 
        commercial buildings located in one of the nine divisions within four 
        regions as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Census. See <A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/census-maps.cfm">&#147;Census 
        Regions and Divisions map&#148;</A> for a map that shows the four Census 
        regions and nine Census divisions. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Energy Sources</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures for buildings using 
        a specific type of energy (electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, district 
        heat [district steam and district hot water], district chilled water, 
        propane, and any other type of energy [wood, coal, active solar, and photovoltaic 
        cells]). The tables contain consumption data based on billing information 
        obtained from energy suppliers, for the first four sources only. Estimates 
        of the amount of wood burned in buildings were obtained during the personal 
        interviews with building respondents. No consumption data were collected 
        for propane, coal, solar energy, or other renewable sources because such 
        a collection effort would not be feasible. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Energy End Uses</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in buildings that 
        had specific end uses (heating, air conditioning, water heating, cooking, 
        and manufacturing), not the amount of energy consumption or expenditures 
        for a particular end use. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Energy-Related Space Functions</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures 
        in buildings that had space for commercial food preparation or computer 
        use, space using special ventilation, or space where activities requiring 
        large amounts of hot water took place. The tables contain no data on the 
        amount of energy consumption or expenditures for these specific activities. 
        <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Space-Heating Energy Sources</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in 
        buildings using at least one of the major fuels, propane, wood, or any 
        other energy source for space heating. (In some tables, this category 
        is subdivided into &#147;Main and Secondary Energy Sources.&#148;) The 
        tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures 
        for space heating specifically. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Main Space-Heating Energy Source</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures 
        in buildings using a specific energy source to heat most of the square 
        footage in the building most of the time. The tables contain no data on 
        the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for space heating specifically. 
        <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Replacement Energy Source for Main Heating</b>&#151;Consumption or 
        expenditures in buildings using a replacement energy source (a heating 
        source to which a building could switch within one week without major 
        modifications to the main heating equipment, without substantially reducing 
        the area heated, and without substantially reducing the temperature maintained 
        in the heated area). The tables contain no data on the amount of energy 
        consumption or expenditures for replacement heating specifically. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Cooling Energy Source</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in buildings 
        using electricity, natural gas, or district chilled water for cooling. 
        The tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures 
        for cooling specifically. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Water-Heating Energy Source</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in 
        buildings using one of the major fuels or propane for water heating. The 
        tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures 
        for water heating specifically. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Cooking Energy Source</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in buildings 
        using electricity, natural gas, or propane for cooking. The tables contain 
        no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for cooking 
        specifically. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Manufacturing Energy Sources</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in 
        buildings using electricity, natural gas, or other energy source for manufacturing. 
        The tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures 
        for manufacturing specifically. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Heating Equipment</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in buildings 
        that had at least one type of heating equipment. The tables contain no 
        data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for the specific 
        types of heating equipment. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <b>Heating Distribution Equipment</b>&#151;Consumption or expenditures 
        in buildings that had at least one type of heating-distribution equipment. 
        The tables contain no data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures 
        for the specific types of heating-distribution equipment. <BR>
        &nbsp;<BR>
        <B>Cooling Equipment</B>&#151;Consumption or expenditures in buildings 
        that had at least one type of cooling equipment. The tables contain no 
        data on the amount of energy consumption or expenditures for the specific 
        types of cooling equipment. <BR>
