<p><center><strong><H2>Introduction</H2></strong></center>


<p>All of the statistics published in this report are estimates of population values, such as the total floorspace of
commercial buildings in the United States.  These estimates are based on reported data from representatives of a
randomly chosen subset of the entire population of commercial buildings.  As a result, the estimates always differ
from the true population values.

<br wp="br1">
<p>The differences between the estimated values and the actual population values are due to two types of errors:
<OL>

<LI>Sampling Errors: These errors are random differences between the survey estimate and the population
value that occur because the survey estimate is calculated from a randomly chosen subset of the entire
population.  The sampling error, averaged over all possible samples, would be zero, but since there is only
one sample for the 1995 CBECS, the sampling error is nonzero and unknown for the particular sample
chosen.  However, the sample design permits sampling errors to be estimated. 

 <A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/char95/appendb.html#toc13">
<strong>Estimation of Standard Errors</strong></A> describes how the sampling error is estimated and presented for statistics given in this report and the Building Characteristics 1995 report. 


<p>	
<lI>  Nonsampling errors, which are errors related to sources of variability that originate apart from the
sampling process and would be expected to occur in all possible samples or in the average of all estimates
from all possible samples.
</OL>

<p>The sections titled "Annual Consumption and Expenditures" and "Annual Peak Electricity Demand," describe some
of the sources of nonsampling error in the Energy Suppliers Survey and how the survey is designed and conducted
to minimize such errors.  

<br wp="br1">
<p>Nonsampling errors can result from: (1) inaccuracy in the data collection due to questionnaire design errors,
interviewer error, respondent misunderstanding, and data processing errors; (2) nonresponse for an entire sampled
building (unit nonresponse); and (3) nonresponse on a particular question from a responding building (item
nonresponse). 

 ( See <A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/char95/appendb.html"><strong>Appendix B</strong></A> in the <EM>Building Characteristics 1995</em> internet release for a discussion of nonsampling and sampling errors associated with the Building Characteristics Survey portion of CBECS.)

<br wp="br1">
<p>Most unit nonresponse cases occurred because an appropriate respondent was unavailable or declined to participate
in the survey.  Item nonresponse resulted when the respondent did not know, or, less frequently, refused to give the
answer to a particular question.  Unlike the sampling error, the magnitude of nonsampling error cannot easily be
estimated from the sample data.  For this reason, avoiding biases at the outset is a primary objective of all stages of
survey design and field procedures.  The wording and format of survey questionnaires, the procedures used to select
and train interviewers, and the quality control built into the data collection, receipt, and processing operations were
all designed to minimize these sources of error. 

<br wp="br1">
<p>The consumption and expenditures featured in this report were based on monthly billing records submitted by the
buildings' energy suppliers.  The section, <STRONG><a Href="ceapp-b.html#ceapp-b2">Annual Consumption and Expenditures</A></STRONG>
provides a detailed explanation of the procedures used to obtain annual consumption and expenditure estimates
from the bills, as well as the procedures used to handle partial or completely missing data.  The peak electricity
demand estimates in this report were also based on the monthly billing data, as described in the section, <strong> <A Href="ceapp-b.html#ceapp-b3">Annual
Peak Electricity  Demand</A></strong>   

<br wp="br1">
<p>The section titled <a Href="ceapp-b.html#ceapp-b4"><strong>"Additional Data Notes</strong></A> discusses special problems encountered when
reconciling building and supplier reports on the types of energy sources used, and on gas transported for the
account of others.  This section also briefly discusses the estimation of energy end use intensities.



<br wp="br1">
<p><H2><center><STRONG>Nonresponse</STRONG></center></H2>



<p>
<A Name="ceapp-b8"><STRONG>Unit Nonresponse: </STRONG></A>The response rate for the 1995 Building Characteristics Survey portion of CBECS, 87.5 percent. 
That is, of the 6,590 buildings eligible for interview, 12.5 percent did not respond at all to the Building
Characteristics Survey.    The unit response rate for the Energy Suppliers Survey was 84.9 percent.  This response
rate for that portion of the CBECS varies by energy source.  See <a Href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/ceapp-a.html#5"> <strong>Appendix A, Data Collection Procedures</strong></A>
  for more discussion on the nonresponse rate by energy sources.


<p>Weight adjustment was the method used to reduce unit nonresponse bias in the survey statistics.  The CBECS
sample was designed so that survey responses could be used to estimate characteristics of the entire population of
commercial buildings in the United States.  Weight adjustment calculated basic sampling weights (base weights)
that related the sampled buildings to the entire stock of commercial buildings.  In statistical terms, a base weight is
the reciprocal of the probability of selecting a building into the sample.  A base weight can be understood as the
number of actual buildings represented by a sampled building:  a sampled building that has a base weight of 1,000
represents itself and 999 similar (but unsampled) buildings in the total stock of buildings.


<p>To reduce the bias from unit nonresponse in the survey statistics, the base weights of respondent buildings were
adjusted upward, so that the respondent buildings would represent not only unsampled buildings but also
nonrespondent buildings.  The base weights of respondent buildings were multiplied by the adjustment factor  "A,"
defined as the sum of the base weights over all buildings selected for the sample divided by the corresponding sum
over all respondent buildings.  Respondent weights remained nonzero after weight adjustment.  Nonrespondent
weights were set to zero, because they were accounted for by the upward adjustment of respondent weights.


<p><STRONG>Item Nonresponse:</STRONG> Item nonresponse is the type of nonresponse that occurs when an item (or several items) is
missing in an otherwise completed questionnaire.  The Energy Suppliers Survey consisted of four distinct data
collections (electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heating surveys) to obtain the 1995 consumption
information for buildings in the Building Characteristics Survey.  Partial and complete nonresponse in the Energy
Suppliers Survey are discussed in the following section,  "Annual Consumption and Expenditures."

<P><BR>

<a  NAME="ceapp-b2"><center><H2><STRONG>Annual Consumption and Expenditures</STRONG></H2></center></A>


<p>This report presents estimates of energy consumption and expenditures in commercial buildings during calendar
year 1995.  These estimates were computed from the annual consumption and expenditures determined for each
building in the CBECS sample.  However, these "annual" values were not obtained directly from the suppliers for
the buildings.  Rather, energy suppliers provided monthly billing data, which were used to calculate calendar year
consumption and expenditures for each building, according to the procedures described in this section.  Also
described in this section are the imputation procedures used in cases where the energy supplier survey data were
unavailable or inadequate.


<p>To assure that calendar year 1995 consumption would be completely accounted for, the data requested from
suppliers were bills covering the period from December 1994 through January 1996.  These bills formed the basis
for the annual energy consumption and expenditures estimates published in this report.


<P><BR>
<H3><STRONG>Billing Data:  Ideal and Reality</STRONG></H3>


<p>The basic consumption and expenditures data for were reported for each building by billing period.  Ideally, the
data for each continuous-delivery energy source (electricity, natural gas, and district heating) used in each
sampled building should have been in the form of complete records for every billing period that fell within
calendar year 1995, providing complete coverage for 1995 and covering exactly the energy consumed within the
sampled building.  The data for the discrete-delivery energy source (fuel oil) should have been in the form of
complete data records for all deliveries during 1995.  For both continuous- and discrete-delivery energy sources,
the delivered energy source should have been used entirely within the sampled building.  


<p>In practice, though, the billing data often covered more or less square footage than just the sampled building's
square footage, or did not match the target time frame, calendar year 1995.  There were several common types of
discrepancy between the bill coverage and the ideal of a single building and fixed time frame.


<p>		
<UL>
<p>
<li>Bill coverage included days in 1994 and 1996 as well as calendar year 1995.  This was the typical situation
for a complete billing record.  Rarely would one billing period begin on January 1 and another end on December 31, 1995.
<P>
<LI>Bill coverage spanned at least a 1-year period, but did not include all of 1995.  In most such cases, the time frame covered by the bills extended from the middle of 1995 into the middle of 1996.  Many energy suppliers maintain accessible billing records only for the most recent 13 months.  Thus, at the time of reporting, the data available did not cover the beginning of 1995.
<P>
<LI>Bill coverage spanned less than a 1-year period.
<P>
<LI>Bill coverage was for several sampled buildings combined.  This occurred when no authorization form was obtained to authorize the supplier to provide data for individual buildings.  In such cases, the supplier reported only annual totals for a group of sampled buildings summed together.
<P>
<LI>Bill coverage included nonsampled buildings or equipment outside the sampled buildings, as well as the one sampled building.
<P>
<LI>Bill coverage excluded some of the building's occupants or tenants.  This under coverage occurred when the energy supplier had several customers in a sampled building and was unable to identify all of them on the basis of the information provided by the Building Characteristics Survey respondent.  In a few cases, energy suppliers were unwilling to release information on all customers in a building, even in aggregate form, without having a separate authorization from each.
<P>
<LI>The problem of determining bill coverage was compounded by incomplete dates.  In the most common case, the billing period date included a month and year, but not the day of the month.

</UL>


<p>To reconcile the discrepancies between the ideal billing data and what could actually be obtained, the following
seven processing steps were taken:


<p>	
<OL>
<LI>Classify each set of bills, from a particular energy supplier for a particular building, as to coverage in terms of both building and time frame.
<P>
<LI>Complete the billing dates for all bills
<P>
<LI>Annualize bills with full-year time frame coverage
<P>
<LI>Annualize bills with part-year time frame coverage
<P>
<LI>Adjust annualized bills, for building over and undercoverage
<P>
<LI>Impute annual consumption and expenditures for buildings with completely missing data

</OL>



<p><BR>
Each of these processing steps is explained below.


<p><BR>
<A Name="ceapp-b6"><H4>Step 1.  Classifying Coverage of Building and Time Frame</H4></A>


<p>This classification was performed by the CBECS contractor as part of the data collection record keeping.  To
track responses to the mailed Energy Suppliers Survey, determination had to be made whether a response received
represented complete data for a building.  In many cases, follow-up letters converted initial responses from partial
to complete, or more nearly complete.  In other cases, the incomplete response was all that could be obtained.


<p><STRONG>Determining Time Frame</STRONG>: An important aspect of the time-frame classification was determining why data were
missing for part of calendar year 1995.  The main question was whether consumption had actually taken place
during the entire year or was actually zero during the unreported time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If consumption occurred through the entire year, data might be missing for several reasons.  For example,  the
supplier's active records might not go back far enough or the data may simply have been lost from the supplier's
record, even though in general these records did go back to the beginning of 1995.


<p>A more complicated situation occurred when a new customer occupied a building in the middle of the target year. 
The data provided for this customer, for which the authorization form was signed, would be complete, but the
data for the previous occupant, who consumed energy in the first part of the year, would be missing.  In any case
where part of the year's consumption data were missing, annual consumption would be understated if the reported
1995 data were treated as complete, rather than being inflated to account for the missing period.


<p>The opposite situation could occur if a customer first occupied the building in the middle of the year, with no
previous customer occupying the building.  In this case, with no consumption during the first part of the year,
annual consumption would be overstated if the reported data were annualized as if consumption occurred year
round.


<p>A special set of questions on the Energy Suppliers Survey forms was designed to determine if any change in
customers had occurred during the target year, and if so how these customers were covered in the reported data. 
However, most suppliers did not answer these questions.  As a general rule, data were treated as complete if they
covered a full year, whether calendar 1995 or not.  Part-year data were treated as incomplete, unless the supplier
specifically indicated otherwise.


<p>Particularly complicated were some electricity and natural gas cases where individual records were provided for
each customer in a building with several customers.  In most such cases, bills for all the customers covered the
same time frame.  Sometimes, though, different customers' records covered different time frames.  In these
cases, it was assumed that the data were complete for each customer, but the customers began or ended service at
different times during the year.  Aggregate consumption and expenditures were therefore computed for each time
period by summing whichever customers had consumption during that period.  If consumption was present for a
particular customer in a particular period but expenditures were missing (or vice versa) aggregate expenditures (or
consumption) were left as missing.


<p><strong>Determining Building Coverage:</strong> Building coverage was determined from information obtained from both the
Building Characteristics Survey respondent and the energy suppliers. Two types of problems could arise:  (1) the
energy bills covered more buildings than just the sampled building or (2) the energy bills omitted some of the
building's occupants.  In the first case, if the Building Characteristics Survey respondent indicated that a particular
supplier's bill covered several buildings, the total square footage of buildings on that bill was requested.  Then a
disaggregation factor was computed as the ratio of the sampled building's square footage to this total square footage. 
This factor allowed the total reported consumption to be adjusted downward to cover only the sampled buildings. 
In the second case, when the billing data omitted some customers in a building, an aggregation factor was computed. 
This factor was usually the ratio of the number of customers in the building to the number reported.  Where more
detailed information was available, the aggregation factor was the ratio of the total building floorspace to the
floorspace occupied by the reported customers. For those cases, the reported consumption of only a portion of the
building was adjusted upward to represent consumption in the building as a whole.


<p><BR>
<A Name="ceapp-b7"><H4>Step 2.  Complete Billing Dates
</H4></A>

<p>Virtually all missing billing dates were one of two types.  The first type of dates that were incomplete had the
month and year entered, but the day was missing for the beginning and ending dates of all billing periods on a
record.  These cases were imputed by assigning "16" to each beginning date and "15" to each ending date.

<p>The second type of incomplete dates were missing the day of the month for some, but not all, billing periods.  For
each case of this second type, the billing periods affected were either bounded (surrounded by billing periods with
known beginning and ending dates), or unbounded (either at the beginning or end of the set of billing periods). 
Any set of consecutive bounded billing periods with missing dates was assigned billing dates that would make all
billing periods in the set have as close to the same number of days as possible.  Unbounded billing periods were
assigned beginning and/or ending dates as needed so that the number of days in each unbounded period was the
same as the median number of days in billing periods of known length.


<p><BR>
<A Name="10"><H4>Step 3.  Annualizing Full-Year Data</H4></A>

<p>One of the main reasons that the CBECS requested energy supplier data from December 1994 through January
1996 was to assure that 1995 consumption would be completely accounted for in the case of a complete response. 
However, unless a billing period happened to end on December 31, 1994, or December 31, 1995, consumption as
reported by the energy suppliers ran over from the target period of calendar 1995, forward into 1996 and
backward into 1994.  In general, then, procedures were required to trim away these excess data.  For this
trimming, different procedures were used for continuous- and discrete-delivery energy sources.

<p><strong>Continuous-Delivery Energy Sources (electricity, natural gas, and district sources):</strong> Consumption and
expenditures for a billing period extending into 1996 were adjusted by splitting the overlapping period into two
subperiods, one running from the beginning date through December 31, the other from January 1 through the
billing or meter reading date.  Consumption and expenditures were prorated according to the number of days in
each subperiod, and the consumption and expenditures for the subperiod that fell in 1995 were included in the
total expenditures and consumption for 1995.  An analogous procedure was used for a billing period extending
into 1994.  The assumption that the use of continuous-delivery energy sources took place at a constant rate
throughout the billing period may be incorrect for any particular building.  However, the procedure should yield
approximately unbiased overall estimates.

<p><strong>Discrete-delivery Energy Sources (fuel oil):</strong>  Billing periods extending outside 1995 did not affect the
discrete-delivery energy source (fuel oil) because, for this energy source, all deliveries during 1995 were
accumulated.  For fuel oil, the ending dates on the bills were used to determine which bills were for deliveries
during 1995.  No attempt was made to prorate bills, since there was no necessary connection between billing dates
and consumption, as was the case for continuous-delivery energy sources.


<p>For both continuous- and discrete-delivery  cases where the billing time frame covered a full year but was shifted
so that either the beginning or the end of 1995 was not included, a similar procedure was used.  In these cases, the
data were annualized to a 1-year period within the reported time frame, overlapping as much as possible with
1995. 


<p><BR>
<H4>Step 4.  <STRONG>Annualizing Part-Year Data</STRONG></H4>


<p>The annualization procedures for cases that had partial billing data, but less than a full year, were also different
for continuous- and discrete-delivery energy sources.  

<p><strong>Continuous-Delivery Energy Sources:</strong>  The number of reported days of consumption was at least as large as the
number of reported days of expenditures for almost all sets of bill.  Expenditures were annualized using the partial
expenditures data and the annualized consumption data. 

<p>The part-year annualization method for the consumption of continuous-delivery energy sources depended on the
number of days of reported consumption.  If at least 331 days were reported, then consumption for the missing
portion of the year was imputed by computing the average consumption per day for the adjacent billing period(s),
then multiplying by the number of days of missing data.  In certain cases, at least 331 days of consumption were
reported, but 365 days of expenditures were reported.  In these cases, the missing consumption was computed
using the average price for billing periods in which both consumption and expenditures were reported.  Summing
all reported and imputed consumption then yielded the total annual consumption.


<p>Expenditure imputations were performed after completion of all imputations for partially missing consumption
since (1) consumption data were usually more complete than expenditures data; and (2) given a value for
consumption, the expenditures could be estimated without a great deal of difficulty.

<p>As was true for consumption, the imputation procedure for missing continuous-delivery expenditures was
determined by the number of days of reported data.  If 30 or fewer days of expenditures were reported, then the
expenditures were treated as completely missing.  Otherwise, expenditures were imputed based on average prices
within the set of bills for a given building.  Using bills where both consumption and expenditures were reported,
the consumption and the expenditures were summed.  The average price was then calculated as the sum of the
expenditures divided by the sum of the consumption. This average price was multiplied by the reported (or
imputed) consumption to obtain the estimated expenditures.

<p><strong>Discrete-Delivery Energy Source:</strong> The billing dates for fuel oil, a discrete-delivery energy source, are not linked
to the time of consumption.  Thus, the annualized data represent the total deliveries of fuel oil during the year. 
Furthermore, unlike continuous-delivery bills, discrete-delivery bills tend to be irregularly spaced.  Gaps between
bills could represent either missing data or periods during which no deliveries were required.  The completeness
of a set of bills was determined by relying on reports of suppliers.  A set of bills was treated as complete if the
supplier stated that the bills were complete for the year, and treated as missing otherwise, even if a partial set of
bills was available.

<p>Buildings rarely had more than one supplier for a continuous-delivery energy source, such as electricity, but
multiple suppliers for fuel oil occurred frequently.  If data for one or more of several suppliers were missing,
even though responding suppliers had reported all their 1995 deliveries, these buildings were also treated as if no
data were available.

<p>Imputations for both deliveries and expenditures made use of the observed price(s).  An average price, P<sub>x</sub>, for
each set of bills, was computed using the data from billing periods in which both consumption and expenditures
were reported.  If expenditures were missing, the expenditures were imputed as P<sub>x</sub>times the quantity delivered on
date x.  For missing deliveries, the reported expenditures were divided by P<sub>x</sub>to impute the amount delivered.

<p><BR>
<H4>Step 5.  Adjusting for Building Over and Undercoverage</H4>

<p>The annualization procedures for full- and part-year data adjusted for inconsistent time-frame coverage.  After the
nonmissing consumption and expenditures data were annualized, the annual values were adjusted for building
coverage.  Where data were requested from the supplier for a single sampled building, but were provided only for
a group of buildings including the sampled one, or were provided only for a portion of the building, the coverage
adjustment was a simple multiplication of the annualized consumption and expenditures by the disaggregation or
aggregation factor.  As described above under <strong><A Href="ceapp-b.html#ceapp-b6">Step 1</A> </strong>,  this factor was computed by
the survey contractor directly on the basis of information received on the Building or Suppliers Survey.

<p><BR>
<A Name="ceapp-b9"><H4>Step 6.  Imputing for Completely Missing Consumption and Expenditures</H4></a>


<p>In a significant fraction of cases, the energy supplier did not provide the consumption or expenditures data for
some or all billing periods or deliveries in 1995.  Reasons for missing data included energy supplier refusal;
archived, lost, or destroyed billing records; and authorization form refusal on the part of the building respondent. 
In other cases, the energy supplier provided data, but either the building data were combined with those of
nonsampled buildings and could not be disaggregated, or the consumption and/or expenditures were incomplete
enough to be treated as missing.  

<p>The general approach taken to the problem of imputing annual consumption or expenditures was to annualize the
complete or partial sets of bills first, then to use these annualized bills in regression equations to develop imputed
values for the data that were totally missing.  The regression imputation approach was chosen because data from
the Building Characteristics Survey were already available for all of the buildings lacking energy supplier data. 
The first step was the estimation of missing consumption based on characteristics of buildings.  After the
consumption had been imputed, missing expenditures were estimated based on the reported or imputed
consumption.


<p><strong>Completely Missing Consumption:</strong>  Each of the energy sources presented in this report was imputed separately,
although the overall methodology was similar for all.  The consumption imputation method is, therefore,
described in general terms, referring to individual energy sources only where necessary.  The regression equations
were developed primarily to serve as adequate predictors of building consumption based on building
characteristics.  
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The data used to specify regression equations and estimate the regression parameters used for consumption
imputation had to meet several criteria.  Only cases with essentially complete consumption data were used.  For
continuous-delivery energy sources, "essentially complete data" included buildings with 331 to 365 days of
reported consumption; for discrete-delivery energy sources, only buildings with completely reported deliveries
were included.  In addition, cases were not used to estimate regression parameters if the information received
from the energy supplier included too much data from unsampled buildings (before disaggregation), or the datareported from the building respondent was missing key regressor variables.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The development of regression equations began by examining the distributions of the dependent variable,
consumption.  Previous experience showed that the error term associated with the reqression procedure is highly skewed in the positive direction.  Consequently, the regression procedures used for the 1995 CBECS minimized the sum of squares of the difference between the log of the actual consumption and the log of the predicted consumption rather than sum of squares of the difference between the actual consumption and the predicted consumption Accordingly, the imputed consumption values were calculated using parameter values estimated
in two stages:  the initial regression of consumption on building characteristics, and a bias correction.  The
bias correction coefficient was estimated by (1) summing the total actual consumption of cases used to estimate the
regression parameters, (2)  summing the total of the predicted values 
for these same cases, and (3)  dividing the sum of the actual values (1) by the sum of the predicted values (2).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Completely Missing Expenditures:</strong>  Similar to consumption imputations, expenditure imputations were
performed separately for each of the four major fuels, although the overall methodology was similar.  Again, the
imputations are described in general terms, referring to individual energy sources only where necessary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Energy supplier rate schedules are usually structured so that the price per unit of energy is lower as consumption
increases.  The rate schedule is usually a step function with the definition of steps and rates varying by energy
supplier and by rate class.  For the CBECS, rate schedules were not collected for the sampled buildings but many
suppliers did supply an overall rate schedule for their commercial customers.  This was useful in estimating
expenditures.  In cases where rate schedules were not supplied  a statistical procedure was needed to relate the
expenditures to the consumption for imputation purposes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As with the consumption imputations, the data used to specify the form and estimate the parameters of the
expenditure imputation equations had to meet two criteria.  First, only cases with essentially complete
consumption and expenditures were used.  For continuous-delivery energy sources, "essentially complete data"
included buildings with 331 to 365 days of reported data for both consumption and expenditures; for
discrete-delivery energy sources, only buildings with completely reported deliveries and expenditures were
included.  In addition, cases were not used to estimate regressor parameters if the information received from the
supplier included too much data from unsampled buildings before disaggregation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once cases with complete expenditures data were chosen, they were used to develop an ordinary least squares regression equation to relate expenditures to consumption and to the fuel price for commercial customers.  The independent variables were chosen to mimic a decreasing block rate structure.  The resulting fitted equation was used to impute
for cases where expenditures were missing.

<A  NAME="ceapp-b3"><center><H2>Annual Peak Electricity Demand</H2></center></A>



<p>Peak electricity demand data were requested for the same billing periods for which electricity consumption and
expenditures were reported.  Ideally, the metered demand represented the maximum consumption rate (in kW)
during the billing period.  However, two special data problems affect the availability of peak electricity demand
data.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, although virtually all electricity consumption is metered, peak electricity demand is metered where it is
economical to do so.  In general, peak demand meters are only installed for larger consumers of electricity. 
Second, in multicustomer buildings, each customer with a demand meter has its own peak demand.  Since these
peaks would rarely be coincident, the building peak cannot be taken as the sum of individual peaks.  However, the
overall building peak must be greater than or equal to the maximum customer peak.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">



<p>Following <strong><A Href="ceapp-b.html#ceapp-b7">Step 2</A></strong> of "Annual Consumption and Expenditures," the peak electricity demand data was processed in three additional steps:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	
<OL>
<LI>	<strong>Using the billing data, each building was classified as either demand-metered or not demand-metered:</strong> For the 1995 CBECS, a building was considered to be demand-metered if the billing data for any account within the building showed metered peak demand. (The 1989 CBECS obtained demand-metered information from both the building respondent and the energy supplier.  However, there was considerable discrepancy between the two sources of data.  As a result of the building respondent to adequately provide
demand-metered data, subsequent CBECS only obtained this information from the energy supplier.)     
<P>
<LI><strong>The annual peak demand, the season of the peak, and the annual load factor were determined for each building:</strong> For single-account buildings that were determined to be demand-metered, the annual peak demand was taken as the maximum of the billing period peaks.  For the few buildings that had part-year electricity billing data, the annual peak was taken as the maximum of the peaks in the reported billing periods.  This approach results in a slight understatement of the annual peak, because the actual peak may have occurred during one of the unreported periods.  However, since the number of buildings involved
was relatively small, the difference between the part-year and full-year maxima would be small in most cases.
<P>
In multicustomer buildings, the overall building peak demand was not available.  However, the overall peak had to be at least as high as the highest peak reported for any single customer.  In buildings where one customer's peak was substantially larger than that of any other customer, that customer's peak would have been close to the overall peak.  Therefore, in processing bills from multicustomer buildings, the peak demand for any single customer was designated as a "partial peak" (associated with part of the building electricity consumption), although the overall building peak was still treated as missing.  

<p>
Before assigning the peak to a season, the month of the peak was found.  Since the exact time of the billing period peak was unknown, the peak was taken to have occurred in whichever month contained the most days in the billing period during which the peak occurred.  Peaks occurring November through April were  classified as winter peaks, while those occurring May through October were classified as summer peaks.

<P>The annual load factor was then calculated, using previously calculated annual electricity consumption, as follows:
<P>


<img src="ceapp-b.gif" align="left >
<P>



As an edit, the annual load factor was calculated using the partial peak, and the partial peak was set to missing if the load factor was less than .10 or greater than 1.
<P>


<LI><strong>Peak demand and season of peak were imputed for demand-metered buildings missing these data:</strong>Although any electricity consumer has a peak demand, three types of buildings were missing peak demand:(1) buildings determined to be not demand-metered; (2) buildings with completely missing supplier data; (3) multicustomer buildings, and other buildings with partial peaks. No attempt was made to impute for the first type of missing demand, mainly because buildings without demand-metering tended to be smaller than the demand-metered buildings, so that imputation would involve extrapolation beyond the range of the reported data.  Accordingly, tables dealing with peak electricity demand have been limited to buildings with (reported or imputed) demand-metering.  Once the decision was made to exclude buildings that had not been demand-metered, imputation became a two-step process.  First, it was necessary to impute whether the building with missing data was demand-metered.  If the building was imputed to be a demand-metered building, then the peak and season of the peak were imputed. 

<p>			
Imputation of the demand-metering attribute made use of the relationship observed within suppliers between the presence of demand-metering and annual electricity consumption.  Using buildings with reported data, the probability of being a demand-metered building was estimated as a logistic function of the annual consumption.  The parameters estimated from the reported data regression were used to estimate probabilities for each unclassified building, and a uniform random number was generated.  If the random number was less than or equal to the estimated probability, then the building was imputed to be demand-metered.  For buildings imputed to be demand-metered, the season of peak demand was imputed by hot-decking, the same method used to impute missing items from the Building Characteristics Survey.
<P>
Finally, annual load factors were imputed for each building imputed to be demand-metered.  Values were imputed using parameters estimated from a linear regression of the logistic transformation of the annual load factor on various building characteristics (such as weekly operating hours, end uses of electricity, and percent of floorspace heated).  Separate imputation equations were estimated for each of nine principal building activities.  The imputed annual peak demand was then calculated by solving the load factor equation for the annual peak.

<p>
Load factors were imputed, and peak demand values calculated, for multiple-account buildings which had partial peaks .  If the partial peak was less than the imputed peak, then the imputed peak was treated as the buildings' annual peak demand; otherwise, the partial peak was used.

<p>
Load factors and peak intensities were computed for each building reported or imputed to have metered demand.  Also of interest are the analogous ratios over a utility service region, or other large area.  The ratio of a region's consumption to the annual peak for the region as a whole would represent the average utilization of the region's generating capacity.  The ratio of the region's annual peak to the total floorspace in the region would represent the average capacity requirement per square foot.  However, the regional peak cannot be determined from the individual annual (or even monthly) peaks alone, since these peaks are not coincident.  That is, the individual peaks occur at different times, so that the sum of the individual peaks can be considerably greater than the overall regional peak.   HERE

<H3>Energy Sources Used -- Building and Supplier Survey Estimates</H3> 


<p>
As explained in Appendix A, "How the Survey Was Conducted," the CBECS was conducted in two stages.  During
the first stage, the building representative was asked which energy sources were used in the building during 1995. 
In the second stage, the energy suppliers, identified by the building representative during the first stage, were asked
to provide consumption and expenditures data.  In some cases, contacts with the energy suppliers revealed
inaccuracies in the Building Characteristics Survey response as to which energy sources had been used in the
building.  All statistics in this report on energy sources used are based on the final determination made during the
Energy Suppliers Survey.


<p>
When a supplier reported that a particular building was not a customer during 1995, calls were made to the building
respondent to determine the reason for the discrepancy.  In some cases, a different supplier was identified for the
same energy source.  In others, it turned out that the energy source had not actually been used; in some of these
cases, a different energy source was identified instead.  For example, natural gas may have been reported originally,
but the callback determined that natural gas was consumed only in a central plant outside the sampled building,
while the building itself used district steam, which had not been reported originally.  In this case, natural gas would
be coded as "not used in the building," and district steam would be added as "used in the building." The net
discrepancies between the Building Characteristics Survey and Energy Suppliers Survey estimates for the use of
each energy source were small for both the building counts and the floorspace totals.


<p>
The Energy Suppliers Survey was able to correct the energy sources used, only in cases where a supplier had been
misreported as supplying a particular building with an energy source.  If the Building Characteristics Survey
respondent happened to omit an energy supplier, but reported all the other supplier data correctly, the omitted
supplier would not have been discovered.  However, the number of such cases was probably quite small.


<p>
In some cases, a supplier reported that a particular building had been a customer for a given energy source, but not
during calendar year 1995.  For continuous-delivery energy sources (electricity, natural gas, and district heating ),
the building was classified as not using the energy source.  For the discrete-delivery energy source fuel oil, though,
the building was classed as using the energy source, but with zero consumption and expenditures for 1995.  Thus,
for example, those buildings whose respondents reported that fuel oil was used during 1995, but which received no
fuel oil deliveries in that year, were included in the count of buildings and floorspace using fuel oil, though they did
not contribute to the fuel oil delivery total.


<p>
The revised information on the type of energy sources that were used in the building had an impact on the energy
end-use data also.  The Building Characteristics Survey data on the type of energy sources that were used for a
particular end use were collected in concert with the data on energy sources used.  Edit checks on the Building
Characteristics Survey data assured consistency between energy sources reported for end uses and energy sources
reported at all.  However, when the information on energy sources used "at all" was revised during the Energy
Suppliers Survey, no new information was obtained on energy sources used for particular end uses.  As a result,
some energy sources were dropped from a building's list of energy sources used, even though these energy sources
had end uses reported.  Conversely, no associated end uses were coded for energy sources that were added for a
building. For any energy source whose use was changed from "yes" to "no" for a particular building, the use of that
energy source for any given end use was also changed to "no."  However, the end use was still treated as having
been performed in the building.  That is, it was assumed that the building respondent correctly reported, which end
uses were performed, even if the energy source used for the end use had been incorrectly reported.  This approach
left some buildings identified as having a particular end use, but with no energy source indicated for that use.


<p>
All Building Characteristics 1995 tables on the Internet, as well as the Public Use Micro-Data have been updated to
reflect the latest supplier information on the types of fuels used.


<p><BR>
<strong><CENTER><H2>Gas Transported for The Account of Others</H2></CENTER></strong>


<p>
The 1995 CBECS collected data on natural gas transported for the account of others (also referred to as "direct
purchase gas," "spot market gas," or "transportation gas") from both the building respondent and the natural gas
suppliers--both utility suppliers and non-utility suppliers.  Gas transported for the account of others is a type of
purchasing arrangement where large natural gas users purchase their natural gas directly from a source other than
the local distributing company (LDC) or utility.  The LDC then delivers the gas to the building via the local
pipelines.


<p>
The natural gas survey form requested:  (1) the volume of natural gas and expenditures for that gas purchased from
the LDC; (2) the volume of natural gas purchased from a source other than the LDC; (3) delivery charges for gas
purchased from other than the LDC; and (4) total charges for this gas.


<p>
Since local distribution companies know the total volume of natural gas delivered, the total consumption data seem
complete.  (If natural gas consumption was completely missing, then the volume was imputed as described in Step 6
of "Annual Consumption and Expenditures").  The allocation of consumption between transported gas and local
utility-owned gas was then imputed by hot-decking the proportion of gas that was transported gas.  This method
allowed imputed buildings to have both transported and local utility gas, as might happen if (1) building demand
exceeded the direct purchase contract amount or (2) the building switched to or from a direct purchase contract
during the year.


<p>
Estimating consumption and expenditures could become complicated because frequently the LDC filled out the gas
transported for the account of others portion of the supplier form since they knew that the gas being provided was
transportation gas.  Conversely, transportation gas companies, which provide only transported gas did not always
fill in the form correctly.  They often filled in the first available space, which was intended for utility gas only. 
Similar confusion occurred when filling in transported gas expenditures, the LDC would be expected to fill out the
transport charges column but because this was the only expense collected by the LDC, they sometimes filled it in
the "total" column.  Finally, since the same volume of gas was reported by the LDC and the transportation gas
company, double reporting of volumes sometimes occurred.  All these problems were identified by visual inspection
of the appropriate records.

<CENTER><strong><H2>Energy End-Use Intensities</H2></strong>
</CENTER>

<A HREF="cbec-eu3.html">
<strong>The 1995 energy end-use tables </strong></A> provide estimates of the amount of natural gas and electricity  used specifically for nine end uses: space heating; cooling; ventilation, water heating, lighting cooking, refrigeration, office equipment and other.

<p>
The end-use estimates had two main sources of data: (1) survey data collected by the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and (2) building energy simulations provided by the Facility Energy Decision Screening (FEDS) system.  The CBECS provided data on building characteristics and total energy consumption
(i.e., for all end uses) for a national sample of commercial buildings.  Using data collected by the CBECS, the FEDS engineering modules were used to produce estimates of energy consumption by end use.  The FEDS engineering estimates were then statistically adjusted to match the CBECS total energy consumption.

<CENTER><strong><H2>Estimation of Standard Errors</H2></strong></CENTER>



<p>
Sampling error, as described in the introduction to this appendix, is the difference between the survey estimate and
the true population value due to using a random sample to estimate for a population.  This difference arises because
a random subset, rather than the whole population, is observed.  The typical magnitude of the sampling error is
measured by the standard error of the estimate.  The standard error is the root-mean-square difference between the
estimate based on a particular sample and the value that would be obtained by averaging estimates over all possible
samples.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the estimates are unbiased, meaning there is no systematic error, this average over all possible samples is the true
population value.  In this case, the standard error is simply the root-mean-square difference between the survey
estimate and the true population value.  If systematic error is present, however, this bias is not included in the error
measured by the standard error.  Thus, the standard error tends to understate the total estimation error if there are
non-negligible biases.


<p>In principle, random errors can be contributed to the estimate by sources other than the sampling process.  Such
additional sources of random error include random errors by respondents and data entry staff and random unit
nonresponse.  To recognize these additional sources of variation, the definition of the sampling process can be
expanded to include not just the selection of buildings but all steps required to obtain a set of responses.  Under this
expanded definition, all random errors can be regarded as sampling errors.  The procedures designed to estimate the
sampling error for CBECS incorporate all random components of the estimation process.
