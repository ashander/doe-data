<p align="justify" class="style1">CBECS is a national sample survey that collects statistical information on

the consumption of and expenditures for energy in U.S. commercial buildings

along with data on energy-related characteristics of the buildings.  CBECS

is conducted by the Energy Information Administration of the U.S.

Department of Energy.  The first CBECS was conducted in 1979 and then

triennially since 1983.  In the 1995 CBECS, there were 6,590 sampled

buildings of which 5,766 were successfully interviewed.  Energy-related

characteristics of the buildings are obtained in an on-site personal

interview with the building managers, owners or tenants during the

Commercial Buildings Characteristics Survey.  Energy consumption and

expenditures information are obtained from the energy suppliers to the

responding buildings during the Energy Suppliers Survey.  Commercial

buildings are defined as enclosed roofed and walled structures used

predominantly for commercial purposes with floorspace greater than 1,000

square feet.  This definition includes buildings such as schools, health

care buildings, and religious institutions, as well as office buildings 

and retail stores. </p>

    <FONT SIZE=3><B>WHAT ARE THE CBECS PUBLIC USE FILES? </B>
    </FONT>

</span>
<p align="justify" class="style1">The Public Use Files are microdata files that contain 5,766 records, 

representing commercial buildings from the 50 States and the District of

Columbia.  Each record corresponds to a single responding, in-scope sampled

building and contains information for that building about the building

size, year constructed, types of energy used, energy-using equipment,
conservation features, energy consumption and expenditures, and the amount of energy used for nine end uses:  space heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, water heating, cooking, refrigeration, office equipment and other.

    <FONT SIZE=3><B>HOW ARE VARIABLES FROM SEPARATE FILES LINKED?</B>
    </FONT>


</span>
<p align="justify" class="style1">In some instances, a CBECS user may want to undertake analysis that

requires using a variable from several different files.  In those cases,

the files have to be linked to one another.  The common variable on each

file that can be used to merge files is BLDGID6.
</p>

<p><span class="style1"><br>
    <FONT SIZE=3><B>HOW ARE THE VARIABLES THAT BEGIN WITH A Z DIFFERENT FROM THE NON-Z VARIABLES?</B>
    </FONT>

</span>
<p align="justify" class="style1">The "Z variables" are also referred to as "imputation flags." Imputation

is a statistical procedure used to fill in values for missing items.  Many,

but not all, of the variables were imputed in 1995.  The imputation flag

indicates whether the corresponding non-Z variable was reported, imputed,

missing, or inapplicable. </p>

<p><span class="style1"><br>
    <FONT SIZE=3><B>HOW ARE THE SAMPLE DATA WEIGHTED TO ARRIVE AT NATIONAL ESTIMATES?</B> </FONT>


</span>
<p align="justify" class="style1">The CBECS sample was designed so that survey responses could be used to

estimate characteristics of the entire commercial buildings stock

nationwide.  In order to arrive at national estimates from the CBECS

sample,  base sampling weights for each building, which were the reciprocal

of the probability of that building being selected into the sample, were

calculated.  Therefore, a building with a base weight of 1,000 represents

itself and 999 similar, but unsampled buildings in the total building

stock.  The base weight is further adjusted to account for nonresponse

bias.  The variable ADJWT6 in the data file is the adjusted weight.  In

order to obtain a weighted estimate, each sample building's value must be

multiplied by the building's weight.</p>


<p><span class="style1"><br>
    <FONT SIZE=3><B>HOW IS THE SURVEY RESPONDENT'S CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTED?</B></FONT>


</span>
<p align="justify" class="style1">The EIA does not receive nor take possession of the names or addresses of

individual respondents or any other individually identifiable energy data

that could be specifically linked with a building respondent.  All names

and addresses are maintained by the survey contractor for survey

verification purposes only.  Geographic identifiers and National Oceanic

and Atmospheric Administration Weather Division identifiers are not

included on any data files delivered to EIA.  Geographic location

information is provided to EIA at the Census division level.  In addition,

specific building characteristics that could uniquely identify a particular

responding building are masked on any data provided to EIA by the survey

contractor.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style1">  These specific variables that have been modified to protect the

confidentiality of respondents are: </p>


<p align="justify">  <span class="style1"><B>Square Footage:</B>  For buildings over one million square feet, the numeric

 square footage was replaced with the weighted average square footage of  

all responding buildings over one million square feet.  Separate         

 weighted means were calculated for each of the four Census regions.  For

 buildings one million square feet or less, the numeric square footage

 was rounded to within 5 percent of the upper limit of the buildings'     

square footage categories.  If the rounded value fell below the lower

 limit of the category, the value was coded at the lower limit -- for

 example, buildings in the range of 5,001 to 10,000 square feet were

 rounded to the nearest 500 square feet (except that buildings rounding

 to 5,000 were coded as 5,001.)   </span></p>


<p align="justify" class="style1"><B> Number of Workers:</B> For buildings where the numeric number of workers      

 was between 2,500 and 4,999, the reported number was rounded to the

 nearest 250.  For buildings where the numeric number of workers was

 5,000 or more, the reported numeric number of workers was replaced with

  the weighted average number of workers of all responding buildings with

  5,000 or more workers.  Separate weighted means were calculated for each

 of the four Census regions.</p>



<p align="justify" class="style1"><B> Number of Floors:</B> The upper range of the number of floors was replaced  with two categories: 15 to 25 floors (coded as 994 on the file) and over
 25 floors (coded as 995 on the file).</p>


<p align="justify" class="style1"><B>Special Measures of Occupancy:</B>  Seven special measures of occupancy are  included in the 1995 CBECS (seating capacity for religious buildings, public assembly buildings, education buildings, and food service     
buildings; licensed bed capacity for in-patient health care and skilled nursing buildings; and number of guest rooms for lodging buildings).
These numbers were rounded to the following: Fewer than 25 units (no   
rounding performed); 25-49 units (rounded to nearest 5); 50-99 units
(rounded to nearest 10); 100-249 units (rounded to nearest 25); 250-499
(rounded to nearest 50); 500-999 units (rounded to nearest 100);
1,000-2,499 units (rounded to nearest 250); 2,500-4,999 (rounded to
nearest 500); 5,000 or more units (rounded to nearest 1,000).  </p>


<p align="justify">	<span class="style1"><strong>Weather Variables:</strong>  Heating and cooling degree-days (HDD656 and CDD656,
respectively) that have a base 65 degrees Fahrenheit are included on the data files for each
building.  The heating degree-day variable has been inflated or deflated by a random
percentage, normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation of 2.0.  The files
also include annual mean (TEMPAVG6) and standard deviation (TEMPSTD6) of daily
average temperatures. for each building.  The mean and standard deviation of temperature
and the base 65 degrees Fahrenheit cooling degree-days have been modified to be
consistent with the modified heating degree-days. </span></p>

    <FONT SIZE=3>
    <strong>SPECIAL NOTES</strong></font>
</span>
<p align="justify">	<span class="style1"><strong>Reporting Period Shifts: </strong> For energy consumption and expenditures, EIA requested that
energy suppliers provide data covering the period from December 1994 through January
31, 1996.  However, some suppliers were unable to provide data for this period.
Therefore, for electricity, natural gas, and district energy sources (steam and hot water), 
variables are included in the file to indicate reporting period shifts.  A negative value
indicates the number of days that the period was shifted back into 1994, and a positive
value indicates the number of days shifted forwarded into 1996.  A zero indicates that the
data represent calendar year 1995.</span></p>


<p align="justify">	<span class="style1"><strong>Energy End-Use Estimation Methodology:</strong>  The end-use estimates had two main
sources: (1) survey data collected by the CBECS and (2) building energy simulations
provided by the Facility Energy Decision Screening (FEDS) system.  The CBECS
provided data on building characteristics and total energy consumption, for all end uses,
for a national sample of commercial buildings, Using data collected by the CBECS, the
FEDS engineering modules were used to produce estimates of energy consumption by
end use.  The engineering estimates were then statistically adjusted to match the CBECS
total energy consumption. (For more methodological detail see  <a href= "https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cbec-eu2.html"><strong>End-Use Estimation
