The <I>Federal Buildings Supplemental Survey 1993</I> provides building-level energy-related
characteristics for a special sample of commercial buildings owned by the Government. 
Extensive analysis of the data was not conducted because this report represents the 881
responding buildings (buildings for which interviews were completed) and cannot be used to
generalize about Federal buildings in each region.  Crosstabulations of the data from the 881
buildings are provided in the Detailed Tables section.
<UL>
<Li>      <FONT SIZE=4>Energy Consumption:</FONT> In FY 1993, the 881 responding
Federal commercial buildings in Federal Regions 3, 6, and 9 consumed about 22 trillion Btu of
electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat (Table 2.1).<P> 
<Li>      <FONT SIZE=4>Energy Expenditures:</FONT>  Expenditures for the 22 trillion Btu
of energy consumed in the sampled Federal commercial buildings totaled about $308 million
dollars (Table 2.1).<P> 

<Li>      <FONT SIZE=4>Energy Intensity:</FONT>   The major fuel energy consumption
intensity was 125.79 (thousand Btu per square foot) for the 881 buildings (Table 2.1).<P>

<Li>      <FONT SIZE=4>Principal Building Activity:</FONT>  Principal building activity, the
activity that occupies the most floorspace in the building, indicates the diversity of the Federal
commercial building population.  In the 881 responding buildings in Federal Regions 3, 6, and 9,
office buildings accounted for the greatest number of buildings, 33 percent and about 48 percent
of the floorspace.  Although health care buildings were  only about 14 percent of the buildings in
the sample, they constituted 21 percent of the floorspace (Table 3.7).<P>  
<Li>      <FONT SIZE=4>Selected Characteristics by Agency:</FONT>  In a commercial
building, building size and number of workers impact the consumption, expenditures and the
associated energy intensities.  Table 2.1 provides these data on an agency level.  In FY 1993, of
the total Federal expenditures for major fuel consumption in the 881 responding buildings in
Federal Regions 3, 6, and 9 ($308 million), the General Services Administration (GSA) spent
about $122 million.  Overall, the GSA consumed about 33 percent of the total energy consumed
in the sampled buildings in Federal Regions 3, 6, and 9 in FY 1993.  The Veterans
Administration was the next largest consumer of energy among the participating FBSS agencies.
