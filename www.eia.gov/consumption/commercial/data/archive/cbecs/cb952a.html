<P>

In 1995, there were 4.6 (+ or -0.4) million commercial buildings containing 58.8 (+ or -3.9) billion square feet of floorspace in the
United States, as estimated by the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS).  The CBECS is a national sample
survey of commercial buildings and their energy suppliers.  The 1995 CBECS was the sixth survey in the series, begun in 1979.

<P>

The survey is conducted in two stages, the Building Characteristics Survey and the Energy Suppliers Survey.  The first collects
information by personal interview on physical characteristics of the building, building use and occupancy patterns, major
equipment used, conservation practices, and types and uses of energy sources in the buildings.  The suppliers survey (a mail survey), collects
information on amounts and costs of energy delivered to the building during the 1995 survey year.

<P>  

The target population for the 1995 CBECS consisted of all commercial buildings in the United States with more than 1,000 square
feet of floorspace.  A commercial building is defined by CBECS as an enclosed structure with more than 50 percent of its
floorspace devoted to activities that are neither residential, industrial, nor agricultural.  The sample of eligible commercial
buildings contained 6,590 buildings, of these, interviews were completed at 5,766 for a response rate of 88 percent.

<P>


The estimates in the data tables are based on the sample surveyed and are subject to sampling error.  Variability occurs in survey statistics because the different samples that could be drawn from the population of commercial buildings would each produce different values for the survey statistics.  Thus the apparent difference between any two estimates may not be statistically significant because of the variance associated with each estimate.  Care should be taken when making comparisons with the estimates presented in the data tables.  See <B>Statistical Significance of Data</B> section below for a discussion of relative standard errors (RSE) and how they can be used to construct confidence intervals for the estimates.


<P>The commercial building population sampled in 1995 differed from that sampled in previous CBECS.  Two types of buildings were excluded that had previously been included; parking garages and commercial buildings located on multibuilding manufacturing facilities.  Because of this change, estimates of the number of buildings or the amount of floorspace in the 1995 CBECS cannot be directly compared with earlier CBECS.  1989 and 1992 adjusted estimates of the number of buildings and square footage are addressed in the <EM>Commercial Buildings Characteristics 1995</EM> report.

</CENTER><P>
This set of detailed tables contains the number of buildings and amount of floorspace for major  building characteristics, energy
sources, and energy end uses.  Tables 1 and 2 are summary tables, while Tables 3 to 17 address location, building size, year
constructed, number of workers, hours of operation, and types of occupancy.  Energy sources used for all end uses and for specific
major end uses are addressed in Tables 18 to 28. Tables 29 through 32 address the percent of floorspace heated, cooled, and lit.  Tables 33 through 40 are energy-using equipment tables. Tables 41 through 44 are conservation tables.

<DT>
<strong>Mean:</strong>              The simple average for a population characteristic that is the sum of all the values in a population divided by the size of the population.  For example, mean square feet per building is the total  floorspace divided by the total number of buildings.

<P><BR>
<H3>Standard Errors and Relative Standard Errors</H3>

The tables present estimates of number of buildings and floorspace for commercial buildings in the United States.  Because the estimates are based on the sample
surveyed, they are subject to sampling error.  The standard error is a measure of the reliability or precision of the survey statistic. 
The value for the standard error can be used to construct confidence intervals and to perform hypothesis tests by standard
statistical methods.  Relative Standard Error (RSE) is defined as the standard error (square root of the variance) of a survey
estimate, divided by the survey estimate and multiplied by 100.
<P>
An approximate RSE can be computed for each estimate in these tables via the use of row and column factors.  The RSE for a
given estimate is found by multiplying the RSE Row Factor (located in the last column) for the estimate by its RSE Column Factor
(at the top of the column).  This value is the approximate RSE, in percent.  The RSE (divided by 100 and multiplied by the estimate) is the approximate standard error.
<P>
The 95-percent confidence range can be determined with the approximate RSE.  To calculate the 95-percent confidence range for a given estimate:
<OL>
<Li> Multiply the RSE row factor by the RSE column factor to determine the approximate RSE.

<Li> Multiply the approximate RSE (divided by 100) by the estimate in the table to determine the approximate standard
         error.

<Li>Multiply the approximate standard error by 1.96 to determine the approximate confidence error.

<Li> The estimate plus or minus the confidence error is the 95-percent confidence range.
</OL><P>
For example, the estimate for the total number of commercial buildings in the 1995 CBECS is 4.579 million buildings (Table 1),
the  estimate's RSE row factor is 3.2, and its RSE column factor is 1.3.  The approximate RSE is (3.2)x(1.3) or 4.2 percent.  The
approximate standard error is (4.2/100)x(4.579 million buildings) or 0.192 million buildings.  The 95-percent confidence error
is (1.96)x(0.192 million buildings) or 0.377 million buildings.  Therefore, with 95 percent confidence, the true number of
commercial buildings in the United States, in 1995, was 4.579 (+ or - 0.377) million buildings or the range  4.202 to 4.956 million
buildings.<BR>
