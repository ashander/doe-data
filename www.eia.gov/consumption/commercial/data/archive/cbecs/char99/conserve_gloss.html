<h4><font face="arial">HVAC Conservation Features</font></h4>
<p>
<b>Economizer Cycle:</b> A heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) conservation feature consisting of indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity sensors, dampers, motors, and motor controls for the ventilation system to reduce the air-conditioning load. Wherever the temperature and humidity of the outdoor air are more favorable (lower heat content) than the temperature and humidity of the return air, more outdoor air is brought into the building.</p>

<p>
<b>Energy Management and Control System (EMCS):</b> An energy management feature that uses mini/microcomputers, instrumentation, control equipment, and software to manage a building's use of energy for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, and/or business-related processes. These systems may also manage fire control, safety, and security. Not included as an EMCS are time-clock thermostats.</p>

<p>
<b>HVAC Maintenance:</b> An HVAC conservation feature consisting of a program of routine inspection and service for heating and/or cooling equipment. The inspection is performed on a regular basis, even if there are no apparent problems.</p>

<p>
<b>Variable Air-Volume (VAV) System:</b> An HVAC conservation feature usually referred to as &#147;VAV&#148; that supplies varying quantities of conditioned (heated or cooled) air to different parts of a building according to the heating and cooling needs of those specific areas.</p>

<h4><font face="arial">Building Shell Conservation Features</font></h4>

<p>
<b>Multipaned Windows:</b> A building shell conservation feature consisting of double- or triple-pane glass that are placed on the exterior of the building to reduce the rate of heat loss. Included are sliding glass doors made of double glass or of insulating glass, such as thermopane, double- or triple-pane glass.</p>

<p>
<b>Tinted or Reflective Glass, or Shading Glass:</b> A building shell conservation feature that consists of tinted or reflective glass or shading films installed on the exterior glazing of a building to reduce the rate of solar penetration into the building.</p>

<a name="light"></a>
<h4><font face="arial">Lighting Conservation Features</font></h4>

<p>
<b>Electronic Ballasts:</b> A lighting conservation feature that consists of an energy-efficient electronic version of a conventional electromagnetic ballast. The ballast is the transformer for fluorescent and high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps and provides the necessary current, voltage, and wave-form conditions to operate the lamp. An electronic ballast requires lower power input than a conventional ballast to operate HID and fluorescent lamps.</p>

<p>
<b>Skylights or Atriums:</b> Skylights are openings in a roof covered with translucent or transparent material such as glass or plastic and specifically designed for admission of light. An atrium is a multi-storied central courtyard.</p>

<p>
<b>Specular Reflectors:</b> A lighting conservation feature that is the mirror-like backing of a fluorescent lighting fixture designed specifically to reflect light into the room. The materials and shape of the reflector are designed to reduce absorption of light within the fixture, while delivering light in the desired angular pattern. The most common materials used are silver (highest reflectivity) and aluminum (lowest cost).</p>
