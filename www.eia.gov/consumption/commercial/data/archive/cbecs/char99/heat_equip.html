<font face="times new roman"><font size="+2" ><b>T</b></font>he total amount of floorspace in heated commercial buildings was 61,602 million square feet (or 91 percent of 67,338 million square feet, the total amount of floorspace in all commercial buildings). However, within heated buildings, not all of the floorspace  was actually heated. A total of 53,812 million square feet was heated (87 percent of the floorspace in heated buildings, and 80 percent of the floorspace in all buildings).</p>
<p>
The total amount of floorspace in heated buildings ranged from 25,743 million square feet for buildings that used packaged heating units to 5,534 million square feet for those with district heat systems (Figure 1). Within buildings with packaged units, 22,846 million square feet (or 89 percent of the total floorspace of those buildings) was actually heated. In buildings that used other systems, the percentage of heated floorspace ranged from 82 percent for those that used furnaces, to 96 percent for those with district heating.</p>

Buildings that used boilers or district heat systems were significantly larger than the average of all heated buildings (Figure 2). Buildings with boilers had an average of 33,600 square feet of total floorspace and those with district heat an average of 57,600 square feet.</p>

<p>Packaged heating units and boilers were the most widely used types of heating equipment for both main use and total use (Figure 3). Individual space heaters were widely used, but they used for main heating for only 25 percent of the floorspace heated by those units, i.e., the heaters were often used for secondary heating. In contrast, nearly all (94 percent) of the floorspace heated by district heat systems was for main use.</p>
