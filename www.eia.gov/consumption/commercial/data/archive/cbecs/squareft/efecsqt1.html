<P><CENTER><H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>O</FONT>ne of the major approaches to analyzing energy use in end-use sectors is to relate energy use to measures of the extent of utilization of the sector, either in absolute terms or in
terms relative to some maximum utilization level. For example, vehicle miles traveled is a
measure of vehicle utilization in the transportation sector.  The percent of maximum
production capability at which an industry or an individual plant is operating is a measure
of industrial capacity utilization in the  industrial sector. 


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>F</FONT>or the commercial buildings sector, two concepts that measure how intensely a building is utilized  seem to predominate: the number of hours the building is in operation and the amount of floorspace in the building that is occupied (or conversely, the amount that is
vacant). 

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>T</FONT>he <STRONG><FONT  COLOR=#000068>Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)</FONT></STRONG>, a national sample survey of commercial buildings, has collected information since 1979 on how energy is used in commercial buildings.  Because the amount of energy used in a building is closely related to building characteristics such as the building's size,  operating hours and how the building is used, the CBECS also collects information about these characteristics. For more information see the <A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/cb951a.html"><STRONG>building characteristics.</strong></A> 


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>H</FONT>istorically, CBECS has measured operating hours in some detail, but has provided less detail about the amount of occupied and vacant floorspace in commercial buildings. <STRONG> <A HREF="efecsqt1.html#measures">Two primary measures</A></STRONG>  have been used to estimate occupied and
vacant floorspace in the CBECS.  However, with the exception of the 1992 CBECS, these
two measures are based on building-level classification of vacancy, and do not provide
sufficient detail needed to calculate the more precise measures of <EM>effective</EM> occupied space
and <EM>effective</EM> vacant space.  These measures account for the portion of floorspace in an
occupied building that is vacant and the portion of floorspace in a vacant building that is
occupied.</P>

<A NAME="one"></A>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>T</FONT>o address this issue, <A HREF="efecsqt1.html#details"><STRONG> more detailed information</STRONG></A> on occupied and vacant floorspace was collected in the 1992 CBECS.  Using this more detailed
information, approximately, 9 percent of all floorspace in commercial buildings was
determined to be vacant in 1992 <STRONG><A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/squareft/sqtab_1a.html">(Table 1a)</A>. </STRONG>  

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>A</FONT>lthough this number does not vary much by building characteristics, some building types did show notably high or low vacancy rates.  Office buildings and health care buildings had the greatest amount of vacant floorspace, with approximately 14 percent of their
respective floorspace vacant.  Buildings where the primary activity was religious worship
or public order and safety had the least amount of vacant floorspace.  Only 2 percent of
the floorspace in these types of buildings was vacant (Figure 1).  In addition, buildings
with ten or more floors had a relatively large percent of vacant floorspace during 1992 (18
percent). (Figure 2). 

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>O</FONT>ther building categories with a relatively large percentage of vacant floorspace were buildings that were not heated (28 percent of floorspace), cooled (18 percent of
floorspace) or lit (70 percent of floorspace).  It is reasonable to assume that building
managers do not want to pay for utilities for the portions of the building that are vacant.

<P><CENTER><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3 COLOR="#000068">Amount of Electricity Consumed in Effective Occupied and Vacant Commercial Building Floorspace</font></STRONG></CENTER>


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>T</FONT>he average measure of effective occupied and vacant floorspace is useful not only to characterize building occupancy, but also to measure the intensity of energy use, since
CBECS collects energy use for a calendar year.  Ideally, the way to measure energy
intensity would be to separate building energy use into two parts, (1) the energy used in
occupied floorspace, and (2) the energy used in vacant floorspace, and calculate intensities
specific to each.  However, CBECS collects energy consumption only for the building as a
whole, and there is no known way to separate it by occupancy/vacancy rates.  Therefore,
the only way, currently, to determine consumption in vacant floorspace is to analyze
consumption in buildings that were completely vacant during 1992.  This analysis is
possible for electricity because it is consumed in virtually all buildings, even those that are
totally vacant. (A description of the methodology used to <A HREF="efecsqt1.html#calculate"><STRONG>calculate electricity consumption</STRONG></A> in vacant buildings.

<A NAME="two"></A>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>I</FONT>n 1992, approximately 8 thousand Btu of electricity was consumed per vacant square foot in buildings that were totally vacant but still had some electricity supplied to them <STRONG><A HREF="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/archive/cbecs/squareft/sqtab_2a.html">(Table 2a)</A>.</STRONG> These intensities varied by building type:  vacant office buildings were the most energy intensive, using about 15 thousand Btu of electricity per vacant square foot; vacant mercantile and service buildings were the least intensive, using 3 thousand Btu of electricity per vacant square foot.


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>I</FONT>f these intensities are applied to all vacant commercial floorspace in both totally vacantand partially occupied CBECS buildings, electricity consumption can be estimated for all
floorspace identified as vacant by the 1992 CBECS.  (This process assures that electricity
intensity for vacant floorspace in otherwise occupied buildings is the same as its intensity
in buildings that were completely vacant during the year, an uncertain equivalence, but the
best assumption that can be made.)  Then, subtracting this value from total electricity
consumption for the sector yields an estimate of electricity consumption specific to
occupied floorspace.  Finally, dividing the consumption for occupied floorspace by the
effective occupied square footage gives an estimate of electricity intensity specific to
occupied floorspace.


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>A</FONT>pproximately 42 thousand Btu of electricity was consumed per occupied square foot in 1992.  the amount of electricity used per occupied square foot ranged from 116 thousand
Btu in buildings classified as food sales and service to 8 thousand Btu in buildings where
the primary activity was  religious worship.

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>F</FONT>or three other energy sources, natural gas, fuel oil and district heat, there were too few completely vacant buildings during 1992 that still had these energy sources supplied to
them, to be able to estimate the amount of energy consumed in vacant buildings as a
surrogate for the energy intensity specific to vacant floorspace.  Therefore, the only
occupancy-related intensity measure that can be provided for these energy sources is <STRONG><A HREF="efecsqt1.html#square foot measure">total consumption per effective square foot</A></STRONG> This measure has a meaning of its own.  It can be thought of as the amount of energy needed per unit of productive commercial space, with vacant square footage treated as nonproductive space.

<A NAME="measures"></A><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3 COLOR="#000068">Two Primary Measures</FONT></STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>I</FONT>n most CBECS, the issue of occupied or vacant floorspace is measured in two ways.  The first way is through building activity classification questions.  A  building is classified
as vacant at the time of the survey if the largest single proportion of the building's square
footage is vacant. Otherwise, the building is classified as occupied, with the building
activity being the one that takes up the largest proportion of floorspace. In many cases a
building has either a single activity, or multiple activities that account for 100% of its
floorspace. However, it is often the case that a building classified as vacant has some
occupied square footage; and conversely, many buildings classified in an occupied activity
category have some vacant space.

<P>

<FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>T</FONT>here are two major problems with measuring vacancy rates based solely on building activity classification.  First, the actual amount of vacant floorspace in buildings may
differ greatly from the amount of floorspace in buildings classified as vacant depending on the amount of vacant space in buildings classified as occupied, and the amount of occupied space in buildings classified as vacant.


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>F</FONT>or example, if a building population has an estimated 92 percent of floorspace in buildings classified as occupied, and 8 percent of floorspace classified as vacant, and if
the occupied buildings are on average, 95 percent occupied at the time of the survey, and
the vacant buildings are, on average, 90 percent vacant, then the actual proportion of
vacant space in the population at the time of the survey would be estimated as:

<P> 

<DD>      V = (0.92)(0.05) + (0.08)(0.90) = 0.046 + 0.072 = 0.118, or 11.8 percent
</DD>


<P>a value almost 50 percent larger than the 8 percent that is classified as vacant using only
the building activity classification. 


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>A</FONT> second problem associated with using floorspace in vacant buildings as a surrogate for vacant floorspace is that the CBECS is ordinarily conducted in the fall of the year. If
vacancy rates in commercial buildings vary by season, then even the demonstrably flawed
measure of floorspace in vacant buildings may itself be biased relative to its true value
over time. Thus, the activity status measure is uncertain at best as a measure of the amount
of vacancy in buildings.


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>A</FONT> second way occupied and vacant floorspace is measured is through a question that asks whether any space in a sample building was vacant for at least 3 consecutive months
during the past year. However, that question alone does not specify the proportion vacant
or the time period of the vacancy, and so is not adequate by itself as a measure of the
"amount" of vacancy found in a building.
</UL>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="details"></A><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3 COLOR="#000068">More Details on Occupied and Vacant Floorspace</FONT></STRONG>
<P>


<UL>

<LI><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>I</FONT>n the 1992 CBECS an effort was made to more precisely characterize building occupancy in order to produce a directly-measured value of the amount of vacancy in
commercial buildings that would not be subject to seasonal bias.  Survey respondents
were asked to estimate, month by month during 1992,  the percentage of building
floorspace that was vacant. 


<P>

<DD>Calculation of Effective Occupied Square Footage</DD>



<P><EM>Effective</EM> occupied square footage was calculated in two different ways, depending on
whether or not some portion of the building was vacant for 3 consecutive months. 


      <P><STRONG><font size="3">Buildings with Three Consecutive Months of Vacancy</font></STRONG> 
      <P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#0000FF>I</FONT>f some parts of a building were vacant for 3 consecutive months, then the percentage of the floorspace that was vacant each month of the year was obtained. To calculate <EM>effective</EM>
occupied square footage, the percent vacant for each month was: (1) summed over all 12
months; (2) divided by 12; and (3) rounded to the nearest integer.  This number was
subtracted from 100 to get the percent occupied.  The total occupied square footage is the
percent occupied, multiplied by the total floorspace.  Buildings reporting 3 consecutive
months of vacancy comprised about 18 percent of the population of commercial buildings.

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#0000FF>T</FONT>his average, while it may not represent the amount of occupied or vacant floorspace of the building at any particular time of the year, is the best measure of the average over the
year.

<P><BR><STRONG>Buildings Not Reporting Three Consecutive Months of Vacancy</STRONG>


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#0000FF>B</FONT>uildings not reporting 3 consecutive months of vacancy accounted for about 82 percent of all commercial buildings. The occupied square footage in these buildings is equal to the
total square footage of the building.  <STRONG>Note: </STRONG>The total square footage is an overestimate of occupied square footage for these buildings, because a portion of the buildings will have
sections vacant for short periods of time, even though nothing was vacant for 3
consecutive months. However, it is likely that this overestimate is relatively small. For
example, if the buildings represented 76 percent of floorspace, and the average building
had 10 percent of its floorspace vacant for 1 month during the year, the ignored proportion
of vacant floorspace is (0.76)(0.1)(1/12)=0.6 percent of total floorspace.

    for Calculating Electricity Consumption in Vacant Buildings</FONT></STRONG> 
  <P>
<UL>

<LI><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>T</FONT>o calculate the electricity consumption per effective vacant floorspace buildings had to meet three criteria: (1) the principal building activity was classified as vacant; (2)
electricity was supplied to the building during 1992; and (3) the buildings were not
occupied at all during the year. There were 88 of these buildings in the sample.  The
buildings were then divided into three groups based on their previous or intended
use--office buildings, mercantile and service, and all other. Given the data limitations,
computing consumption in vacant buildings that are intended to be offices, for example, is
the closest to computing electricity consumption in vacant floorspace in office buildings. 


<P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>T</FONT>he electricity consumption in vacant square footage is the electricity intensities as calculated above, multiplied by the vacant floorspace in each building category. The
electricity consumption in occupied floorspace is the total consumption minus the
consumption in vacant floorspace.  The intensities for vacant and occupied square footage
are equal to the respective consumption divided by the vacant and occupied square
footage totals.

    <LI> <FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>E</FONT>nergy consumption per occupied floorspace 
      for natural gas, fuel oil and district heat is obtained by summing the energy 
      consumption in each building and dividing it by the total occupied square 
      footage. The resulting figure is the number of Btu (in thousands) consumed 
      per occupied square foot. However, for any building with any vacant floorspace, 
      this number will necessarily be higher than the energy intensity that is 
      calculated using total square footage, because the denominator is smaller. 
      Thus, building categories with the highest percentage of effective vacant 
      floorspace show the largest differences between the energy intensities calculated 
      using total square footage as a denominator and the energy intensities calculated 
      using the effective occupied square footage as a denominator. 
      <P><FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#000068>W</FONT>hen electricity consumption is calculated 
        in the same way as natural gas, fuel oil and district heat (i.e. relative 
        to occupied square footage rather than total square footage), there is

        square foot.
