<CENTER><H2>Table Organization</H2></CENTER>



The following 13 tables present detailed energy end-use consumption data from the 1989

CBECS. Summary tables for all major fuels (electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district heat)

appear first, followed by separate tables for each of the four major fuels. Within each energy

source’s group of tables, there is a table showing end-use consumption, a table showing

end-use intensities (consumption per square foot), and a table (except for fuel oil and district

heat) showing the end-use shares of total consumption.<P>



In the major fuels end-use intensity table, the intensity denominator is total commercial building

floorspace. In the energy source-specific intensity tables, the intensity denominator is the total

floorspace of all commercial buildings receiving that specific energy source.


<p><BR>


<CENTER><H2>Row Stubs</H2></CENTER>

There is a standard set of row categories (stubs), which appears in all the summary tables.

Depending on the specific table topic, the standard stub may be augmented with selected

variables pertinent to that topic. The standard stub items always appear in the same order, with

any additional stub items interspersed adjacent to the related standard stub items.<P>



There are two types of row stubs, those that divide commercial buildings into exclusive,

nonoverlapping categories and those that indicate nonexclusive, overlapping subsets. For

example, "Climate Zone" is a set of exclusive categories; a given building belongs in only one of

these. "Energy Sources," on the other hand, is a set of nonexclusive categories; a given building

may be represented in more than one line under this stub, because the building may use more

than one energy source. The phrase "Solely or in Combination" indicates that the categories

under this row header are overlapping. Both exclusive and overlapping categories may be

nonexhaustive; that is, there may be some buildings that do not fall into any of the listed

categories.

<CENTER><H2>Relative Standard Errors</H2></CENTER>

Sampling error is inherent in any CBECS estimates, because the estimates are based on a

relatively small sample randomly chosen to represent a large and variable population. Sampling

errors are random differences between the survey estimate and the population value that occur

because of the particular sample that was selected by chance. The average sampling error,

averaged over all possible samples, would be zero. Although the sampling error is nonzero and

unknown for the particular sample chosen, the sample design permits sampling errors to be

estimated.<P>



Due to the complexity of the sample design, the CBECS uses a jackknife replication method

(with 40 collapsed strata) for variance estimation. To capture variation due to unit nonresponse,

weight adjustment is performed separately within each replicate, as well as overall. The 40 sets

of replicate weights are used to compute mean square errors about the full-sample point

estimates.<P>



The relative standard error (RSE) is the square root of the mean square error, expressed as a

percent of the estimate. The RSE’s which are displayed in the far-right columns of most tables

are based only on the total energy consumption or intensity estimates only. No RSE estimates

are provided for energy end-use estimates, since the end-use breakdown of total fuel

consumption is completely modeled. For these derived estimates, the uncertainty of the

engineering assumptions is generally greater than the sampling error. The RSE’s for end-use

energy are at least as large as that for the total fuel consumption. For more details about the

derivation of the row and column RSE factors, see Appendix B, "Nonsampling and Sampling

Errors," of the 1989 CBECS data reports.[1,2]
