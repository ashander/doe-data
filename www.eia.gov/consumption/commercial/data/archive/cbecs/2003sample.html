          <P align=justify><span class="SubSection">The 
          Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) is conducted 
          quadrennially by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to provide 
          basic statistical information about energy consumption and expenditures 
          in U.S. commercial buildings and information about energy-related characteristics 
          of these buildings. The survey is based upon a sample of commercial 
          buildings selected according to the sample design requirements described 
          below. A “building,” as opposed to an “establishment,” is the basic 
          unit of analysis for the CBECS because the building is the energy-consuming 
          unit.&nbsp; The 2003 CBECS was the eighth survey  conducted 
          since 1979 </span>
          <P align=justify class="SubSection">The 
          CBECS is conducted in two data-collection stages: a Building Characteristics 
          Survey and an Energy Suppliers Survey.&nbsp; The Energy Suppliers Survey 
          is initiated only if the respondents to the Building Characteristics 
          Survey can not provide the energy consumption and expenditures information, 
          or the information provided fails edits within the survey instrument. 
          The Building Characteristics Survey collects information about selected 
          commercial buildings through voluntary interviews with the buildings’ 
          owners, managers, or tenants.&nbsp; In the 2003 survey, these data were 
          collected using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) techniques.</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">During 
          the Building Characteristics Survey, respondents are asked questions 
          about the building size, how the building is used, types of energy-using 
          equipment and conservation measures that are present in the building, 
          the types of energy sources used, and the amount and cost of energy 
          used in the building.</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">Upon 
          completion of the Building Characteristics Survey, the Energy Suppliers 
          Survey is initiated for those cases that did not provide satisfactory 
          consumption and expenditures information. This Suppliers Survey obtains 
          data about the building’s actual consumption of and expenditures for 
          energy from records maintained by energy suppliers.&nbsp; These billing 
          data are collected in a mail survey conducted under EIA’s mandatory 
          data collection authority. A survey research firm, under contract to 
          EIA, conducts both the interviews for the Building Characteristics Survey 
          and the mail survey for the Energy Suppliers Survey.</P>

        <P class="CategoryTitle">Target Population 
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">The 
          target population for the 2003 CBECS consisted of all commercial buildings 
          in the United States (with the exception of commercial buildings located 
          on manufacturing sites) that were were larger than 1,000 square feet.</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">To 
          be eligible for the survey, a building had to satisfy three criteria: 
          (1) it had to meet the size criteria described above; (2) it had to 
          meet the survey’s definition of a building; and (3) it had to be used 
          primarily for some commercial purpose.&nbsp; To be considered a building 
          for CBECS, a structure must be totally enclosed by walls that extend 
          from the foundation to the roof and must be intended for human access. 
          To be used primarily for some commercial purpose, the building must 
          have more than 50 percent of its floorspace devoted to activities that 
          are neither residential, industrial, nor agricultural. The 2003 CBECS 
          estimated that there were 4,859 thousand buildings 
          in the target population.</P>
        <P><BR>
          <span class="CategoryTitle">2003 CBECS Sample </span>          <P align=justify class="SubSection">The 
          sample of commercial buildings for the 2003 CBECS was selected by a 
          multistage area probability sample supplemented by a sample of buildings 
          drawn from various special list frames within the primary sampling units 
          (PSUs). A new sample of PSUs, which were counties or group of counties, 
          was selected. For the area sample, a sample of secondary sampling units 
          (SSUs), composed of U.S. Census Bureau tracts, was selected within the 
          PSUs. Some of the large SSUs were divided into segments, which were 
          composed of Census Bureau block-groups. In these large SSUs, one segment 
          was selected from each SSU. Lists of all commercial buildings in each 
          of the sampled segments were prepared by field listing. Building size 
          and use classes, based on observation, were assigned by the listers 
          to each listed building. The buildings were selected from these field 
          lists by overall sampling rates that varied by the size and use class 
          of the building.</P>
        <p align="justify" class="SubSection">The 
          basic area probability sample design was supplemented by list samples 
          of large buildings in each PSU to improve the precision of energy consumption 
          estimates. The list supplementation was designed to give the larger 
          buildings (those with 200,000 square feet or more) more nearly optimum 
          probabilities of selection for estimating aggregate statistics correlated 
          with square footage. The list samples were selected within the sample 
          PSUs from special lists of Federal Government buildings, colleges, universities, 
          hospitals, large office buildings, and other types of commercial buildings. 
          The buildings from these lists were also selected by overall sampling 
          rates that varied by the size and use class of the building. Special 
          subsampling procedures were used to reduce respondent burden on campuses 
          and in shopping centers.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="CategoryTitle" >Shopping 
          Mall Procedures        </p>
        <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">A 
          major change for the 2003 CBECS was the implementation of subsampling establishments within strip shopping centers of enlcosed malls, and subsequently conducting  separate interviews 
          in these establishments. In the past, an attempt was made to administer an interview  for each mall as a whole. The new procedure was implemented to improve the quality of data for 
          shopping centers and malls because interviewers learned from previous 
          CBECS cycles that it is difficult to find a respondent who has overall 
          knowledge about these buildings as a whole. 
        </span>
        <P align="justify"><span class="SubSection">At their first visit to  
          each sampled shopping center or mall, interviewers listed each establishment along with a very general category of the type of business; the list was faxed to the survey contractor, where up to three establishments were subsampled; a list of selected establishments was returned to the 
          interviewer, and interviews were attempted. This establishment data 
          will be aggregated to the shopping center or mall level for published 
          reports.
Shopping 
          center or mall cases were considered to be complete as long as the list 
        of establishments was complete.&nbsp;
        </span>          <P class="CategoryTitle"> Sample 
          Size</P>
         
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">A 
          sample of 6,955 potential building cases was selected (including mall buildings 
          but not the individual establishment cases), consisting of 6,120 buildings 
          from the area sample frame and 835 buildings from the special list frames. Of these 6,955 buildings, 6,380 were found to be eligible for interviewing.</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">For establishments within malls, a sample of 880 was selected, comprised of 768 establishments from the area sample and 112 from the list sample. All of these were eligible for interviewing. </P>
        <P align=justify class="CategoryTitle">Response Rates 
              
      </P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">These 
          procedures resulted in 5,215 completed building interviews for a response rate 
          of 82 percent. This total included 4,683 buildings from the area 
          sample and 532 buildings from the special list samples.</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">A total of 668 establishment interviews were completed, for a response rate of 76 percent.</P>
        <P align=justify class="CategoryTitle">Unit Nonresponse</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">An 
            in-scope sample building, otherwise eligible for interview, for which 
            no information is obtained, is called a unit nonresponse. The principal 
            cause of the 18 percent unit nonresponse among buildings in the 2003 CBECS was the respondent’s 
            refusal to participate in the interview (60 percent).&nbsp; The second largest reason 
            for nonresponse was the inability to contact and interview someone knowledgeable 
            about the building (31 percent). The remaining 9 percent included a few cases where the respondent did not speak English, 
            buildings that were incorrectly identified during the interview, and 
            miscellaneous other reasons.</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">Among establishments, 44 percent were refusals and 41 percent were establishments where the correct person was unable to be contacted during the field period. The rate of nonresponse cases where the respondent spoke a language other than English was notably higher for establishments than for buildings (9 percent vs. less than 1 percent).</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">Adjustments 
          for unit nonresponse were made by redistributing the baseweights of 
          nonresponding buildings to responding buildings with similar propensities 
          for nonresponse. A predictive model for response propensity was developed 
          to identify subgroups of population with differential response rates. 
          The number of variables available for the modeling was not large but 
          included some that should also be highly predictive of energy use such 
        as climate zone, building size and use, and number of floors.</P>
        <P align=justify class="CategoryTitle">Confidentiality of Information</P>
        <P align=justify class="SubSection">The names or addresses of individual respondents or any other individually identifiable&nbsp;data that could be specifically linked to an individual sample building or building respondent are seen only by&nbsp;employees of EIA,&nbsp;its&nbsp;survey contractor, and EIA-approved agents.&nbsp; The data are kept secure&nbsp;and confidential&nbsp;at all times. The 2003 CBECS is the first&nbsp;survey cycle&nbsp;for which EIA took possession of&nbsp;specific building identifiers.&nbsp; This&nbsp;change, which&nbsp;gives EIA greater capability to handle and manage its data,&nbsp;was the result of a new Federal law, the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA).&nbsp; The&nbsp;legislation gives EIA both the authority and the responsibility&nbsp;to protect&nbsp;from disclosure&nbsp;identifiable data&nbsp;which respondents have been promised would be kept confidential and used&nbsp;exclusively&nbsp;for statistical purposes.&nbsp; The CBECS meets these criteria, and the 2003 cycle was collected under CIPSEA protection. </P>
        <span class="SubSection">
</P>
In order to meet our responsibilities for protecting data for individual respondents,&nbsp;all building identifiers are removed from the data file before the public use microdata file is created. The finest level of geographic detail that is&nbsp;publicly available&nbsp;is the Census division. In addition, building characteristics that could potentially identify a particular responding building, such as number of floors, building square footage, and number of workers in the building, are masked to protect the respondent's identity. </span>
