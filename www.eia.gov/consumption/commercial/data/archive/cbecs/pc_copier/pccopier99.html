 The <a href="../../../../../../emeu/cbecs/cbec-eu3.html"> 
      Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey</a>, or CBECS, collects 
      data on the number of computers and photocopiers in commercial buildings. 
      &nbsp;As the use of computers, as well as the use of other office equipment, 
      has increased over the last ten to fifteen years, the energy consumed by 
      this equipment has risen as well. &nbsp;The Annual Energy Outlook 
      2002 forecasts that commercial energy demand will grow at an average annual 
      rate of 1.7 percent, with the most rapid increases in demand projected for 
      computers, office equipment, and telecommunications and other equipment 
      <a href="http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/index.html" target="_blank"> www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/index.html</a> <b>(opens a new window)</b> -- "Annual Energy Outlook 2002 with Projections to 2020." &nbsp; The 1999 CBECS collected data on the number of computers in commercial buildings, as well as the number of photocopiers excluding 
      small desktop copiers.</p>

 <h3>Computers in 1999 </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There were approximately 58 million computers in commercial buildings 
          in 1999.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Almost two-thirds of all commercial buildings had at least one computer.</li>
        <li>On average, there were 859 computers per million square feet of commercial 
          building space.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>On average, there were 707 computers per thousand employees in commercial 
          buildings, or about 7 computers for every 10 employees.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>

<p align="justify">Figure 1 (below) shows that slightly less than half of all computers were 
      located in office buildings, and about one-fifth were located in education 
      buildings. &nbsp;This distribution of computers has remained essentially 
      unchanged since 1995, when 49 percent of computers were located in office 
      buildings and 19 percent in education buildings. &nbsp;See <a href="table_1.html"> 
      Table 1</a> for detailed data on computers in 1999.</p>

<p>



<p align="justify"> The greatest ratio of computers to square feet was in office buildings, with 2,295 computers per million square feet of space. &nbsp;Large office buildings (greater than 50,000  square feet) had 2,459 computers per million square feet and small office buildings (less than or equal to 50, 000 square feet ) had 2,061 computers per million square feet. &nbsp;Education and health care buildings had the next highest ratio of computers to square feet, with 1,377 computers per million square feet in education buildings and 1,252 computers per million square feet in health care buildings. </p>

<p>

<p align="justify"> The report on computers in commercial buildings in 1995 <a href="../consumptionbriefs/pcsterminals.html"> 
      (PCs and Computer Terminals in Commercial Buildings)</a> speculated that 
      one computer per person might be a natural saturation point in the market 
      for computers. &nbsp;So far, that hypothesis still holds. &nbsp;Only one 
      category, education buildings, has greater than one computer per employee, 
      most likely because students make up a great number of the computer users 
      in education buildings. &nbsp;In office buildings, the ratio in 1999 was 
      about 9.5 computers to 10 employees, continuing the upward trend from approximately 
      8 computers to 10 employees in 1995. </p>

</div>

<p align="Justify">Government-owned buildings  of all types, had, on average, more than one computer per person (1,104  computers per thousand employees). &nbsp;They also had a fairly high ratio  of computers to million square feet (1,257). Nongovernment-owned buildings 
      (all types) had 652 computers per thousand employees and 770 computers per 
      million square feet. &nbsp;A possible explanation for this is that education 
      and office buildings were predominant types of government-owned buildings. 
      &nbsp;Both these activities are very computer-intensive. </p>

      <h3>Photocopiers in 1999</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There were approximately 4.9 million photocopiers in commercial buildings 
          in 1999. &nbsp;</li>
        <li>About 40 percent of all commercial buildings had at least one photocopier. 
          Of those buildings, 24 percent had only one photocopier, while 76 percent 
          had two or more.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>On average, there were 73 photocopiers per million square feet of 
          commercial buildings space.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>On average, there were 60 photocopiers per thousand employees, or 
          about 1 photocopier per 17 employees.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>

<p align="justify">
      Almost half (48 percent) of all photocopiers were located in office buildings. 
      &nbsp;The other half were distributed relatively evenly over the other buildings 
      types.&nbsp; See <a href="table_2.html"> Table 2</a> for detailed data on 
      photocopiers in 1999. </p>

<p align="justify"> The building types with the greatest ratios of photocopiers to square feet were outpatient health care and office buildings, with 204 and 196 photocopiers per million square feet, respectively. &nbsp;Outpatient health care buildings tend to be smaller 
      than other types, but most of them contain at least one photocopier, explaining 
      the high ratio there. </p>

</div>      <p>


<p align="justify"> Buildings whose principal activity was religious worship had the highest ratio of photocopiers to employees, with 95 photocopiers per thousand employees. &nbsp;Office buildings came next, with 91 photocopiers per thousand employees. &nbsp;The religious worship figure may be high because these types of buildings generally have just 
      a few employees but at least one photocopier for business.</p>
      <p align="justify">
      This trend can be seen when considering all types of buildings categorized 
      by number of workers. &nbsp;Buildings with fewer than five workers had the 
      greatest number of photocopiers per thousand employees, and as the number 
      of workers increased the number of photocopiers per employee decreased.<br>

      <h3>Trends: Computers from 1992 to 1995 to 1999</h3>
      <p align="justify"> Since 1992, there has been a steady increase in both the total number of computers in commercial buildings and the ratio of computers to square feet 
      and computers to employees. &nbsp;1992 was the first year the Energy Information 
      Administration began collecting information about computer equipment in 
      CBECS. &nbsp;Growth slowed down for most building types between 1995 and 
      1999, compared to between 1992 and 1995. Office buildings have experienced 
      slower growth rates than other building types, but the number of computers 
      was initially higher in office buildings than in other buildings. &nbsp;<a href="table_3.html"> 
      Table 3</a> and <a href="table_4.html">Table 4</a> compare the number of 
      computers, computers per square foot, and computers per employee in 1992, 
      1995, and 1999.</p>

</div>

<p align="justify"> In Figure 6 , <a href="table_3.html">Table  3</a> , and <a href="table_4.html">Table 4</a> , &nbsp;the category of "assembly" 
      buildings is equivalent to the "public assembly" category used in the 1999 
      tables and figures. &nbsp;The category of "other" buildings includes vacant 
      buildings, religious worship buildings, public order and safety buildings, 
      and laboratories. &nbsp;This category experienced huge growth from 1995 
      to 1999 in computers per thousand employees and computers per million square 
      feet. &nbsp;"Other" buildings had a 462 percent growth rate in computers 
      per thousand employees, and a 364 percent growth rate in computers per million 
      square feet (see Table 4). &nbsp;The 1999 CBECS did not specifically identify 
      buildings or portions of buildings containing large numbers of computers 
      or computer servers. &nbsp;In the 2003 CBECS there will be a separate building 
      activity category for data centers, in addition to specific questions related 
      to space in buildings devoted to computing, so that the characteristics 
      and energy consumption of buildings with a high density of computers can 
      be better understood. &nbsp;</p>
