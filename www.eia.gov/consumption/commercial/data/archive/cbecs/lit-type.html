<p>At a glance, we might conclude that substantial energy savings could occur in both the residential and commercial sectors if they replaced their <A href="profile.html#lit-type1"><STRONG>incandescent lights</STRONG></A> with <A href="profile.html#lit-type2"><STRONG>fluorescent lights</STRONG></A>, given that fluorescent lights
consume approximately 75-85 percent less electricity than incandescent lights.  In the residential sector, this is
true. However, in the commercial sector, where approximately 92 percent of the buildings already use
fluorescent lights, increasing energy savings will require upgrading existing lights and lighting systems.  To
maximize energy savings, analysis must also consider the hours the lights are used and the amount of floorspace
lit by that lighting type.  Figures 1 and 2 show the types of lights used by the percent of households and by the
percent of floorspace lit for the residential and the commercial sectors, respectively.

<P>Nearly all (98 percent) households use incandescent lights, 42
percent use fluorescent lights of any type, and 9 percent use
<A href="profile.html#lit-type3">compact fluorescent lights</A> (Figure 1).  However, when the
actual use of types of lights is considered, only 13 percent of
the lights used for 1 or more hours per day are fluorescent, and
less than 1 percent of lights used for 15 minutes or more per
day are compact fluorescent.

<p>Approximately two-thirds of all commercial buildings use

<p><STRONG><EM>In the Residential Sector</EM> . . .</strong>


<p>The greatest potential for energy savings in the
residential sector occurs for lights that are used for
longer periods of time.  Therefore, potential savings
are calculated for only those lights used for 4 or more
hours per day.  This analysis also assumes that
compact fluorescent lights need about one-third the
wattage of incandescent lights.  Although an 18-watt
compact fluorescent light produces the same number
of lumens as a 75-watt incandescent, issues of light
placement and color quality make a higher wattage
compact fluorescent light more suitable.

<p><CENTER><img src="lit-fig3.gif"  Alt="Figure 3 showing potential energy savings from replacement of incandescent lights with compact flourescent lights in 1993" width="451" height="399" align="bottom" >
</CENTER>
<p>In 1993, U.S. households used a total of 90.8 billion kWh for <A Href="../../../../../emeu/recs/recs4a.html">electricity for lighting</A>.  If households replaced all
incandescent bulbs used four or more hours per day with compact fluorescent lights, they could save 31.7 billion
kWh annually, or 35 percent of all electricity used for residential lighting (Figure 3).

<p><STRONG><EM><strong>In the Commercial Sector</EM> . . .</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 1995, U.S. commercial buildings used a total of 352 billion kWh of <A Href="cbec-eu1.html">electricity for lighting.</A>
Although some energy savings would occur by simply replacing incandescent lights with fluorescent
lights, CBECS data suggest greater energy savings will occur by replacing existing fluorescent lights with <A Href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/erec/factsheets/eelight.html">more
energy-efficient equipment</A>  such as <A Href="http://eande.lbl.gov/R-LabDG/HELP3481.htm"> electronic ballasts</A>, which increase fluorescent efficiency by up to 25 percent.  For example, a study of a 440,000-square-foot office building in Washington, DC, which rewired 
T-12 fluorescent lamps and magnetic ballasts with smaller-diameter T-8 lamps and electronic ballasts, revealed
a potential for annual savings of about 290,000 kWh, worth $27,000 per year to the building owner.  Power per
fixture was reduced by 20 percent, from 110 watts to 88 watts [Harris et al. "Monitored Savings from Energy-Efficient Lighting in DC Office." <i>Center for Building Science News  Spring 1997</i>. Vol.4 No.1].  The 1995
CBECS reported that 48 percent of total commercial floorspace (56 percent of lit floorspace) was served by
fluorescent lights with energy-efficient ballasts.  There remains a significant fraction of commercial building
floorspace that can be upgraded with more energy-efficient lighting equipment.
