</CENTER>



<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 70 detailed tables present extensive cross-tabulations of commercial
buildings characteristics. These data are from the Buildings Characteristics Survey portion of the
1992 CBECS. The  "Quick-Reference Guide," indicates the major topics of each table. 
 Directions for calculating an approximate relative standard error (RSE) for each
estimate in the tables are presented in Figure A1, "Use of RSE Row and Column Factor." The
Glossary contains the definitions of the terms used in the tables. See the preceding "At A
Glance" section for highlights of the detailed tables.</font></p>

  <H2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Table Organization</font></H2>
</CENTER>

<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall Organization</font></H3>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The detailed 
  tables have been grouped together to make it easier to find related information. 
  Table A1 summarizes the total number of buildings, square footage, and workers; 
  the average and median square footage per building and per worker; the average 
  and median operating hours; and the median age of the building. (Note: In the 
  Commercial Buildings Characteristics 1989 report, comparable average statistics 
  were found in Tables 13, 28, 32, and 15, respectively.) Tables A2 through A28 
  contain characteristics related to the geographic location, building structure, 
  and use. Tables A29 through A56 contain data about the energy sources, end uses 
  and equipment found in the buildings. Tables A57 through A67 contain information 
  about conservation measures and Demand-side Management (DSM) programs found 
  in the buildings. Tables A68 through A70 are special tabulations of building 
  characteristics that provide the most comprehensive breakdown of principal building 
  activity and energy sources and end uses, respectively.</font></P>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, there are two tables for each topic, one giving the number of buildings in each
crosstabulation cell, the other giving the floorspace in those buildings. For example, Table A4
for example, provides the number of buildings in the Census regions and divisions while Table
A5 provides the floorspace for these same regions and divisions. For some smaller tables, the
number of buildings and floorspace appear together in a single table.</font></P>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three tables provide percentage statistics: Table A3, "Census Region, Percent of Buildings and
Floorspace," corresponds to the related Table A2, "Number of Buildings and Floorspace." Tables
A30 and A32, "Energy Sources, Percent of Buildings" and "Energy Sources, Percent of
Floorspace," correspond, respectively, to the related Tables A29 and A31, "Number of Buildings
and Floorspace." The percentage tables express each cell total as a percentage of the row
total.</font></P>


<p><br>
<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Floorspace Totals</font></H3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two methods were used to calculate floorspace. In Method 1, the floorspace totals 
include all the floorspace in buildings where the indicated feature was present. 
Therefore, a particular building’s floorspace was either entirely included or 
excluded from a particular table cell. This method was used for the majority of 
the detailed tables.</font></p>


<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a few of the detailed tables, a second method of calculating floorspace was used. In Method 2,
floorspace was calculated as a fraction of the total floorspace. This apportioned floorspace was
determined for each building by multiplying the building’s floorspace by the fraction that had
the indicated feature. For example, Table A44 shows the total floorspace for all buildings
(Method 1) and the total heated floorspace in all buildings (Method 2). The statistics for the total
heated floorspace were determined by multiplying the building’s total floorspace by the
fraction of floorspace that was heated.</font></P>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Floorspace totals using Method 2 are given in one column of Table A24 for the floorspace which
is vacant three or more months. Tables A44, A45, and A46 each have an apportioned total
column, presenting, respectively, the floorspace heated, cooled, or lighted. All statistics in Table
A56 are apportioned totals indicating the total floorspace lighted by each type of lighting
equipment.</font><P>

<p><br>
<H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Analysis Categories</font></H3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following core set of analysis categories appear in the same order in all 
basic tables: floorspace, principal building activity, year constructed, Census 
region, energy sources, and energy end uses. Additional categories are included 
on the tables when they relate to specific overall topic areas. For example, principal 
facility activity would appear on the multibuilding facility Table A25. These 
additional categories are generally grouped into broad topics such as building 
structure, building use, energy sources and end use, equipment and distribution 
systems, and energy management practices, and conservation features. Table A1, 
the summary table, contains the core analysis categories as well as most of the 
additional categories</font>.</P>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are two types of analysis categories, those that divide commercial buildings into exclusive,
nonoverlapping categories and those that indicate nonexclusive, overlapping subsets. For
example, "climate zone" is a set of exclusive categories; a given building belongs in only one of
these. "Energy sources," on the other hand, is a set of nonexclusive categories; a given building
may be included in more than one line under this category since the building may use more than
one energy source. The phrase, "more than one may apply," indicates that the categories under
this row header are overlapping. Both exclusive and overlapping categories may be
nonexhaustive, that is, there may be some buildings that do not fall into any of the listed
categories.</font></P>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tables A2, A29, A31, A33, A60, and A65 in this report are also available on diskette. 
The electronic files on the diskette are flat ASCII files and there is one file 
for each of these tables. The diskette containing the files also contains a READ.ME 
ASCII text file with a table of contents. In addition, CBECS microdata are available 
on Public-Use Diskettes either in ASCII or dBase format (for details on obtaining 
the diskettes, see Appendix B, "How the Survey Was Conducted," Public-Use Diskettes, 
and the inside back cover of this report).</font></P>

  <H2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Row and Column Factors</font></H2>
</CENTER>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tables in this report present estimates for commercial buildings in the United 
States. Since the estimates are based on the sample surveyed, they are subject 
to sampling error. To help the reader compute an approximate RSE for each of the 
estimates presented in the tables, the row and column factors are displayed on 
the top line and in the far-right column of each table, except for the median 
statistics in Table A1, "Summary Table of Average Square Feet, Hours of Operation 
and Age of Building."</font></P>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of the row and column RSE factors is illustrated in Figure A1, using a sample table
from a previous report. Using the row of the table labeled "Mercantile and Service" and the
column labeled "Total Floorspace (million square feet)" gives an estimate of 12.805 billion
square feet for the total commercial floorspace contained in Mercantile and Service buildings.
The RSE row factor is R <sub>Mercantile and Service</sub> = 5.17 . The RSE column factor is
C <sub>Total Floorspace</sub> = 1.096. The approximate RSE for the estimate is, therefore,
computed as</font></P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;RSE <sub>Mercantile and Service, Total
Floorspace</sub><BR><BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= 5.17 × 1.096 = 5.67 percent.<BR><BR>

The approximate standard error for the estimate is,<BR><BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Standard Error <sub>Mercantile and Service, Total
Floorspace</sub><BR><BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;= .0567 × 12,805 = 726 million square feet.<BR><BR></font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This value for the standard error can be used to construct confidence intervals and to perform
hypothesis tests by standard statistical methods. However, because the generalized variance
procedure gives only approximate RSE’s, such confidence intervals and statistical tests must
also be regarded as only approximate. For the example above, the RSE determined directly by
the jackknife method is actually 6.7, not 5.7. For more details about the derivation of the row
and column RSE factors, see Appendix C, "Nonsampling and Sampling Errors."</font></p>
