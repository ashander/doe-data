<p> Lighting represents a substantial fraction of commercial electricity consumption. 
  A wide range of initiatives in the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Energy 
  Strategy have focused on commercial lighting as a potential source of energy 
  conservation. This report provides a statistical profile of commercial lighting, 
  to examine the potential for lighting energy conservation in commercial buildings. 
  The principal conclusion from this analysis is that energy use for lighting 
  could be reduced by as much as a factor of four using currently available technology.
<p>

The analysis is based primarily on the Energy Information Administration's(EIA) 1986
Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). The more recent 1989 survey
had less detail on lighting, for budget reasons. While changes have occurred in the commercial
building stock since 1986, the relationships identified by this analysis are expected to remain
generally valid. In addition, the analytic approach developed here can be applied to the data that
will be collected in the 1992 CBECS.<p>

<center><H3>Lighting Energy Conservation Potential</H3></center><p>

Substantial energy savings are possible using more efficient commercial lighting equipment and
practice. Estimates of the potential savings depend heavily on assumptions regarding the types of
lamps and fixtures to be replaced, the effectiveness of various lighting conservation measures,
and how strong a lighting level is to be maintained. The savings estimates under various
assumptions span a wide range, from under 30 percent to nearly 80 percent of current use
(Figure ES1).<p>

<UL>
<Li><i><b><FONT SIZE=4>Savings from Compact Fluorescent Lamps</FONT></b>:  
Converting all incandescent bulbs (the
typical screw-in type) to compact fluorescent lamps with reflectors is estimated to save close to
30 percent of current (1986) energy use for commercial lighting</i>.<p>

<Li><i><b><FONT SIZE=4>Savings Without Compact Fluorescent Lamps</FONT></b>: 
Even greater savings can be
achieved without using any compact fluorescents, but converting all lamps and fixtures to the
most efficient version of the same type (fluorescent, high-intensity discharge, or incandescent),
together with lighting control devices.</i><p>

<Li><i><b><FONT SIZE=4>Savings from Comprehensive Improvements:</FONT></b>
Universal replacement of lamps and
fixtures by more efficient equivalents, together with lighting controls, could save as much as 72
percent of current commercial lighting energy use. The replacements for this case include the
best of the previous two cases. If, in addition, lighting levels are reduced by 25 percent, the total
savings could reach nearly 80 percent.</i><p>

of savings
estimates obtained, under varying assumptions for the effectiveness of the conservation features
considered for each case.  The potential savings are shown for each case as a percent of the base
case lighting energy estimate (321 billion kilowatthours).  Additional savings are possible if
lighting levels are reduced.<BR>

Nonresidential Buildings Energy Consumption Survey; and sources described in Appendices B
and C.<P>

The savings analysis spans a range of plausible assumptions. Nonetheless, other
modifications to equipment and practice could be considered, and other assumptions for the
effectiveness of these might be more appropriate. This report presents a framework that allows
alternate savings estimates under alternate assumptions.
<p>

These savings estimates are based on the use of current commercially available technologies
and assume that all lights of a given type are replaced immediately. Actual replacements would,
of course, occur over time as the new lighting equipment penetrates the marketplace and
associated costs are reduced as the technology improves. Indeed, in all likelihood some of the
potential savings have already been achieved, through increased penetration of energy-efficient
equipment since the time of the survey the analysis is based on. Thus, the savings estimates are
provided only to describe the potential for savings and are not a prediction of the level of savings
that will be realized in the marketplace.

<H3 align="center">Commercial Lighting Energy Profile</H3><p>

The potential for commercial lighting energy conservation is derived from a statistical profile
developed in this report of commercial lighting energy. This profile reveals important
relationships among lighting energy use and building characteristics including activity, building
size, operating hours, and lighting equipment.<P>

are relatively inefficient.<p>

<h3>Data and Research Needs</h3>

<p>

This study was performed using the 1986 CBECS data, because the more recent 1989 CBECS
had less detail on lighting equipment and conservation features. Extending the methods used
here to other survey years would therefore require further assumptions and approximations.
However, more detailed lighting questions will be restored for the 1992 cycle. The analysis can
be repeated directly with the more up-to-date data when they become available. In addition, the
1992 CBECS sample will be a revisit to the 1986 sample, allowing longitudinal comparisons
over the past six years.<p>

Several extensions to this analysis could be made. One would be to reconcile the energy
estimates with total building electricity consumption. Another would be to incorporate
assumptions about the degradation of equipment efficiency over time. The CBECS data also
contain complete weekly operating schedules; together with the estimates obtained here for
in-use lighting power densities, these schedules could serve as the basis for estimation of lighting
load shapes.<p>

Additionally, the results developed here can be combined with economic equipment assessments
to provide estimates of the costs associated with the conservation strategies. As part of the
Lighting Initiative sponsored by the Office of Conservation and Renewable Energy, economic
analysis of different lighting options is currently being conducted by Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory. Results from this report may be linked to that work.
