<strong><CENTER><H2>WHAT IS FBSS?</H2></CENTER></strong>


<p>The Federal Buildings Supplemental Survey (FBSS) was conducted in 1993 by the Energy
Information Administration (EIA) in conjunction with the Department of Energy's Office of
Federal Energy Management Programs (OFEMP) to gain a better understanding of how Federal
buildings use energy.  OFEMP requested that the FBSS provide building-level energy-related
characteristics for a special sample of commercial buildings owned by the Federal government. 
This special sample met the following OFEMP-specified criteria: <UL>
<LI>(1) Federal buildings from
different areas of the country - Federal Regions 3, 6, and 9; <BR>
<LI> Fewer sample buildings from
Department of Defense (DOD) -- sample selection ratio of 1:10 for DOD buildings in each
Federal Region; and <LI> Commercial building eligibility based on (a) size -- 10,000 square feet or over and (b) building use -- exclude buildings with the majority of the floorspace used for warehouse/storage purposes.
</UL>



<p>Information for Federal commercial buildings is also collected in the Commercial Buildings
Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), which is one of the consumption surveys conducted by
EIA.  CBECS is a national sample survey that collects statistical information on the consumption
of and expenditures for energy in U.S. commercial buildings along with data on energy-related
characteristics of the buildings.  The first CBECS was conducted in 1979 and triennially since
1983.  The number of Federal buildings that are selected for the relatively small CBECS sample
does not allow for in-depth examination of energy use and characteristics of these buildings,
which is necessary to meet the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT).  The FBSS was conducted
to provide more detailed information about Federal buildings.

<P><BR>
<strong><H3>WHAT ARE THE FBSS PUBLIC USE FILES?</H3></strong>


<p>The Public Use Files are microdata files that contain 881 records, which represent specifically
responding Federal commercial buildings from three Federal regions: Federal Region 3
(Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia); Federal
Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas); and Federal Region 9
(Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada).  Each record corresponds to a single responding, in-scope sample building and contains information for that building about the building size, year
constructed, types of energy used, energy-using equipment, conservation features, energy
consumption and expenditures, and temperature data.

<P><BR>
<strong><H3>WHAT IS THE GEOGRAPHIC-LEVEL OF DATA AVAILABLE?</H3></strong>


<p>The FBSS data represents 881 completed telephone interviews with Federal buildings in three
Federal regions.  These buildings were systematically selected using the OFEMP's
specifications; therefore, these data do not statistically represent all Federal buildings in the
United States. The FBSS sample design permits Federal regional-level estimates (weighted
building-level data) for selected building characteristics and consumption and expenditures in the
three Federal Regions listed above.  No national data nor state-level data are available.

<strong><H3>WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF THE PUBLIC USE FILES?</H3></strong>


<p>The Public Use Files are constructed in ASCII and dBase formats.  The records are comma-delimited with fixed column positions.

<P><BR>
<strong><H3>HOW ARE THE PUBLIC USE FILES ORGANIZED?</H3></strong>


<p>The 22 Public Use Data files are organized by subject matter. Each file contains the following
core variables: <OL>
<LI> Building identifier, which is the link between files; <LI>Federal region; 
<LI>Principal building activity;  <LI>Square footage and the square footage category;  <LI>Year constructed category; <LI> Number of workers; <LI> Variance stratum; <LI> Adjusted sampling weight; and
<LI> A set of variables indicating whether electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, district steam or
district hot water was used in the building.
</OL>



<p>Files ending in <strong>T are in ASCII</strong> format and those ending in<strong> D are in dBase</strong> format. <BR><BR>

<p><strong><H3>HOW ARE VARIABLES FROM SEPARATE FILES LINKED?</H3></strong>


<p>In some instances, a FBSS user may want to undertake analysis that requires using a variable
from several different files.  In those cases, the files have to be linked to one another.  The
common variable on each file that can be used to merge files is BLDGID5.



<p><strong><H3>HOW ARE THE VARIABLES THAT BEGIN WITH A Z DIFFERENT FROM THE
VARIABLES THAT DO NOT BEGIN WITH A Z (NON-Z VARIABLES)</H3></strong>


<p>The "Z variables" are also referred to as "imputation flags."  Imputation is a statistical procedure
used to fill in values for missing items.  Many, but not all, of the variables were imputed in the
1993 FBSS.  The imputation flag indicates whether the corresponding non-Z variable was
reported, imputed, missing, or inapplicable.



<p><BR><strong><H3>HOW ARE THE SAMPLE DATA WEIGHTED TO ARRIVE AT A REGIONAL
ESTIMATE?</H3></strong>



<p><BR>The FBSS was designed so that survey responses could be used to estimate characteristics of the
entire Federal commercial stock in each region selected.  To arrive at the regional estimate from
the FBSS sample, base sampling weights for each building, which were the reciprocal of the
probability of that building being selected into the sample, were calculated.  Therefore, a building
with a base weight of 1,000 represents itself and 999 similar, but unsampled buildings in the total
building stock for a region.  The base weight is further adjusted to account for nonresponse bias. 
The variable ADJWT6 in the data file is the adjusted weight.  To obtain a weighted estimate,
each sample building's value must be multiplied by the building's weight.
