     <p><strong></strong><strong>Conventional Electricity Generation:</strong> Thermal generation of electricity by a plant using coal, petroleum,   or natural gas as its source of energy, or hydroelectric generation of   electricity by a plant using natural stream flow as regulated by available   storage. In this report, conventional electricity generation is the direct   nonprocess end use that includes fossil fuel used in electric generators for   which steam is not an intermediate input. If intermediate energy sources are   used, as in cogeneration, the fossil fuel is counted as boiler fuel (i.e., an   indirect use).</p>
     <p><strong>Conversion Factor:</strong> A number that translates units of one system into corresponding   values of another system. Conversion factors are used to translate physical   units of measure for various energy sources into their Btu   equivalents.</p>
     <p><strong>Crude Oil:</strong> A   mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in a liquid state in natural underground   reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through   surface separating facilities. Crude oil is reported as liquid equivalents at   the surface (excluding basic sediment and water), measured in terms of barrels   of 42 U.S. gallons at atmospheric pressure and corrected to 60 degrees   Fahrenheit.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="d" id="d"></a></strong>D</div><br />
     <p><strong>Demand-Side Management (DSM):</strong> A term used to describe a variety of programs sponsored by   utility companies to encourage customers to modify their energy use. In general,   DSM programs are designed to reduce demand or to modify patterns of demand as an   alternative to adding new capacity.</p>
     <p><strong>Direct Nonprocess End Use:</strong> Those end uses that may be found on commercial, residential, or   other sites, as well as at manufacturing establishments. They include heating,   ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), facility lighting, facility support,   onsite transportation, conventional electricity generation, and other nonprocess   uses. &quot;Direct&quot; denotes that only the quantities of electricity or fossil fuel   used in their original state (i.e., not transformed) are included in the   estimates.</p>
     <p><strong>Direct Process End Use:</strong> Those end uses that are specific to the carrying out of   manufacturing. They include process heating, process cooling and refrigeration,   machine drive, electrochemical processes, and other process uses. &quot;Direct&quot;   denotes that only the quantities of electricity or fossil fuel used in their   original state (i.e., not transformed) are included in the estimates. See <strong>Manufacturing Establishment</strong>. </p>
     <p><strong>Distillate Fuel Oil:</strong> The general classification for light fuel oils distilled during the   refining process. The classification includes products known as Nos. 1, 2, and 4   fuel oils and Nos. 1, 2, and 4 diesel fuels. Distillate fuel oil is used   primarily for space heating, on-and-off highway engine fuel, and electric power   generation.</p>
     <p><strong>Durable Goods:</strong> Manufactured goods designed to be durable, such as appliances.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="e" id="e"></a></strong>E</div><br />
     <p><strong>Electricity:</strong> A   form of energy generated by friction, induction, or chemical change that is   caused by the presence and motion of elementary charged particles of which   matter consists.</p>
     <p><strong>Electricity Demand:</strong> Electricity demand is the amount of electricity actually consumed   onsite, regardless of where or how it was produced. It is a useful measure of   electricity consumption without regard to the consumption of other energy   sources. Electricity demand is estimated as the sum of electricity purchases,   transfers in, and total onsite generation minus the quantities of electricity   sold or transferred offsite.</p>
     <p><strong>Electric Utility:</strong> A legal entity engaged in the generation, transmission,   distribution, or sale of electric energy, primarily for use by the public;   legally obligated to provide service to the public within its franchised area;   and required to file forms listed in the<em> Code of Federal Regulations</em>,   Title 18, Part 141. Independent power producers and facilities that qualify as   cogenerators or small power producers under the Public Utility Regulatory   Policies Act are not considered electric utilities. See<strong> Nonutility Power   Producers</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>Electrochemical Process:</strong> The direct process end use in which electricity is used to cause a   chemical transformation. Major uses of electrochemical process occur in the   aluminum industry in which alumina is reduced to molten aluminum metal and   oxygen, and in the alkalies and chlorine industry, in which brine is separated   into caustic soda, chlorine, and hydrogen.</p>
     <p><strong>Embodied Energy for Electricity:</strong> The energy electricity suppliers use to generate the   electricity consumed at the site. See <strong>First Use of Energy for All   Purposes</strong>.</p>
     <p>A use for which total input energy for heat, power, and   electricity generation is consumed at the manufacturing establishment. In   end-use estimates presented in this report, nonfuel uses of energy sources are   not considered. End uses in this report include three broad categories: indirect   uses, direct uses, and direct nonprocess.</p>
     <p><strong>Energy:</strong> The   capacity for doing work as measured in the capability of doing work (potential   energy) or the conversion of this capability to motion (kinetic   energy).</p>
     <p><strong>Energy Intensity</strong>:</strong> The ratio of energy consumption to a measure of the   demand for services (e.g., number of buildings, total floorspace,   floorspace-hours, number of employees, or constant dollar value of Gross   Domestic Product for service</p>
     <p><strong>Energy Source:</strong> A substance, such as natural gas, coal, or electricity, that supplies heat or   power.</p>
     <p><strong>Establishment:</strong> As defined by the <em>Standard Industrial Classification Manual 1987</em>, &quot;. . .   an economic unit, generally at a single physical location, where business is   conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.&quot; See <strong>Manufacturing Establishment</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>Expenditures:</strong> Funds   spent for energy purchased and paid for or delivered to a manufacturer during a   calendar year. For the purposes of the MECS, expenditures include State and   local taxes and delivery charges.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="f" id="f"></a></strong>F</div><br />
     <p><strong>Facility Heating, Ventilation, and Air   Conditioning (HVAC):</strong> The direct nonprocess   end use that includes energy use in systems that condition air in a   building.</p>
     <p><strong>Facility Lighting:</strong> The direct nonprocess end use that includes energy used in equipment   that illuminates buildings and other areas on the establishment site.</p>
     <p><strong>Facility Support:</strong> The direct nonprocess end use that includes energy used in diverse   applications that are normally associated with office or building operations   such as cooking in cafeterias; operation of office equipment such as personal   computers and copying machines; and operation of elevators.</p>
     <p><strong>First Use of Energy for All   Purposes</a>:</strong> All energy consumed by end   users, excluding electricity but including the energy consumed at electric   utilities to generate electricity. This measure includes: </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced offsite and consumed as a fuel </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced offsite and consumed for nonfuel   purposes </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced onsite from nonenergy inputs and   consumed as a fuel </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced onsite from nonenergy inputs and   consumed for nonfuel purposes </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced onsite from energy inputs and   shipped to other establishments. </li>
     </ul>
     <p>They also include estimates of net electricity and   steam consumption; that is, purchases plus transfers in and generation from   noncombustible renewable resources, minus quantities sold and transferred out.   First Use consumption excludes quantities of energy that were produced from   other energy inputs and, therefore, avoids intra-establishment   double-counting.</p>
     <p><strong>Fossil Fuel:</strong> Any naturally occurring organic fuel formed in the Earth&rsquo;s crust, such as coal,   crude oil, and natural gas.</p>
     <p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Any   substance that can be burned to produce heat or power.</p>
     <p><strong>Fuel-Switching Capability:</strong> The short-term capability of a manufacturing establishment to have   used substitute energy sources in place of those actually consumed. Capability   to use substitute energy sources means that the establishment&rsquo;s combustors (for   example, boilers, furnaces, ovens, and blast furnaces) had the machinery or   equipment either in place or available for installation so that substitutions   could actually have been introduced within 30 days without extensive   modifications. Fuel-switching capability does not depend on the relative prices   of energy sources; it depends only on the characteristics of the equipment and   certain legal constraints.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="g" id="g"></a></strong>G</div><br />
     <p><strong>Generation:</strong> The   process of producing steam or electrical energy by transforming other forms of   energy.</p>
     <p><strong>Geothermal Energy (as used at electricity   generating facilities):</strong> Hot water or steam,   extracted from reservoirs in the Earth's crust and supplied to steam turbines   that drive generators to produce electricity.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="h" id="h"></a></strong>H</div><br />
     <p><strong>Hydroelectric Power:</strong> Electricity generated by a turbine driven by falling   water.</p>
     <p><strong>Hydrogen:</strong> A   colorless, odorless, highly flammable gaseous element; the lightest of all   gases.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="i" id="i"></a></strong>I</div><br />
     <p><strong>Indirect Uses (end-use category):</strong> The end-use category that handles boiler fuel. Fuel in   boilers is transformed into another useful energy source, steam or hot water,   which is in turn used in other end uses, such as process or space heating or   electricity generation. Manufacturers find measuring quantities of steam as it   passes through to various end uses especially difficult because variations in   both temperature and pressure affect energy content. Thus, the MECS does not   present end-use estimates of steam or hot water and shows only the amount of the   fuel used in the boiler to produce those secondary energy sources.</p>
     <p><strong>Industrial Sector:</strong> Comprises manufacturing industries that make up the largest part of   the sector along with mining, construction, agriculture, fisheries, and   forestry. Establishments in this sector range from steel mills, to small farms,   to companies assembling electronic components. The SIC codes used to classify   establishments as industrial are 1 through 39.</p>
     <p><strong>Iron and Steel Industry   (</strong><strong>SIC 3312): </strong>Steel Works, Blast Furnaces (Including Coke Ovens),   and Rolling Mills: Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing hot metal,   pig iron, and silvery pig iron from iron ore and iron and steel scrap;   converting pig iron, scrap iron, and scrap steel into steel; and in hot-rolling   iron and steel into basic shapes, such as plates, sheets, strips, rods, bars,   and tubing.</p>

     <p><strong>Local Distribution Company (LDC):</strong> A legal entity engaged primarily in the retail sale and/or   delivery of natural gas through a distribution system that includes mainlines   (that is, pipelines designed to carry large volumes of gas, usually located   under roads or other major right-of-ways) and laterals (that is, pipelines of   smaller diameter that connect the end user to the mainline). Since the   restructuring of the gas industry, the sale of gas and/or delivery arrangements   may be handled by other agents, such as producers, brokers, and marketers that   are referred to as &quot;non-LDC.&quot;</p>
     <div class="glossary_title">M</div><br />
     <p><strong><a name="m" id="m"></a>Machine Drive   (Motors):</strong> The direct process end use in   which thermal or electric energy is converted into mechanical energy. Motors are   found in almost every process in manufacturing. Therefore, when motors are found   in equipment that is wholly contained in another end use (such as process   cooling and refrigeration), the energy is classified there rather than in   machine drive.</p>
     <p><strong>Manufacturing Division:</strong> One of 10 fields of economic activity defined by the <em>Standard   Industrial Classification Manual</em>. The manufacturing division includes all   establishments engaged in the mechanical or chemical transformation of materials   or substances into new products. The other divisions of the U.S. economy are   agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and trapping; mining; construction;   transportation, communications, electric, gas, and sanitary services; wholesale   trade; retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; personal, business,   professional, repair, recreation, and other services; and public administration.   The establishments in the manufacturing division constitute the universe for the   MECS.</p>
     <p><strong>Manufacturing Establishment:</strong> An economic unit at a single physical location where   mechanical or chemical transformations of materials or substances into new   products are performed. Manufacturing operations are generally conducted in   facilities described as plants, factories, or mills, and characteristically use   power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. In addition, the   assembly of components of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, as   in the blending of materials, such as lubricating oils, plastics, resins, or   liquors. See <strong>Establishment</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>Motor Gasoline:</strong> A complex mixture of relatively volatile hydrocarbons, with or without small   quantities of additives, obtained by blending appropriate refinery streams to   form a fuel suitable for use in spark-ignition engines. Motor gasoline includes   both leaded and unleaded grades of finished motor gasoline, blending components,   and gasohol.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="n" id="n"></a></strong>N</div><br />
     <p><strong>Natural   Gas:</strong> A mixture of hydrocarbon compounds   and small quantities of various nonhydrocarbons existing in the gaseous phase or   in solution with crude oil in natural underground reservoirs at reservoir   conditions. Natural gas may be subclassified as: </p>
     <DIR>
     <p>1. Associated Gas: Free natural gas, commonly known   as gas-cap gas, that overlies and is in contact with crude oil in the   reservoir.</p>
     <p>2. Dissolved Gas: Natural gas that is in solution   with crude oil in the reservoir at reservoir conditions.</p>
     <p>3. Nonassociated Gas: Free natural gas that is not in   contact with crude oil in the reservoir.</p>
     </DIR>
     <p>All natural gas volumes are reported in cubic feet at   a pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch at 60 degrees   Fahrenheit.</p>
     <p><strong>Natural Gas Liquids (NGL):</strong> Those portions of reservoir gas that are liquefied at the surface in   field facility or gas processing plants. Some examples are ethane, propane,   butanes, pentanes, natural gasoline, and condensate.</p>
     <p><strong>Natural Gas Utility:</strong> See <strong>Local Distribution Company (LDC)</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>Net   Electricity:</strong> Net electricity is estimated   for each manufacturing establishment as the sum of purchased electricity,   transfers in, and generation from noncombustible renewable resources minus the   quantities of electricity sold and transferred offsite. Thus net electricity   excludes the quantities of electricity generated or cogenerated onsite from   combustible energy sources.</p>
     <p><strong>Nondurable Goods:</strong> Manufactured goods not designed to last, such as food.</p>
     <p><strong>Nonfuel Use (of energy):</strong> Use of energy as feedstock or raw material input.</p>
     <p><strong>Nonprocess Use:</strong> See <strong>Direct Nonprocess End Use.</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Nonutility Power Producer:</strong> A legal entity that owns electric generating capacity and is not an   electric utility. Includes qualifying cogenerators, qualifying small power   producers, and other nonutility generators (including independent power   producers) with a franchised area and not required to file forms listed in the <em>Code of Federal Regulations</em>, Title 18, Part 141. See<strong> Electric   Utility</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>North American Industrial Classification System   (NAICS):</strong> A new classification scheme,   developed by the Office of Management and Budget to replace the Standard   Industrial Classification (SIC) System, that categorizes establishments   according to the types of production processes they primarily use.</p>
    <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="o" id="o"></a></strong>O</div><br /> 
     <p><strong>Offsystem (natural gas):</strong> Natural gas that is transported to the end user by the company   making final delivery of the gas to the end user. The end user purchases the gas   from another company, such as a producer or marketer, not from the delivering   company (typically a local distribution company or a pipeline   company).</p>
     <p><strong>Onsite Transportation:</strong> The direct nonprocess end use that includes energy used in vehicles   and transportation equipment that primarily consume energy within the boundaries   of the establishment. Energy used in vehicles that are found primarily offsite,   such as delivery trucks, is not measured by the MECS.</p>
     <p><strong>Onsystem (natural gas):</strong> Natural gas that is sold (and transported) to the end user by the   company making final delivery of the gas to the end user. Companies that make   final delivery of natural gas are typically local distribution companies or   pipeline companies.</p>
 <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="p" id="p"></a></strong>P</div><br />    
     <p><strong>Petrochemical Feedstock:</strong> Chemical feedstocks derived from petroleum and used principally for   the manufacture of chemicals, synthetic rubber, and a variety of   plastics.</p>
     <p><strong>Petroleum   Coke:</strong> A solid residue, high in carbon   content and low in hydrogen, which is the final product of thermal decomposition   in the condensation process in cracking crude oil. Petroleum coke can yield   almost pure carbon or artificial graphite suitable for the production of carbon   or graphite electrodes, structural graphite, motor brushes, dry cells, and   similar products.</p>
     <p><strong>Plant:</strong> Commonly   used as a synonym for an establishment. However, the term can also be used to   refer to a particular process within an establishment.</p>
     <p><strong>Process Cooling and Refrigeration:</strong> The direct process end use in which energy is used to lower   the temperature of substances involved in the manufacturing process. Examples   include freezing processed meats for later sale in the food industry and   lowering the temperature of chemical feedstocks below ambient temperature for   use in reactions in the chemical industries. Not included are uses such as   air-conditioning for personal comfort and cafeteria refrigeration. See<strong> Manufacturing Establishment</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>Process   Heating:</strong> The direct process end use in   which energy is used to raise the temperature of substances involved in the   manufacturing process. Examples are many and include the use of heat to melt   scrap for electric-arc furnaces in steel-making, to separate components of crude   oil in petroleum refining, to dry paint in automobile manufacturing, and to cook   packaged foods. Not included are heat used for heating of buildings or for   cafeteria and personal cooking. See<strong> Manufacturing   Establishment</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>Process Use: </strong>See<strong> Direct Process End Use.</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Propane   (C3H8):</strong> A normally   gaseous, straight-chain, paraffinic hydrocarbon extracted from natural gas or   refinery gas streams. In the manufacturing sector, it is used as a petrochemical   feedstock.</p>
     <p><strong>Propylene   (C3H6):</strong> A normally   gaseous olefinic hydrocarbon recovered from refinery processes or petrochemical   processes. In the manufacturing sector, propylene is used primarily as a   petrochemical feedstock.</p>
     <p><strong>Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978   (PURPA):</strong> One part of the National Energy Act   of 1978, this legislation contains measures designed to encourage the   conservation of energy, more efficient use of resources, and equitable rates.   Principal among those measures were suggested retail rate reforms and new   incentives for production of electricity by cogenerators and users of renewable   resources. The authority for implementing several key PURPA programs is held by   an independent regulatory agency within the U.S. Department of   Energy.</p>
     <p><strong>Pulping Liquor (Black Liquor):</strong> The alkaline spent liquor removed from the digesters in the   process of chemically pulping wood. After evaporation, the liquor is burned as a   fuel in a recovery furnace that permits the recovery of certain basic   chemicals.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="q" id="q"></a></strong>Q</div><br />
     <p><strong>Quadrillion Btu:</strong> Equivalent to 1015 Btu.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="r" id="r"></a></strong>R</div><br />
     <p><strong>Real   Dollars:</strong> Real dollars are currency in   terms of the goods and services the currency can buy. In essence, real dollars   are dollars that have been adjusted for inflation. In this report, 1991 and 1994   dollars were first converted to real 1992 dollars by dividing, or &quot;deflating,&quot;   the nominal dollars by the chain-type price indices for gross domestic product   for 1991 and 1994, respectively. Then, because real 1994 dollars were used, the   real 1992 dollars were divided by the 1994 price index.</p>
     <p><strong>Refinery:</strong> A   plant, device, or process that heats crude oil so that it separates into   chemical components, which are then distilled off as more usable   substances.</p>
     <p><strong>Relative Standard Error (RSE):</strong> A percentage measure of the precision of a survey statistic.   The RSE is defined as the standard error of a survey estimate divided by the   survey estimate and multiplied by 100. The standard error is the square root of   the variance.</p>
     <p><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Energy obtained from essentially inexhaustible sources, which are   not necessarily combustible. Combustible sources of renewable energy include   wood harvested directly from trees, tree bark, and wood waste. Noncombustible   sources include solar power, wind power, hydropower, and geothermal   power.</p>
     <p><strong>Residual Fuel   Oil:</strong> The general classification for the   heavier oils that remain after the distillate fuel oils and lighter hydrocarbons   are distilled away in refinery operations. The classification includes No. 5   (light and heavy), No. 6 (including heavy-grade, so called Bunker C oil), and   Navy Special fuel oil.</p>
     <p><strong>Roundwood:</strong> Wood   cut specifically for use as a fuel.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="s" id="s"></a></strong>S</div><br />
     <p><strong>Short Ton:</strong> A   unit of weight equal to 2,000 pounds.</p>
     <p><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> The radiant energy of the sun, which can be converted into other forms of   energy, such as heat or electricity.</p>
     <p><strong>Spot Market (natural gas):</strong> A market in which natural gas is bought and sold for immediate or   very near-term delivery, usually for a period of 30 days or less. The   transaction does not imply a continuing arrangement between the buyer and the   seller. A spot market is more likely to develop at a location with numerous   pipeline interconnections, thus allowing for a large number of buyers and   sellers. The Henry Hub in southern Louisiana is the best known spot market for   natural gas.</p>
     <p><strong>Standard Industrial   Classification (SIC):</strong> A classification   scheme, developed by the Office of Management and Budget, that categorizes   establishments according to the types of goods they primarily   produce.</p>
     <p><strong>Still Gas (refinery gas):</strong> Any form or mixture of gases produced in refineries by distillation,   cracking, reforming, and other processes, the principal constituents of which   are hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butanes, butylene,   etc. Still gas is used as a petrochemical feedstock and as a fuel in   refineries.</p>
     <p><strong>Storage Capacity:</strong> Includes, for the purposes of the MECS, any volumetric capacity   (including tank tops and tank bottoms) that is on the establishment site even if   it is dedicated or leased for the storage of an energy source by other   establishments.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="t" id="t"></a></strong>T</div><br />
     <p><strong>Total   Inputs of Energy for Heat, Power, and Electricity   Generation:</strong> Use of energy in the   production of heat, steam, power, or the generation of electricity. This measure   includes: </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced offsite and consumed as a fuel </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced onsite from nonenergy inputs and   consumed as a fuel </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
       <li>Energy produced onsite from energy inputs and   consumed as a fuel. </li>
     </ul>
     <p>The estimates of combustible energy for these tables   represent total consumption as a fuel, regardless of where the energy was   produced. </p>
     <p>The consumption estimates for fuel use are not   duplicative. There is clearly no duplication for quantities that were produced   offsite as well as for those produced onsite from nonenergy sources. Quantities   produced onsite from other energy inputs result from consumption of an energy   source as a feedstock or raw material input. They do not result from the   consumption of an energy as a fuel.</p>
     <p>Examples of energy produced onsite from other energy   sources include </p>
     <p>Coke oven gas produced as a byproduct of the   destructive distillation of coal to produce coke </p>
     <p>Petroleum coke produced in refineries as a result of   the high temperature treatment of petroleum fractions </p>
     <p>Still gas produced in refineries as a result of   distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. </p>
     <p>From these examples, it is clear that the input   energy was not consumed as a fuel and would not have been included elsewhere. </p>
     <p>The estimates of electricity and steam (note that   steam is included in the &quot;other&quot; energy category) must conform to the same   criteria as combustible energy. That is, they must represent</p>
     <p>inputs to produce heat and power and to generate   electricity that do not duplicate energy content represented elsewhere in the   table. </p>
     <p>In the case of electricity, the quantities generated   onsite by conventional generation or cogeneration must be excluded because the   input fuels to produce the electricity (coal, forexample) are already counted   elsewhere. Thus, the nonduplicative measure of electricity input for these   tables is the same net electricity estimate that appeared in </p>
     <p>First Use of Energy for All Purposes. The same   rationale applies to steam. Onsite production is excluded because the input fuel   would be counted elsewhere. Thus, the allocation of energy to the various   sources shown in the Total Inputs measure is consistent with a concept of First   Use of Energy for Heat, Power, and Electricity Generation.</p>
     <p><strong>Turbine:</strong> A   machine for generating rotary mechanical power from the energy of a stream of   fluid (such as water, steam, or hot gas). Turbines convert kinetic energy to   mechanical energy through the principles of impulse and reaction or a mixture of   the two.</p>
     <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="v" id="v"></a></strong>V</div><br />
     <p><strong>Value of   Production:</strong>Calculated as the value of shipments plus inventory   change during the year (subtract prior year-end from current year-end   inventories) in constant 1992 dollars.<br />
         <br />
       <strong>Value of   Shipments</strong>: Received or receivable net selling values (exclusive of   freight and taxes) of all primary and secondary products shipped, as well as all   miscellaneous receipts for contract work performed for others, installation and   repair, sales of scrap, and sales of products bought and resold without further   processing. Deflated to constant 1992 dollars.</p>
       <div class="glossary_title"><strong><a name="w" id="w"></a></strong>W</div><br />
     <p><strong>Waste Materials:</strong> Otherwise discarded   combustible materials that, when burned, produce energy for such purposes as   space heating and electric power generation. The size of the waste may be   reduced by shredders, grinders, or hammermills. Noncombustible materials, if   any, may be removed. The waste may be dried and then burned, either alone or in   combination with fossil fuels.</p>
     <p><strong>Waste Oils and Tar:</strong> Petroleum-based materials that are worthless for any purpose other   than fuel use.</p>
     <p><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Energy present in wind motion that can be converted to mechanical energy for   driving pumps, mills, and electric power generators. Wind pushes against sails,   vanes, or blades radiating from a central rotating shaft.</p>
     <p><strong>Wood Energy:</strong> Wood and wood products used as fuel, including round wood (cord wood), limb   wood, wood chips, bark, sawdust, forest residues, charcoal, pulp waste, and   spent pulping liquor.</p>
