</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The Energy Information Administration (EIA) designed the 1994
Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) to provide information on the consumption
of energy by the manufacturing division, as defined by the Standard Industrial
Classification system (SIC) published by US Office of Mangement and Budget.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The MECS began as a triennial survey, with data collected for
calendar years 1985, 1988, 1991, and 1994. Federal energy legislation passed in 1992
revised the MECS collection schedule. Beginning in 1994, EIA will conduct the MECS every
four years, rather than every three years. &nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">This report about changes in energy intensity is the third report
based on the 1994 MECS. Other publications include reports detailing the development of
the 1994 survey<a href="appd_1.html#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the 1994 consumption of energy.<a
href="appd_1.html#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">This report includes estimates on changes in energy intensity
among MECS survey years -- 1985, 1988, 1991, and 1994.&nbsp; Estimates of energy
consumption in 1985, 1988, 1991, and 1994 are calculated using data from the MECS. The
Bureau of the Census provided economic data (e.g., value of shipments, value added)
collected by the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM).&nbsp; The Bureau of Economic
Analysis provided chain-weighted, industry-specific price indices.&nbsp; These indices
were applied to current dollar value of shipments to obtain value of shipments in 1992
constant dollars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The basic unit of data collection for the MECS is the
manufacturing establishment. A nationally representative sample of these establishments is
selected to receive the questionnaire. The EIA provides survey specifications to the
Census Bureau, which selects the MECS sample from the list of establishments responding to
the ASM, conducts the fieldwork, and handles data processing. The Census Bureau performs
these functions to ensure complete confidentiality of individual responses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">This appendix presents a brief overview of the survey, sample
design, and estimation procedures for the 1994 MECS.&nbsp; In addition to this appendix, a
methodological report published in 1992 presents a nonstatistical description of sample
selection issues for the 1991 survey. And a methodological report published for the 1985
survey presents details relating to the background of the maiden survey, original forms
design, sample design, and estimation procedures. This appendix presents a brief overview
of the survey, sample design, and estimation procedures.&nbsp; For a detailed review of
the sampling methodologies used for each MECS, please reference the appropriate
consumption report.&nbsp; For example, the EIA report <em>Manufacturing Consumption of
Energy 1994</em>, DOE/EIA-0512(94) serves as the sampling reference for the 1994 MECS.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><strong>The Estimation Process</strong> <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The MECS sample represents the portion of manufactures in the
manufacturing universe covered by the ASM mail sample. This portion, when sampled
establishments are weighted up, accounts for approximately 98 percent of total
manufacturing value of shipments and receipts. Weighing up inflates reported values from
the sample to that portion of the population it represents. Multiplying a reported or
derived value by an establishment-specific sample weight inflates the reported values to
population values. Each establishment included in the MECS sample has an associated
sampling weight with two components: sample weight and adjustment factor for nonresponse.
The first component is the reciprocal of the establishment's overall probability of
selection into the ASM and subsequent selection for the MECS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The second component of the sampling weight addresses
questionnaire nonresponse by establishments sent a MECS form but, for whatever reasons,
did not respond. An establishment is selected into the MECS sample with a probability
proportional to its energy measure of size. In effect, the estimated contribution each
establishment makes to total manufacturing energy consumption is its measure of size.
Adjustment factors for nonresponse are calculated using the known energy measures of size
of the respondents and the entire sample. ASM or Census of Manufactures (CM) data provide
this information. Each of the sampling strata has a separate adjustment factor: <br

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana">where <em>MOS<sub>s,j</sub></em> is the measure of size for MECS
sample establishment <em>j</em> in stratum <em>s</em>. In this formula, <em>MOS<sub> s,i</sub>
</em>is the measure of size for MECS respondent <em>I</em> in stratum <em>s</em>. The MOS
is determined using ASM reported cost of fuels and electrical energy. <br wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">This nonresponse adjustment is important for interpreting
aggregate statistics such as consumption and fuel-switching capability; however, it does
not affect energy intensity measures, as shown in the next section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>Technical Approach</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Previous MECS energy-intensity reports identified the change in energy intensity resulting
from more or less Offsite-Produced Energy. This report also presents the changes in energy
intensity caused by either increased or decreased use of energy sources produced at
manufacturing establishments. In addition, this report includes changes in intensity that
result from the changes in relative output by industries (i.e., structural shifts). As in
previous reports, output is defined as the constant dollar value of shipments and
receipts. These were expressed in terms of constant 1982 or 1987 dollars for the previous
reports. This report uses constant 1992 dollars. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Comparing ratios of the amount of energy consumed per a common
unit of output over a specified period identifies trends. The MECS reports trends for the
2-digit SIC codes in question and the entire manufacturing sector. These demand ratios,
traditionally termed energy intensities, take the general form of: </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><img src="img4.gif"  alt="Equation 2" width="601" height="50" align="left"></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana">where <em>E</em> denotes energy consumption, and <em>Q</em>
represents output. Subsets of the manufacturing sector (e.g., 2-digit SIC categories) and
the entire manufacturing sector had separate measures of energy intensity calculated. This
was done because each subset had a common unit for consumption and output.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">With energy intensities available for two periods, the raw change
in the demand for energy between base year, <em>b</em>, and the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em>
subsequent year, <em>b+n</em> can be expressed as: </font></p>

intensities, D <em>I<sub>b:b+n</sub></em> is generally presented with respect to the base
year's energy intensity. This is written as: </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Evaluation of the Effects on Energy Demand</strong>
<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The manufacturing sector continually evolves. Evidence of this is
the growth of some industries while other industries become less important. Examples
include the decline of wagon makers when automobiles became available. A more current
example is the growth of the compact disc industry with the subsequent decline of the LP
record and eight-track tape industries. This evolution requires that any analytical
approach for measuring changes in energy demand take two factors into account: The
approach must <strong>cleanly</strong> attribute the effect on energy demand associated
with <em>structural shifts</em>, as well as the effect of <em>real efficiency changes</em>.
This approach produces both an estimated value of real efficiency improvements as well as
an estimate of variations in manufacturing composition (structural shifts). Currently,
there are two predominant approaches used to disentangle aggregate changes in energy
demand: the Divisia<sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_3_">(3)</a></sup> and the Laspeyres<sup><a
href="appd_1.html#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> indices approaches. Several energy analysts--Jenna <em>et al</em>,<sup><a
href="appd_1.html#N_5_">(5)</a></sup> Marlay,<sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> EIA,<sup><a
href="appd_1.html#N_7_">(7)</a></sup> and most recently, Howarth <em>et al</em><sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_8_">(8)</a></sup>--have
used the Divisia approach to separate real energy efficiencies from structural shifts.
However, for this report, EIA applied the Laspeyres technique, favoring the Laspeyres'
ease of interpretation. This approach cleanly decomposes the aggregate change in energy
intensity into three effects: structural shifts, real efficiency changes, and an
interaction of structural shifts and real efficiency changes. In contrast, the Divisia
approach identifies only main effects.<sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_9_">(9)</a></sup> In addition, EIA
and Howarth <em>et al</em><sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_10_">(10)</a></sup> have shown that Laspeyres
and Divisia derived estimates of the decomposed effects are remarkably similar. EIA has
also derived a measure of reliability for decomposed effects under the Laspeyres approach.<sup><a
href="appd_1.html#N_11_">(11)</a></sup> </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">This report uses the Laspeyres approach to decompose the aggregate
change in energy intensities. The decomposition results in <em>real efficiency changes</em>,
<em>structural shifts</em>, and the interaction of <em>real efficiency changes</em> and <em>structural
shifts</em>. To accomplish this, rewrite the energy intensity ratio given in Equation (3)
as: </font></p>

wp="br1">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The MECS consumption of energy reports include, among others,
tables identifying four different measures of energy consumption. These include: <br
wp="br2">
</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Total Primary Consumption of Energy for all purposes</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Total Primary Consumption of Energy for nonfuel (feedstock)
    purposes</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Total Inputs of Energy for heat, power, and electricity</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Total Consumption of Offsite-Produced Energy for heat, power, and
    electricity. <br wp="br1">
    </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">This report identifies two measures of energy intensity by
selected SIC codes. The first measure is Offsite-Produced Energy for heat, power, and
electricity per constant 1992 dollar of products shipped. The second measure of intensity
is Total Inputs of Energy for heat, power, and electricity per constant 1992 dollar of
products shipped. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
For each SIC, the difference between the quantities reported as<em> Total Inputs</em> of
Energy for heat, power, and electricity and the quantities reported as <em>Offsite-Produced</em>
Energy consumed for those same purposes indicates the amount of energy produced and then
consumed onsite. Comparing changes in energy intensity based on these two measures
indicates the effect of Onsite-Produced Energy sources on intensity changes. Any
difference between intensities based on the two measures would imply the increased
(decreased) use of Onsite-Produced Energy. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>Energy efficiency cannot be inferred directly from changes in energy-intensity
ratios.</strong> While improved energy efficiency does indicate reduced energy intensity,
it is also true that a change in energy intensity can result from factors unrelated to
energy efficiency. Energy produced onsite and structural shifts in production mix are two
of those factors. <br wp="br1">

    publishing constraints.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">One basic adjustment has been excluded from shipment data:&nbsp;
    changes in manufacturing inventory.&nbsp; Because value of shipments estimates do not
    account for changes in inventory, dramatic fluctuations in beginning and ending

    to address this issue in an upcoming <a href="mailto:radler@eia.doe.gov">report</a>.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><font face="Verdana">In order to calculate an industry's change in energy intensity, it
is necessary to have some common measure of output to compare with energy consumption.
Since the outputs of manufacturing establishments are physical units, these might appear
to be the most appropriate measure. However, one major problem with using a physical
measure of output is that it cannot be standardized within an industry or across
industries. A single manufacturing establishment or industry may produce a wide variety of
end products. These products would have to be aggregated to calculate the change in
intensity. In SIC 22 (Textiles), for example, adding the quantity of cheesecloth produced
in SIC 2211 to the quantity of fabric produced in SIC 2221 would not yield any meaningful
measure of output. This difficulty with using a physical measure of output encourages the
use of an economic measure as a proxy. The Census Bureau collects data on the value of
shipments and receipts of manufacturers as well as the value added by manufactures.
Because the MECS sample is drawn from the list of establishments covered by the CM and
ASM, these economic data are available for establishments that respond to the MECS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">If the goal were to calculate the total output of the entire
manufacturing sector, value added would be the appropriate economic measure to use. This
measure represents the unique contribution of a manufacturer to the production of a
finished good. Calculation of value added requires subtracting the cost of all materials
from the value of shipments. This is then added to the net change in finished goods and
work in progress inventory. Basically, value added consists of wages and employee
supplements, net interest, indirect business taxes and adjustments, and income or
corporate profits.<sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_12_">(12)</a></sup> </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Value of shipments and receipts consists of the total receipts for
products manufactured, services rendered, and the resales of products bought and sold
without further manufacture. It is the dollar value received by the manufacture for the
products it sells. For any industry group, this measure contains a large amount of
duplication since the product outputs of one industry may be used as raw material inputs
by others. For example, a manufacturer of copper wire may sell that wire to another
manufacturer that builds electric motors. The electric motor manufacturer may, in turn,
sell electric motors to a manufacturer that assembles refrigerators. Thus, the cost of the
copper wire, which originated with the first manufacturer, appears in the value of
shipments for all three. Summing the values of shipments for these three manufacturers
would contain duplication of the cost of the copper wire. Because of this duplication,
total manufacturing sector output is not the summation of individual industry groups'
value of shipments. For the same reason, it is not accurate to compare changes in
intensity across SIC codes but only between a single SIC grouping or the entire
manufacturing sector.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The duplication inherent in the value of shipments measure is <strong>not</strong>
an important consideration when calculating changes in intensity. The purpose is not to
compare the efficiency ratios between industries, but rather, to compare energy
consumption per unit of output at different points in time for each industry group. In
most cases, whatever duplication existed in the base year will also be present in the
comparison years. Value added as a percent of the value of shipments in this case is
approximately equal for the base and comparison years. If industry groups have perfectly
stable proportions of value added to value of shipments, the same estimate of energy
intensity change will result regardless of whether the base is the value of shipments or
value added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">If value added as a proportion of value of shipments differs
between the base and comparison years, constant dollar value of shipments more closely
approximates physical production than does constant dollar value added, according to
previous studies.<sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_13_">(13)</a></sup> For this reason, the proxy measure
of output for calculating energy intensity ratios included in this report is constant
dollar value of shipments. This surrogate for physical output is fully consistent with the
procedures adopted by other Federal agencies for estimating output. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) publishes a productivity measure known as &quot;output per employee
hour.&quot; Dividing an output index by an index of aggregate employee hours for a given
industry produces this index. According to the BLS, </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;...industry output indexes are based on quantifiable units
  of products or services of the industry.... Whenever possible, physical quantities are
  used as the unit of measurement. For those industries lacking quantity data,
  constant-dollar value of shipments, sales, or revenue data are used to develop the output
  series.&quot;<sup><a href="appd_1.html#N_14_">(14)</a></sup> </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana">This report investigates structural shifts as one reason energy
intensity may have changed between the years in question. Calculation of these shifts was
done at the lowest possible level (four-digit, then three-digit, then two-digit SIC). The
sample size for the 1985 and 1988 MECS surveys was relatively small.&nbsp; Because of
this, it was not possible to provide energy consumption estimates for any but the 10
largest four-digit industries. In addition, the samples were too small to produce accurate
estimates of energy consumption for all of the three-digit industries. Letting both
structural and intensity vary does not lend any additional significant interpretations.

Sampling error is the variability in a survey estimator that occurs because data are
collected from a sample of units rather than from the entire population. A different
estimate of population parameters is possible from each potential sample. Nonsampling
errors are those associated with all aspects of the total survey design other than the
sampling process. Nonsampling errors can include both random and systematic (biasing)
errors. Commonly recognized sources of nonsampling error include undercoverage, random and
systematic response errors, nonresponse, data processing errors, and tabulation errors.

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Gathering data from samples of the population
(survey) rather than the entire population (census) results in estimates that differ from
true population estimates. The MECS is a survey, and as such, provides only one of a
possible number of estimates. Estimates from other samples would differ depending on which
establishments are in each sample.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">One measure of the variability in estimates due to
sampling is the average squared differences between the estimates by all possible samples
and the mean value of those estimates. This type of measure is known as sampling error,
and identifies the magnitude of sampling error. A single sample provides data to obtain
the standard error of an estimate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">RSE Tables 1-2 of this appendix present standard errors computed
for the estimated energy efficiency changes. Using pre-existing data, the estimates are
calculated as relative standard errors (RSE's), and converted to standard errors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The relative variances and covariences of energy consumption are
the primary information required for the development of RSE's. The constant dollar value
of shipments and estimated change in energy intensity are additional information used in
the calculations. To calculate RSE's, the standard error is multiplied by 100, then
divided by the estimate to which it refers. Approximate RSE's are computed using a
specially-derived formula. The following paragraphs describe the derivation of the
formula.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Ignoring the multiplier of 100, the change in energy efficiency
for an industry group given in Equation (4) of Appendix A is: </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The four MECS collections provide the components of these
rel-variances, as well as information provided by the Census Bureau. Estimates of the
rel-variances are substituted into Equation (21) to derive the RSE's of the estimated
changes in energy intensity. Standard errors for Tables 1-12 are calculated by dividing
these RSE's by 100 and multiplying by the corresponding estimate of intensity change.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Nonsampling Errors and Bias</strong></font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Nonsampling errors are not associated with obtaining data through
a sample rather than a complete census. These errors can occur in any data gathering
activity and fall into four general categories: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><em>Operational Errors </em>include errors that result from
    inaccurate editing, coding and/or tabulating data. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><em>Errors of Measurement</em> or respondent errors result from
    problems such as misunderstanding instructions or lack of precision in providing data.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><em>Estimation Errors</em> are caused by inaccurate or incomplete
    assumptions underlying the values of the survey estimator.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><em>Errors of Nonobservation</em> result from nonresponse or
    incomplete coverage.</font></li>
</ul>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Minimizing Errors</strong></font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">MECS uses several methods to ensure accurate
estimates. These include: </font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Data collection by the Census Bureau that minimizes the likelihood
    of operational errors. The quality control procedures carried out at each step of data
    check-in, editing, coding, and keying are standard Census Bureau procedures. These are the
    same procedures used for the ASM and the CM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Verification of data tabulations including comparing marginal
    totals in tables generated from files supplied to EIA with corresponding totals generated
    directly from microdata files held at the Census Bureau.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Computer edits to identify measurement errors. These edits check
    both internal consistency as well as data consistency between MECS responses and ASM
    responses for the same establishment. An industry specialist reviews any response that
    fails an edit. This specialist is familiar with the manufacturing processes used by, and
    associated energy consumption of, the SIC in question. When necessary, the specialist
    contacts the individual(s) responsible for completing the questionnaire to verify
    questionable responses or provide data for any nonresponse items. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">No editing procedure can identify all measurement errors, and it
is reasonable to assume some small errors are not corrected. To the extent these errors
are due to random rather than systematic misreporting, they are compensating in the
aggregate totals calculated. Very few large systematic biases for the MECS result from
unidentified measurement errors. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Estimation errors can result from any of the assumptions used to estimate the consumption
of Offsite-Produced Energy or Total Inputs of Energy consumed for heat, power, or
electricity generation. These are the two measures of consumption used in calculating the
changes in energy intensity included in this report. Both Offsite-Produced Energy and
Total Inputs of Energy are derived measures of consumption rather than reported values.
They are both based on two primary assumptions: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">An establishment consumes all energy produced onsite.&nbsp;
    Offsite-Produced Energy is consumed onsite only if there is insufficient onsite production
    to meet the establishment's need for that particular energy source. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">The second assumption is that consumption of onsite-produced energy
    sources will meet raw material or feedstock requirements first, with any remaining
    quantities consumed as a fuel.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;It is believed these assumptions accurately reflect the
energy-use patterns of the most manufacturing establishments. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Consumption estimates will be biased if the above assumptions are
incorrect. For example, one assumption is that energy produced onsite meets feedstock
requirements before fuel requirements. This could result in consistently underestimating
the consumption of offsite-produced feedstocks and overestimating the consumption of
offsite-produced fuels. If this were the case, an overestimation of the energy intensity
ratios is the result. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
If derived values are calculated using a consistent methodology from one survey cycle to
the next, any bias due to estimation errors will be present to approximately the same
degree in both cycles. Because the primary focus of this report is the change in energy
intensity ratios from one period to another, persistent bias would eliminate itself. As
such, it is believed that bias in the changes in energy intensity due to estimation errors
is minimal. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
Appendix A describes the MECS survey and explains that portion of the manufacturing sector
it represents (i.e., the mail portion of the ASM, with the exception of the 1988 MECS).
For this report, adjusted consumption values represent those three-digit industry groups,
or combinations of three-digit industry groups, judged sufficiently accurate for the
purposes of this analysis. Noncoverage errors could result from the procedures used to
define these groups. Adjustments are made to account for nonresponses. These involve a
ratio adjustment of the weighted data for respondents. Small establishments tend to have
the highest nonresponse rate to the MECS. Because of this, the adjustment primarily
affects the contribution of relatively small establishments. Without this adjustment, the
MECS estimators produced from only the responding establishments would not have
represented the target universe. Unadjusted estimators would also result in biased survey
estimates. <br wp="br1">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Solar Energy:</b> The radiant energy of the sun,
which can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or electricity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Spot Market (Natural Gas):</b> A market in which
natural gas is bought and sold for immediate or very near-term delivery, usually for a
period of 30 days or less. The transaction does not imply a continuing arrangement between
the buyer and the seller. A spot market is more likely to develop at a location with
numerous pipeline interconnections, thus allowing for a large number of buyers and
sellers. The Henry Hub in southern Louisiana is the best known spot market for natural
gas.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Standard Industrial Classification (SIC):</b> A
classification scheme, developed by the Office of Management and Budget, that categorizes
establishments according to the types of goods they primarily produce.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Still Gas (Refinery Gas):</b> Any form or mixture
of gases produced in refineries by distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes,
the principal constituents of which are hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane,
propylene, butanes, butylene, etc. Still gas is used as a petrochemical feedstock and as a
fuel in refineries.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Storage Capacity:</b> Includes, for the purposes
of the MECS, any volumetric capacity (including tank tops and tank bottoms) that is on the
establishment site even if it is dedicated or leased for the storage of an energy source
by other establishments.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Subbituminous Coal:</b> A dull, black coal of
intermediate rank between lignite and bituminous coal. Subbituminous coal, like bituminous
coal, is used as a fuel.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Total Inputs of Energy for Heat, Power, and
Electricity Generation:</b> Use of energy in the production of heat, steam, power, or the
generation of electricity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Turbine:</b> A machine for generating rotary
mechanical power from the energy of a stream of fluid (such as water, steam, or hot gas).
Turbines convert kinetic energy to mechanical energy through the principles of impulse and
reaction or a mixture of the two.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Value Added by Manufacture:</b> This measure of
manufacturing activity is derived by subtracting the cost of materials, supplies,
containers, fuel, purchased electricity, and contract work from value of shipments. The
result of this calculation is adjusted by the addition of value added by merchandising
operations (i.e., the difference between the sales value and the cost of merchandise sold
without further manufacture, processing, or assembly) plus the net change in finished
goods and work-in-process between the beginning- and end-of-year inventories. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
&quot;Value Added&quot; avoids the duplication in the figure for value of shipments that
results from the use of products of some establishments as materials by others. Value
added is considered to be the best value measure available for comparing the relative
economic importance of manufacturing among industries. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Value of Shipments:</b> This item covers the
received or receivable net selling values, f.o.b. plant (exclusive of freight and taxes),
of all products shipped as well as all miscellaneous receipts, such as receipts for
contract work performed for others, installation and repair, sales of scrap, and sales of
products bought and resold without further processing. Included are all items made by or
for the establishments from materials owned by it, whether sold, transferred to other
plants of the same company, or shipped on consignment. The net selling value of products
made in one plant on a contractual basis from materials owned by another was reported by
the plant providing the materials. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
In the case of multiunit companies, the manufacturer was requested to report the value of
products transferred to other establishments of the same company at full economic or
commercial value, including not only the direct cost of production but also a reasonable
proportion of &quot;all other costs&quot; (including company overhead) and profit. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Waste Materials:</b> Otherwise discarded
combustible materials that, when burned, produce energy for such purposes as space heating
and electric power generation. The size of the waste may be reduced by shredders,
grinders, or hammermills. Noncombustible materials, if any, may be removed. The waste may
be dried and then burned, either alone or in combination with fossil fuels.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Waste Oils and Tar:</b> Petroleum-based materials
that are worthless for any purpose other than fuel use.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Wind Energy:</b> Energy present in wind motion
that can be converted to mechanical energy for driving pumps, mills, and electric power
generators. Wind pushes against sails, vanes, or blades radiating from a central rotating
shaft.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Wood Energy:</b> Wood and wood products used as
fuel, including round wood (cord wood), limb wood, wood chips, bark, sawdust, forest
residues, charcoal, pulp waste, and spent pulping liquor.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana"><b>Wood Waste:</b> Wood byproducts used as a fuel.
Included are limb wood, wood chips, bark, sawdust, forest residues, charcoal, and pulp
waste.</font></p>
