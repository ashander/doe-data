<p><font SIZE="+0">A mail/electronic survey was conducted as part of the process to
collect information on the data needs of MECS customers. The collection time frame was May
1 through July 31, 1998. The survey portion has been completed, and the total results are
now available.</font></p>


<p><font SIZE="+0">During this three-month period, the electronic user-needs survey
received about 207 hits. Yet, only 15 of those hits resulted in the transmission of a
completed survey.</font></p>


<p><font SIZE="+0">Exactly 239 surveys were mailed to customers on the mailing list of the
MECS publication. A total of 50 completed surveys (21% response rate) were returned, 32 of
which resulted from a follow-up mail request.</font></p>


<p><font SIZE="+0">Only two surveys were returned by the 11 trade associations that were
identified as MECS users. Where appropriate, the replies of those two TRADE ASSOCIATIONS
have been duly noted by the use of capitalization.</font></p>


<p><font SIZE="+0">Of the 17 mail surveys in which Mr. Dwight French, Energy Consumption
Division Director, signed personalized salutations on the cover letter, 11 were returned.</font></p>

fuel-switching questions?</strong></font> 


<ul>
  <font SIZE="+0">
  <li>16 of the 65 returns expressed specific concerns or uncertainties about the proposed
    elimination of the fuel-switching collection from the survey, as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;This is important information in determining industries' flexibility.&quot; (govt.
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We do not use this info as much as the other categories, but we believe this will be
      of major interest to ESCOs targeting industrial customers.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Currently conducting a study for U.S. EPA on boilers, IC engines, turbines,
      incinerators, and preheaters. Need to know industries' capabilities to switch from certain
      fuels to alternative fuels, such as natural gas. The MECS is the best info source we've
      found by far. It would be a shame for such info to disappear, especially since
      fuel-switching info may see a surge in demand in the future.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Can help to determine overall Btu usage.&quot; (Edison Electric employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is important to the electric industry because the generation resource is often
      owned by others. If a large investment is made in plant and transmission, and the customer
      changes, that is stranded assets and lost revenue. Knowing fuel-switching capabilities is
      required to protect against lost load.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Necessary to evaluate options and impacts from short-term energy supply disruptions
      from natural disasters, weather, emergencies, etc., as well as to evaluate flexibility of
      end-use markets to respond, physically and economically, to long-term energy supply
      trends.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Keep it.&quot; (Dr. H. Merklein)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Would like to have this info for calculations 1) of potential load loss/gain and 2)
      impacts of fuel switching (environmental, other).&quot; (TRADE ASSOCIATION)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Yikes. In the past, we've had projects focused on fuel-switching analysis - mostly
      oil to gas/electricity/alternatives or gas to elec; not vice versa. Number of firms and
      Btu were most useful to us. MECS is <u>the</u> only source for fuel-switching data (beyond
      the AGA partial survey focused on residential and commercial customers). Why eliminate
      it?&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We will lose our backup information for peak winter and summer demand emergency
      planning (e.g., fuel oil in winter and electricity in summer).&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We are concerned that this information is important for emergency preparedness
      planning in the event that either oil supply or natural gas supply is interrupted. There
      are also economic advantages to fuel-switching capabilities that we might want to track in
      the future.&quot; (NYSERDA staff)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;If MECS eliminates the fuel-switching capabilities, it would eliminate the only
      unbiased source for manufacturers' fuel-switching capabilities.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Do not eliminate - loss of ongoing historical data base.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This (data) may have some relevance, but I suspect that capability would rapidly
      change if conditions changed, and so I think the data has little real value.&quot;
      (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This could be a problem with deregulation.&quot; (academia employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;My research needs vary from time to time, but fuel-switching capability info has a
      great potential for studies of economy-wide and sector-specific vulnerability and price
      elasticity.&quot; (academia employee)</dd>

questions?</strong></font> 


<ul>
  <font SIZE="+0">
  <li>17 of the 65 returns expressed specific concerns or uncertainties about the proposed
    elimination of the electric-motor collection from the survey, as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;Motors are one of the largest (and the most easily characterized across
      industries) sources of energy-efficiency potential in the industrial/manufacturing sector.
      Elimination of any info on this end use would affect the ability to target and capture
      that efficiency.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The electric motor data can be useful in our state.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This has proven very valuable, and will be more valuable now that the Xenergy study
      is available. It's critical input to Motor Challenge evaluation.&quot; (ACEEE employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I do have concern. Being involved in the Motor Challenge requires us to help people
      find info on motor systems, and the MECS has been a valuable source.&quot; (library
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Electric motors are the biggest users of electricity in many manufacturing plants.
      Info about the use of high-efficiency motors is very important.&quot; (Edison Electric
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This also affects DSM potential - knowledge of how much horse power is available
      gives clues to the market of variable-speed drives. It also is useful in regulating the
      transmission system.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Big problem - 60-75% of electric energy use in sector is for <u>motors</u>. To
      eliminate this would seriously hamper analysts' capabilities.&quot; (Prof. F. Sparrow)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We've had projects focused on electric motors exclusively. With an OIT program, a
      Climate Action initiative, and lots of voluntary actions, it's an important area for
      industrial analytical studies and voluntary compliance program design.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It is probably the only source of publicly available data for use in market
      assessment, market transformation, energy-efficiency program design, etc. Please do not
      delete.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Some quadrennial reports will have less info based on DOE information.&quot; (govt.
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It is useful and important to separate energy use in process areas versus motor
      systems.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We may lose the ability to monitor advances in efficiency and energy savings using
      an outside source.&quot; (academia employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is important. Motors account for 75% of energy used in manufacturing. This
      should be kept.&quot; (academia employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Do not eliminate.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I have not used that (motor) data, but it may be useful to our marketing folks in
      the future.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Yes (I have concerns), this is important to be able to forecast potential
      savings.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Motors dominate industrial electricity consumption. Due to this dominance and the
      relatively high cost of electricity, motor detail should be maintained.&quot; (researcher)<br>

  <li>One encouraging response was received, as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;Considering the variety of motors at a plant and the nature of response made to
      your questionnaire at the plant, the information you have gathered is of very limited
      value, and it is being misused by analysts.&quot; (Prof. M. Ross)</dd>

<ul>
  <font SIZE="+0">
  <li>8 of the 65 returns expressed specific concerns or uncertainties about the proposed
    addition of the purchased-electricity collection to the survey, as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;My thoughts on electricity prices - basically, I believe it is none of the
      government's business where power or fuel is purchased nor what it costs.&quot;
      (manufacturing employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;As a reporter, I am opposed to expanding the survey. Specific sites likely will not
      know this information unless they are doing their own purchasing. I believe there is
      enough data on utility/nonutility generation for any necessary analysis.&quot; (utility
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;My own feeling is you need to expand coverage of self and cogenerated electricity,
      not purchased.&quot; (Prof. F. Sparrow)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Existing questions and information are adequate. Additional efforts cannot be
      justified.&quot; (manufacturing employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This information is unlikely to be valuable <u>this</u> <u>time</u> due to the
      transitional nature of the electrical utility market. To be useful, it would be necessary
      to have state-level data.&quot; (ACEEE employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Yes (I have concerns), but these purchases won't be on long-term contracts, and the
      price volatility will be eliminated in an 'annual' or 'average' price. Interest is in
      futures, spot, and emergency purchases. And there'll be lots of differences. How will you
      reconcile the costs to present a rational table?&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;If one has an agent or marketer providing electricity, it could come from many
      sources and be very burdensome to supply.&quot; (TRADE ASSOCIATION)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;My concern is whether your plant-level respondents can answer a question reliably.
      In this case, using billing data, they may be able to.&quot; (Prof. M. Ross)<br>
      <br>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <li>Some encouraging responses were received, as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;A discussion of types of rate structures would be of interest.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is very important! However, I might add that joint ownership of onsite
      generation, or even onsite power owned by other entities, is an important issue that
      should be carefully tracked. The issue of who the establishment is and how much
      'over-the-fence' action is going on is important, too!&quot; (Dr. G. Boyd)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;OK to add as long as you define the term 'utility' and 'nonutility'
      appropriately.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This (collection) would ease some of the data backup and cross checking with data
      that we independently collect.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We think this (collection) is necessary to make the data useful in the future.&quot;
      (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Nonutility source info is becoming essential.&quot; (academia employee)<br>

<p><font SIZE="+0"><strong>5B) What are customer concerns if the MECS adds greenhouse-gas
questions?</strong></font> 


<ul>
  <font SIZE="+0">
  <li>21 of the 65 returns expressed specific concerns or uncertainties about the proposed
    addition of the greenhouse-gas collection (emissions/reductions) to the survey, as
    follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;No to collection of GHG data. This is a troublesome proposal in that many of us do
      not have measuring or estimating methodologies for these substances. It will be a

      burdensome exercise to ask sites to report such data for 1998. Probably a two-year or
      three-year advance warning with hearings and a comment period should occur before any
      attempt to collect this data from the many thousands of establishments surveyed. EIA is
      perfectly capable of imputing these GHG emissions from available fuel data and other
      sources and is already doing so for existing GHG inventory reporting purposes (even the
      EPA can do it). The accuracy of such data estimation is probably reasonable ...&quot;
      (manufacturing employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;As a reporter, I am opposed to further reporting. Greenhouse gas emissions are not
      required to be monitored, and data are not necessarily available. Sufficient information
      has already been published, and carbon emissions can be calculated from the fuel
      data.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Collecting this information would be a waste of funds.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Not useful - it can be calculated from energy use. A separate survey is not needed.
      Nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide are only a portion of the problem. Besides, atmospheric
      and oceanographic effects may mask many of the effects.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Existing data is adequate. Carbon dioxide predominantly comes from fuel combustion,
      and those use numbers are already obtained, just calculate the carbon dioxide with
      standard factors. Nitrous oxides are already estimated by EIA/EPA and reported by source
      through 1605(b). Additional efforts would be duplicative.&quot; (manufacturing employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ugh. We can calculate this, knowing the factors for each fuel. Waste of paper and no
      brainer.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The scientific evidence on trends in global warming is so uncertain it does not
      appear warranted to collection of any detailed information on these emissions at the
      present time.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Depends on what type of emissions. If you're going to put actual data in, put it all
      in - NUGs, utilities (public and private).&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;We don't need this directly now, but the suggestion begs the question of whose
      estimates of these emissions will you use, and are these emissions from power generation
      or from any source, such as the use of natural gas in an end use?&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Useful, but it may be unlikely that plants will be able to provide meaningful info.
      This information can be approximated from fuel-consumption data.&quot; (ACEEE employee)<br>

      <br>
      &quot;As people use the spot market for generation supply, emissions could change on an
      hourly basis. Also, you have to add in emissions from onsite generation and processes to
      get the whole story.&quot; (Edison Electric employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I don't think this is necessary unless you want to succumb to the 'Greenies.'&quot;
      (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Estimating carbon dioxide emissions from fuel use is easy, hence almost redundant to
      include in MECS. Other GHG emissions estimates would be useful if good data is actually
      collected, not estimated from 'rule of thumb.'&quot; (Pacific NW Lab employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Will you do this based on regional fuel mixes?&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Should be an EPA concern.&quot; (Dr. H. Merklein)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Why would you collect? If you have energy data, easy to estimate with decent
      accuracy. Seems burdensome for industry. Also, in their interest not to report too much!
      How reliable??&quot; (govt. employee in Canada)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Carbon dioxide emissions are easily obtained, non-CO2 gases might be helpful. I
      doubt we could get meaningful reduction estimates, but would love to see it if we
      can!&quot; (Dr. G. Boyd)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Do firms have data on nitrous oxides? Or will it be 'guesstimates?'&quot; (academia
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is a burdensome requirement. There is a voluntary reporting system available.
      Including this information in MECS moves it from voluntary to required. Don't do this
      until a treaty is ratified.&quot; (TRADE ASSOCIATION)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Wonder how this data would be measured and provided. Most industries have air
      emission permits, and I would be concerned about (industry) willingness and accuracy of
      data provided in this 'second' channel. This is a question of who and how - versus whether
      it would be valuable (it would).&quot; (researcher)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;My concern is whether your plant-level respondents can answer a question reliably. I
      doubt the value of this information. How would your respondent know (about emissions and
      reductions of greenhouse gases)?&quot; (Prof. M. Ross)<br>

  <li>Some encouraging responses were received, as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;Very important in determining carbon emissions.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Sort by onsite and utilities generating electricity. List carbon emission factors,
      regional electricity emission factors.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Useful - types of equipment and cost to eliminate gases helpful, not just what gases
      are emitted.&quot; (library employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Excellent idea! Ask what technologies (types of environmental control equipment) are
      used to reduce emissions (i.e., scrubbers, combustion, etc.).&quot; (energy-industry
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This will improve some reporting functions that will be growing. The legislature is
      increasingly interested in state and regional information. Current information is
      calculated.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Useful information. Would be good to include expenditures on reduction, if
      possible.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is a most important topic. Information is essential here.&quot; (academia

  <li>21 of the 65 returns provided additional comments, as follows:</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&quot;I would like to see commercial establishments by SIC codes, not just principal
      building codes.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Eliminate all price collection from MECS. Why? It no longer has any validity (i.e.,
      accuracy) for 'industrial' concerns that for the most part purchase their own gas and will
      soon buy their own electric energy, paying fees to utilities delivering the commodity. In
      addition to buying our own energy, some firms are buying resources in the ground (or
      generation assets), hedging, and using other financial instruments with the mix of these
      activities resulting in government-collected data that is useless for our class of
      consumer, as it soon will be for all classes of consumers. It certainly has no useful
      purpose for us! The rule of thumb should be, if a utility cannot provide the data, then it

      is not worth bothering the consumer for it. This would mean that the EIA will need to
      discontinue collecting consumer energy-price data because most consumers will, over time,
      stop paying the utility for the energy commodity. Rather than ask more questions of
      manufacturers, EIA needs to subscribe to a few energy publications to follow the real
      pricing trends in energy-commodity markets - these are sufficiently accurate for trends in
      'producer' pricing.&quot; (manufacturing employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I believe the major value from these types of surveys is the change across time,
      rather than a snapshot with a statistical variability that is greater than the change one
      would expect from the last survey. Sufficient sampling should be done to get the standard
      errors low enough on any data cell that a comparison to a prior survey is relevant.&quot;
      (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The cogen data (MECS pub - Table A13) is reported for facilities with a single type
      in place. If more than one type, the site is placed in the 'multiple' column. This makes
      tracking tech trends difficult. May be more useful to report all sites with each
      tech.&quot; (ACEEE employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Show national and regional median values for use and costs along with averages, and
      possibly the standard deviation.&quot; (Edison Electric employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I see there is a replacement for the SIC code. It is the NAICS. Maybe this should be
      phased in.&quot; (utility employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;MECS is the only comprehensive source of U.S. Industrial energy-use data. Please
      keep focused on making high-quality measurement of energy use by type and industry,
      nonfuel energy use, and components of electricity use.&quot; (Pacific NW Lab employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;If I can help in defending your budget, let me know.&quot; (Prof. F. Sparrow)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;More timely information!&quot; (govt. employee in Canada)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Industry information which is now SIC will need to be converted to NAICS. The timing
      of this is of interest to BEA.&quot; (govt. employee at BEA)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Eliminate divisional or regional where withholding of data is more than just one or
      two areas. Too many subdivisions are attempted with very little value.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Consumption data at 4-digit SIC and <u>state-level</u> detail would be ideal.&quot;
      (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I would love fewer W's and Q's. I understand why they're there, but it's incredibly
      frustrating if you're after certain numbers.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;From my other comments, you can see that certain people (admittedly inexperienced)
      are going to have trouble using the site. I could not tell whether you have what I need,
      and I just don't know where to look, or whether you just don't have it.&quot; (library
      employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The information in this (manufacturing) area is of most use to the engineers and
      Conservation Investment Program people. The rest of us (State of Minnesota - Dept. of
      Trade and Economic Development) are involved in annual and four-year reports for the
      legislature and general public.&quot; (govt. employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Any additional detail on key process industries (e.g., energy consumption at 5-digit
      level) would be helpful.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;MECS and EIA web site are great resources. More data and work are needed - not
      less.&quot; (academia employee)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The current amount of data you are collecting, and the cogent highlighting of the
      important attributes of these data in the presentation as well as discussions of the
      evolving trends, is very impressive. Keep up the good work.&quot; (consultant)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Keep the required inquiry as simple as possible!!!&quot; (TRADE ASSOCIATION)<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Please make MECS available as a complete download, similar to CBECS.&quot; (utility
      employee)<br>

      <br>
      &quot;It's not useful to know that, at a plant, there is at least one heat-recovery device
      or variable-speed motor! On the other hand, the info you collect on fuels and byproducts
      used as fuels at 4-digit level is very useful.&quot; (Prof. M. Ross)</dd>
