consumption; that is, purchases plus transfers in and generation from noncombustible
renewable resources, minus quantities sold and transferred out. First Use consumption
excludes quantities of energy that were produced from other energy inputs and, therefore,
avoids intra-establishment double-counting.</font></p>
<p>


<b><font face="Arial" size="3">Fossil Fuel:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"> Any naturally occurring organic fuel
formed in the Earth&#146;s crust, such as coal, crude oil, and natural gas.</font></p>

<b><font face="Arial" size="3">Fuel-Switching Capability:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"> The short-term capability of
a manufacturing establishment to have used substitute energy sources in place of those
actually consumed. Capability to use substitute energy sources means that the
establishment&#146;s combustors (for example, boilers, furnaces, ovens, and blast
furnaces) had the machinery or equipment either in place or available for installation so
that substitutions could actually have been introduced within 30 days without extensive
modifications. Fuel-switching capability does not depend on the relative prices of energy
sources; it depends only on the characteristics of the equipment and certain legal
constraints.</font></p>

gaseous element; the lightest of all gases.</font></p>
<p>


<b><font face="Arial" size="3">Indirect Uses (end-use category):</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"> The end-use category
that handles boiler fuel. Fuel in boilers is transformed into another useful energy
source, steam or hot water, which is in turn used in other end uses, such as process or
space heating or electricity generation. Manufacturers find measuring quantities of steam
as it passes through to various end uses especially difficult because variations in both
temperature and pressure affect energy content. Thus, the MECS does not present end-use
estimates of steam or hot water and shows only the amount of the fuel used in the boiler
to produce those secondary energy sources.</font></p>

system that includes mainlines (that is, pipelines designed to carry large volumes of gas,
usually located under roads or other major right-of-ways) and laterals (that is, pipelines
of smaller diameter that connect the end user to the mainline). Since the restructuring of
the gas industry, the sale of gas and/or delivery arrangements may be handled by other

when motors are found in equipment that is wholly contained in another end use (such as
process cooling and refrigeration), the energy is classified there rather than in machine
drive.</font></p>

transformation of materials or substances into new products. The other divisions of the
U.S. economy are agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and trapping; mining;
construction; transportation, communications, electric, gas, and sanitary services;
wholesale trade; retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; personal, business,
professional, repair, recreation, and other services; and public administration. The

<b><font face="Arial" size="3">Manufacturing Establishment:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"> An economic unit at a
single physical location where mechanical or chemical transformations of materials or
substances into new products are performed. Manufacturing operations are generally
conducted in facilities described as plants, factories, or mills, and characteristically

dollars were first converted to real 1992 dollars by dividing, or &quot;deflating,&quot;
the nominal dollars by the chain-type price indices for gross domestic product for 1991

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Energy produced offsite and consumed as a fuel </font></li>

represent total consumption as a fuel, regardless of where the energy was produced. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The consumption estimates for fuel use are not duplicative.
There is clearly no duplication for quantities that were produced offsite as well as for
those produced onsite from nonenergy sources. Quantities produced onsite from other energy
inputs result from consumption of an energy source as a feedstock or raw material input.
They do not result from the consumption of an energy as a fuel.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Examples of energy produced onsite from other energy

sources include </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Coke oven gas produced as a byproduct of the destructive

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Still gas produced in refineries as a result of
distillation, cracking, reforming, and other processes. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">From these examples, it is clear that the input energy was
not consumed as a fuel and would not have been included elsewhere. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The estimates of electricity and steam (note that steam is
included in the &quot;other&quot; energy category) must conform to the same criteria as
combustible energy. That is, they must represent</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">inputs to produce heat and power and to generate
electricity that do not duplicate energy content represented elsewhere in the table. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the case of electricity, the quantities generated onsite
by conventional generation or cogeneration must be excluded because the input fuels to
produce the electricity (coal, forexample) are already counted elsewhere. Thus, the
nonduplicative measure of electricity input for these tables is the same net electricity
estimate that appeared in </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="3">First Use of Energy for All Purposes. The same rationale
applies to steam. Onsite production is excluded because the input fuel would be counted
elsewhere. Thus, the allocation of energy to the various sources shown in the Total Inputs

Electricity Generation.</font></p>
