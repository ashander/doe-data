<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066">The Glossary is divided into six distinct sections:
General Terminology, Residential Sector, Commercial Buildings Sector, Transportation
Sector, Industrial Sector, and the U.S. Economy. </font></p>


<p align="center"><big><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>General Terminology</strong>
</font></big></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Behavioral Change</strong>: As it affects
energy efficiency, behavioral change is a change in energy-consuming activity originated
by, and under control of, a person or organization. An example of behavioral change is
adjusting a thermostat setting, or changing driving habits.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>British Thermal Unit (Btu)</strong>: The
quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water by 1 degree
Fahrenheit at or near 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Census Region</strong>: A geographic area
consisting of several States defined by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census. The four Census regions are:</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Northeast</strong>: Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, and
Pennsylvania</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Midwest</strong>: Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and

Washington</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Cooling Degree-Days (CDD)</strong>: A
measure of how hot a location was over a period of time, relative to a base temperature.
In this report, the base temperature is 65 degrees Fahrenheit; the period of time is 1
year. The CDD for a single day is the difference between that day's average temperature
and 65 degrees, if the daily average exceeds the base temperature, and zero if the daily
average is less than or equal to the base temperature. The CDD for a longer period of time
is the sum of the daily CDD from the days in the period.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Demand Indicator</strong>: A measure of the
number of energy-consuming units, or the amount of service or output, for which energy
inputs are required. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Establishment</strong>: As defined by the
1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual,&quot;...an economic unit generally at a
single physical location, where business is conducted or where services or industrial
operations are performed.&quot; (See <strong>Manufacturing Establishment</strong>.)</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>End Use</strong>: Any specific activity
performed by a sector (residential, commercial, industrial, or transportation) that
requires energy, e.g., refrigeration, space heating, water heating, manufacturing process,
feedstocks, etc.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: A value-based,
philosophical concept. In this report, two different concepts of energy efficiency are
discussed, a technical and a more broad, subjective concept. In the technical concept,
increases in energy efficiency take place when either energy inputs are reduced for a
given level of service or there are increased or enhanced services for a given amount of
energy inputs. In the more subjective concept, energy efficiency is the relative thrift or
extravagance with which energy inputs are used to provide goods or services.</font></p>


      <p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><a name="Energy Intensity"><strong>Energy 
        Intensity</strong></A>: The ratio of energy consumption to a measure of the 
        demand for services (e.g., number of buildings, total floorspace, floorspace-hours, 
        number of employees, or constant dollar value of Gross Domestic Product 
        for services). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Gross Domestic Purchases</strong>: The total
purchases by U.S. residents for all goods and services wherever produced, including
imports, but excluding exports. The scope of energy expenditures and price is more
consistent with that of gross domestic purchases than gross domestic product. Gross
domestic purchases figures are reported in real 1987 dollars, using the implicit price
deflator published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. See
Appendix A, &quot;Additional Measures of Energy Consumption, Expenditures, and
Prices&quot; in State Energy Price and Expenditure Report 1992 (DOE/EIA-0376(92)) for a
further treatment of the usage of gross domestic purchases.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong>: The
total value of goods and services produced by the Nation's economy before deduction of
depreciation charges and other allowances for capital consumption labor and property
located in the United States. It includes the total output of goods and services by
private consumers and government, gross private domestic capital investment, and net
foreign trade. GDP figures are reported in real 1987 dollars, using the implicit price
deflator published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Heating Degree-Days (HDD)</strong>: A
measure of how cold a location was over a period of time, relative to a base temperature.
In this report, the base temperature is 65 degrees Fahrenheit; the period of time is 1
year. The HDD for a single day is the difference between that day's average temperature
and 65 degrees, if the daily average is below the base temperature, and zero if the daily
average exceeds or equals the base temperature. The HDD for a longer period is the sum of
daily HDD for days in that period.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Normal Cooling Degree-Days</strong>: Annual
cooling degree-day average over 30 years from 1961 through 1990 as calculated by U.S.
Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Structural Change:</strong> As it affects
energy efficiency, structural change is a change in the relative levels of
energy-consuming subsectors within a sector. An example of structural change is change in
product or industry mix in the industrial sector.</font></p>

carried through pipelines, including natural gas, crude oil, and petroleum products
(excluding water). Energy is consumed by various electrical components of the pipeline,
including, valves, other, appurtenances attaches to the pipe, compressor units, metering
stations, regulator stations, delivery stations, holders and fabricated assemblies. This
report presents only oil pipeline freight.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Rail Freight</strong>: Refers to intercity
freight movement by trains.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Site Energy Consumption</strong>: This
includes gasoline, distillate fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas, jet fuel, residual oil,
natural gas, and electricity converted to their Btu equivalent. <strong>Primary energy
consumption</strong> also includes electrical losses.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Site Energy Consumption Conversion</strong>:
Electricity consumption is reported for pipelines and passenger rail in the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory Transportation Energy Data Book. The primary electricity volumes were
converted to site electricity applying conversion factors. See Appendix A for the
methodology.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Sport-Utility Vehicle</strong>: Includes
light trucks that are similar to Jeeps. Other common terms for these vehicles are sport,
special purpose, utility, or off-the-road vehicles. They may have a four- or two-wheel
drive.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Ton Miles</strong>: The product of the
distance freight is hauled, measured in miles, and the weight of the cargo being hauled,
measured in tons. Thus, moving one ton one mile generates one ton mile.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Truck</strong> <strong>Freight</strong>:
This is freight carried by single-unit, non-two-axle, four-tire trucks (Other single unit
trucks) and combination trucks.</font></p>

vehicles.</font></p>


<p align="center"><big><strong><font face="Arial" color="#000066">Industrial Sector </font></strong></big></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Byproduct Fuels</strong>: Secondary or
additional products resulting from the feedstock use of energy or the processing of
nonenergy materials. For examples, the more common byproducts of coke ovens are coal gas,
tar, and a mixture of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). Byproduct fuels are produced by
the use of both energy and nonenergy raw material input, but they appear differently on
various measures of energy consumption, depending on which one is being considered. For
instance, total input for heat, power, and electricity generation include both types of
byproduct fuels. In order to avoid double counting of primary energy, however, primary
energy consumption for all purposes does not include byproduct fuel resulting from the use
of other energy, but includes those resulting from the use of nonenergy sources as raw
material input.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Capacity-Utilization Rate</strong>: Equals
the seasonally adjusted index of industrial production divided by a capacity index
(sustainable practical capacity, i.e., the greatest level of output a plant can maintain
within a realistic work schedule). The Federal Reserve Board weights the capacity indexes
by value-added proportions. This methodology is described in Appendix A.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Feedstock Energy Consumption</strong>:
Includes all energy sources consumed as a raw material, and it is definitionally
equivalent to total primary consumption of energy for nonfuel purposes described in the
Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS).</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Gross Output</strong>: Gross output equals
shipments, minus cost of resale, plus changes in business inventories, coverage
adjustment, commodity taxes, and new force account construction (value of construction
undertaken with own labor, capital, etc.). All components are deflated to 1987 dollars.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis considers this to be the most comprehensive measure of
manufacturing production. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Gross Product Originating (GPO)</strong>:
The attribution of gross domestic product to industries or sectors of origin, as provided
by the National Income and Product Accounts of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. GPO is
compiled by summing income components--wages and salaries, capital, profits, etc.--and
corresponds in concept to value added. GPO deflators are used to convert current
dollar-denominated value added into 1987 constant dollars.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>High-Energy Consumers</strong>: Consists of
the major manufacturing groups Food and Kindred Products, Paper and Allied Products,
Chemicals and Allied Products, Petroleum and Coal Products, Stone, Clay and Glass
Products, and Primary Metal Industries. These firms convert raw materials into finished
goods primarily by chemical (and not by physical) means. Heat is essential to their
production, and steam provides much of the heat. Natural gas and byproduct and waste fuels
are the largest sources of energy for this group.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>High-Value Added Consumers</strong>:
Producers of high value-added transportation vehicles, industrial machinery, electrical
equipment, instruments, and miscellaneous equipment. The primary end uses are motor-driven

physical conversion of materials (cutting, forming, assembly) and heat treating, drying
and bonding. Natural gas is the principal energy source for these firms. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Industrial Production</strong>: The Federal
Reserve Board calculates this index by compiling indices of physical output from a variety
of agencies and trade groups, weighting each index by the Census' value added, and adding
it to the cost of materials. When physical measures are not available, the Federal Reserve
Board uses the number of production workers or amount of electricity consumed as the basis
for the index. To convert industrial production into dollars, multiply by the &quot;real
value added&quot; estimate used by the Federal Reserve Board.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Industrial Sector</strong>: As defined by
EIA, Comprises manufacturing industries, which make up the largest part of the sector,
along with mining, construction, agriculture, fisheries, and forestry. Establishments in
the sector range from steel mills and small farms to companies assembling electronic
components. The SIC codes 20 through 39 are used to classify establishments as industrial.<strong>
</strong>A subdivision of U.S. economic activity defined by EIA to include manufacturing,
construction, mining, agriculture, fishing, and forestry (nonmanufacturing)
establishments.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Inventories</strong>: Year-end inventories
at cost or market value, deflated to 1987 constant dollars using value of shipments
implicit price deflators reported by Bureau of Economic Analysis.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Low-Energy Consumers</strong>: This group is
the smallest energy consuming sector and represents a combination of end use requirements.
Motor drive is one of the key end uses. Included in this group are tobacco firms, textile
mills, lumber mills, rubber and plastics plants, printing and publishing operations, and
furniture, apparel, and leather makers.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Major Industry Groups</strong>: Two-digit
SIC industries, 1-39.</font></p>

economic unit at a single physical location where mechanical or chemical transformation of
materials or substances into new products are performed. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Manufacturing Sector</strong>: One of 10
fields of economic activity defined by the Standard Industrial Classification Manual,
including two-digit SIC industries 20-39. It includes all establishments engaged in the
mechanical or chemical transformation of materials or substances into new products. The
establishments in the manufacturing sector constitute the universe for MECS.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Total Consumption of Energy for All Purposes</strong>:
This measure includes offsite-produced energy, feedstocks energy, and onsite byproduct
fuels resulting from the use of a nonenergy materials as feedstocks. It excludes
electricity losses, as well as byproduct fuels resulting from the use of energy sources as
raw materials. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Nonmanufacturing</strong>: Includes
agriculture, construction, mining, and resource extraction.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Offsite-Produced Energy for Heat, Power and
Electricity Generation</strong>: This measure of energy consumption, which is equivalent
to purchased energy includes energy produced off-site and consumed onsite. It excludes
energy produced and consumed onsite, energy used as raw material input, and electricity
losses.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)</strong>:
A classification scheme developed by the Office of Management and Budget that categorizes
establishments into groups with similar economic activities.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Total Inputs of Energy for Heat, Power, and
Electricity Generation</strong>: This measure of energy consumption includes
offsite-produced energy and byproduct fuels resulting from the use of both energy and
nonenergy materials as feedstocks. However, it excludes feedstocks and electricity losses.
Reported in trillion or quadrillion Btu and referred to as <strong>Inputs of Energy</strong>
in this report.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Value Added</strong>: For the manufacturing
and mining sectors, it is a measure of activity derived by subtracting the cost of
materials, supplies, containers, purchased fuel and electricity, and contract work from
the value of shipments (products manufactured or mined plus receipts for services
rendered). This calculation is adjusted by adding the value added by merchandising
(mark-up) and the net change in finished goods and work-in-progress inventories. For
industries in which value of production is collected instead of value of shipments, value
added is adjusted by the change in work-in-progress inventories. Deflated to 1987 constant
dollars using GPO deflator.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Value of Production</strong>: Calculated as
the value of shipments plus inventory change during the year (subtract prior year-end from
current year-end inventories) in constant 1987 dollars.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Value of Shipments</strong>: Received or
receivable net selling values (exclusive of freight and taxes) of all primary and
secondary products shipped, as well as all miscellaneous receipts for contract work
performed for others, installation and repair, sales of scrap, and sales of products
bought and resold without further processing. Deflated to constant 1987 dollars using GPO
deflators.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066"><strong>Structurally-Adjusted Estimates</strong>:
Aggregate energy-intensity changes in the manufacturing sector, from which energy
efficiency changes may be inferred, include real efficiency changes, changes due to
structural shifts in the economy, and interaction effects. Separation of structural
effects from manufacturing energy-intensity is achieved by characterizing the economy in
such a way that changing composition of the manufacturing sector is measured by changes in
the relative output (or changes in the share of output).</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" color="#000066">It must be emphasized that the extent to which
structural shifts can be eliminated from intensity measurement depends on the level of
disaggregation. For instance, disaggregation at the four-digit SIC level would yield a
better result than that at the three-digit SIC level, while disaggregation at the
three-digit SIC level would yield a better result than that at the two-digit level.</font></p>
