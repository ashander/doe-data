        Usually one or more legally incorporated cities within the Metropolitan

        System:</strong> Diesel engines are internal combustion engines that burn 
        diesel oil rather than gasoline. Injectors are used to spray droplets 
        of diesel oil into the combustion chambers, at or near the top of the 
        compression stroke. Ignition follows due to the very high temperature 
        of the compressed in-take air, or to the use of &quot;glow plugs,&quot; 
        which retain heat from previous ignitions (spark plugs are not used). 
        Diesel engines are generally more fuel economic than gasoline engines, 
        but must be stronger and heavier due to high compression ratios. See <strong>Diesel

        the amount used by the household during the 365- or 366-day period. For 
        fuel oil, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), the quantity consists 
        of fuel purchased, not fuel consumed. If the level of fuel in the storage 
        tank was the same at the beginning and end of the annual period, then 
        the quantity consumed would be the same as the quantity purchased. Information 
        on the level of fuel in the storage tank was not included in the data 
        collection. The time period for household consumption for energy used 
        in the home is January 1993 through December 1993 and was collected during

        from all sources before taxes and deductions as collected in the 1993 
        RECS. It includes wages, salaries, tips, commissions, income from Social 
        Security, pensions, interest, dividends, rent, public assistance, and 
        unemployment insurance. This includes the total income for all family 
        members who lived in the household in 1993. Income of nonfamily members 
        of the household is not included. &quot;Family&quot; includes the following 
        types of relationships: mother, father, sister, brother, son, daughter, 
        father-in-law, uncle, aunt, niece, grandchild, foster child, and similar

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fuel Injection:</strong> 
        A fuel delivery system whereby gasoline is pumped to one or more fuel 
        injectors under high pressure. The fuel injectors are valves that, at 
        the appropriate times, open to allow fuel to be sprayed or atomized into 
        a throttle bore or into the intake manifold ports. The fuel injectors 
        are usually solenoid operated valves under the control of the vehicle's 
        on-board computer (thus the term &quot;electronic fuel injection&quot;). 
        The efficiency of fuel-injection systems is less temperature dependent 
        than carburetor systems. Diesel engines always use injectors. See <strong>Carburetor 
        </strong>and <strong>Diesel Fuel Systems.</strong> </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Hot-Deck Imputation:</strong> 
        A statistical procedure for deriving a probable response to a questionnaire 
        item concerning a household or vehicle, where no response was given during 
        the survey. To perform the procedure, the households or vehicles are sorted 
        by variables related to the missing item. Thus, a series of &quot;sort 
        categories&quot; are formed, which are internally homogeneous with respect 
        to the sort variables. Within each category, households or vehicles for 
        which the questionnaire item is not missing are randomly selected to serve 
        as &quot;donors&quot; to supply values for the missing item of &quot;recipient&quot; 
        households or vehicles. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Household:</strong> 
        A family, an individual, or a group of up to nine unrelated persons occupying 
        the same housing unit at the time of the 1993 RECS interview. &quot;Occupy&quot; 
        means the housing unit was the person's usual or permanent place of residence 
        at the time of the first field contact. The household includes babies, 
        lodgers, boarders, employed persons who live in the housing unit, and 
        persons who usually live in the household but are away traveling or in 
        a hospital. The household does not include persons who are normally members 
        of the household but who were away from home as college students or members 
        of the armed forces at the time of the contact. The household does not 
        include persons temporarily visiting with the household if they have a 
        place of residence elsewhere, persons who take their meals with the household 
        but usually lodge or sleep elsewhere, domestic employees or other persons 
        employed by the household who do not sleep in the same housing unit, or 
        persons who are former members of the household, but have since become 
        inmates of correction or penal institutions, mental institutions, homes 
        for the aged or needy, homes or hospitals for the chronically ill or handicapped, 
        nursing homes, convents or monasteries, or other places in which residents 
        may remain for long periods of time. By definition, the number of households 
        is the same as the number of occupied housing units. The number or households 
        for a subgroup or table cell is estimated by summing the survey weights 
        over all sample households in that subgroup. </font></p>

        Fuel:</strong> The primary fuel delivered to a residential site. It may 
        be converted to some other form of energy at the site. The following are 
        defined as primary fuels for this report: </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Electricity</em>: 
        Metered electric power supplied by a central utility company to a residence 
        via underground or above-ground power lines. It does not refer to electricity 
        generated onsite for the exclusive use of a residence. When a residence 
        has its own generating capability, the fuel used for the generator will 
        be specified. The Btu equivalent for electricity is the energy value of 
        electricity as received by the household (3,412 Btu per kilowatthour). 
        For this report, energy losses that occur in generating and transmitting 
        electricity are not included in the conversion of electricity into a Btu 
        equivalent. If these losses were to be included, the conversion rate would 
        generally be about 10,353 Btu per kilowatthour. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Fuel Oil</em>: 
        No. 1, No. 2, or No. 4 grade fuel oil or residual oil that is burned for 
        space- or water-heating purposes. No. 1 distillate fuel oil is a form 
        of heating oil used mostly as a blending stock to insure that heavier 
        grades of fuel flow under severe cold weather conditions. No. 2 distillate 
        refers to both No. 2 heating oil and No. 2 diesel fuel. Although these 
        products are not identical, they are essentially interchangeable for most 
        applications. No. 2 fuel oil is the most common form of heating oil. No. 
        4 distillate is a blend of No. 2 and No. 5 or No. 6 residual fuel oil, 
        used in large stationary diesel engines and boilers equipped with fuel 
        preheating equipment. Residual fuel oil refers to the heavier oils that 
        remain after the distillate fuel oils and lighter hydrocarbons are boiled 
        off in refinery operations. </font></p>
      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></p> <em>Kerosene</em>: 
      The generic name for a distilled product of oil or coal, having properties 
      similar to those of No. 1 fuel oil. Kerosene is used for cooking stoves, 
      for space heating or water heating, or for lighting equipment that uses 
      wicks. It is sometimes sold under the names &quot;range oil,&quot; &quot;stove 
      oil,&quot; or &quot;coal oil.&quot; </p> &nbsp; </p> 
      </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2"><em>Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)</em>: Any fuel gas supplied to a residence 
        in liquid form, such as propane or butane. It is usually delivered by 
        tank truck and stored near the residence in a tank or cylinder until used. 
        Propane was the most common liquefied petroleum gas supplied to RECS households. 
        Household use of LPG solely for outdoor gas grills is not considered sufficient 
        use to mark the household as a user of LPG. </font></p><font size="2"></p>
      <em>Natural Gas</em>: Utility gas supplied by underground pipeline to individual 
      housing units by a central utility company. It does not refer to privately 
      owned gas wells operated by the household, nor to LPG. </p> 
      <p><strong>Mean:</strong> The simple arithmetic average for a population; 
        that is, the sum of all the values in a population divided by the size 
        of the population. For this report, population means are estimated by 
        computing the weighted sum of the sample values, then dividing by the 
        sum of the sample weights. The mean is, thus, an aggregate ratio whose 
        denominator is the total number of households or vehicles. See <strong>Ratio 
        Estimate</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Measured Heated Area of Residence:</strong> The floor area of 
        the housing unit that is enclosed from the weather and heated as collected 
        in the 1993 RECS. Basements are included whether or not they contain finished 
        space. Garages are included if they have a wall in common with the house. 
        Attics that have finished space and attics that have some heated space 
        are included. Crawl spaces are not included even if they are enclosed 
        from the weather. Sheds and other buildings that are not attached to the 
        house are not included. &quot;Measured&quot; area means that the measurement 
        of the dimensions of the home did not rely on the respondent's reports 
        but was an actual measurement by the interviewer using a metallic, retractable, 
        50-foot tape measure. &quot;Heated area&quot; is that portion of the measured 
        area that is heated during most of the season. Rooms that are shut off 
        during the heating season to save on fuel are not counted. Attached garages 
        that are unheated and unheated areas in the attics and basements are also 
        not counted. </p>
      <p><strong>Metropolitan</strong>: See <strong>Urban</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA):</strong> Areas defined by 
        the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in 1992. An MSA is (1) a county 
        or group of contiguous counties that contain at least one city of 50,000 
        inhabitants or more, or (2) an urbanized area of at least 50,000 inhabitants 
        and a total MSA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). 
        The contiguous counties are included in an MSA if, according to certain 
        criteria, they are essentially metropolitan in character and are socially 
        and economically integrated with the central city. In New England, MSAs 
        consist of towns and cities, rather than counties. (See <strong>Urban</strong>, 
        <strong>Central City</strong>, <strong>Suburban</strong>, and <strong>Rural</strong>.) 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Metropolitan Status:</strong> Refers to the geographic location 
        of the households in relationship to MSA's. See <strong>Metropolitan, 
        Nonmetropolitan,</strong> and <strong>Central City.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Miles per Gallon (mpg):</strong> A measure of vehicle fuel economy. 
        Miles per gallon (mpg) as presented in this report represents &quot;fleet 
        miles per gallon.&quot; For each subgroup or &quot;table cell,&quot; mpg 
        is computed as the ratio of the total number of miles traveled by all 
        vehicles in the subgroup to the total number of gallons consumed. For 
        the 1994 RTECS, mpg values were assigned to each vehicle using the EPA 
        certification files and adjusted for on-road driving. </p>

        Statistical Area (MSA).</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Number of Cylinders:</strong> In a reciprocating engine, a cylinder 
        is the chamber in which combustion of fuel occurs and the piston moves, 
        ultimately delivering power to the wheels. Common engine configurations 
        include 4, 6, and 8 cylinders. Generally, the more cylinders a vehicle 
        has, the greater the amount of engine power it has. However, more cylinders 
        often result in less fuel economy. See <strong>Engine Size.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Number of Households:</strong> The total number of households 
        in the United States that are represented by the sample households. In 
        this report, most statistics are shown for the number of households with 
        vehicles, which is a subset of the total number of households. </p>
      <p><strong>Number of Vehicles:</strong> See <strong>Vehicle </strong>and 
        <strong>Vehicle Stock.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Occupied Housing Unit:</strong> A unit someone was living in 
        as his or her usual or permanent place of residence when the first field 
        contact was made. See <strong>Housing Unit.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>On-Road Miles per Gallon (mpg):</strong> A composite mpg that 
        was adjusted to account for the difference between the test value and 
        the fuel economy actually obtained on the road. </p>
      <p><strong>Origin:</strong> The primary ethnic background of the person 
        considered to be the householder as self-determined by the respondent. 
        Origin of householder was collected in the 1993 RECS. Each respondent 
        was asked, &quot;Which of the groups on this exhibit best describes the 
        householder?&quot; The groups included: white, black or Negro, American 
        Indian, Alaskan native, Asian, and Pacific Islander. The word &quot;race&quot; 
        was not used in either the questionnaire or the instructions. See <strong>Hispanic

        trucks. See <strong>Vehicle.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Poverty:</strong> Low-income classifications to which certain 
        households are assigned based on the household's annual income reported 
        in the 1993 RECS. &quot;Below 100 percent of poverty&quot; encompasses 
        a group of households with incomes below the poverty level as defined 
        by the Bureau of the Census. &quot;Below 125 percent of poverty&quot; 
        includes a group of households with incomes below 125 percent of the poverty 
        level. These groups of the poor and near-poor represent </p>
      <p>alternative levels for defining poverty. The definitions of &quot;poor&quot; 
        are based on the number of family members in the household and the income 
        of the entire family. </p>
      <p><strong>Premium-Grade Gasoline:</strong> A grade of unleaded gasoline 
        with a high octane rating, (approximately 92) designed to minimize preignition 
        or engine &quot;knocking&quot; by slowing combustion rates. See <strong>Regular-Grade 
        Gasoline</strong> and <strong>Intermediate-Grade Gasoline.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Predictive Mean Matching:</strong> A model-based procedure used 
        to impute for item nonresponse. This method uses logistic models to compute 
        predicted means that are used to statistically match each nonrespondent 
        to a respondent with the closest predicted mean. The respondent's value 
        is directly imputed to the nonrespondent. </p>
      <p><strong>Price:</strong> The dollar amount per gallon of fuel purchased. 
        For the 1994 RTECS, fuel prices were not collected directly from the respondent. 
        Instead fuel prices were estimated from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
        Retail Pump Price Survey and from the Lundberg Survey Inc. Prices </p>
      <p><strong>Primary Sampling Unit (PSU):</strong> A sampling unit selected 
        at the first stage in multistage area probability sampling. A PSU typically 
        consists of one to several contiguous counties--for example, a metropolitan 
        area with surrounding suburban counties. The approximately 3,100 counties 
        and independent cities of the contiguous United States were grouped into 
        about 1,800 PSUs by a procedure similar to the one used by the Census 
        Bureau for its Current Population Survey. PSUs can be composed of one 
        or more MSAs or can be composed of rural counties. </p>
      <p><strong>PSU:</strong> See <strong>Primary Sampling Unit.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Quadrillion:</strong> The number 1,000,000,000,000,000 or 10<sup>15</sup>. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ratio Estimate:</strong> The ratio of two population aggregates 
        (totals). For example, &quot;average miles traveled per vehicle&quot; 
        is the ratio of total miles driven by all vehicles, over the total number 
        of vehicles, within any subgroup or &quot;table cell.&quot; In this report, 
        there are two types of ratio estimates: those computed using aggregates 
        for vehicles and those computed using aggregates for households. See <strong>Mean</strong>.

      <p><strong>Rear-Wheel Drive:</strong> See <strong>Type of Drive.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p><strong>RECS:</strong> See <strong>Residential Energy Consumption Survey 
        (RECS).</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Regression Imputation:</strong> A statistical technique for predicting 
        the value of a numerical variable that is missing. The technique involves 
        developing a regression equation that predicts the value of the missing 
        variable based upon variables that are not missing or have already been 
        imputed. </p>
      <p><strong>Regular-Grade Gasoline:</strong> A grade of unleaded gasoline 
        with a lower octane rating (approximately 87) than other grades. Octane 
        boosters are added to gasoline to control engine preignition or &quot;knocking&quot; 
        by slowing combustion rates. See <strong>Intermediate-Grade Gasoline</strong> 
        and <strong>Premium-Grade Gasoline</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Relative Standard Error:</strong> See <strong>RSE (Relative Standard 
        Error)</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Residential:</strong> Occupied housing units, including mobile 
        homes, single-family housing units (attached and detached), and apartments. 
        The definition of &quot;occupied housing units&quot; is the same as that 
        used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. See <strong>Household </strong>and 
        <strong>Housing Unit.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS):</strong> A national 
        multistage probability sample survey conducted by the Energy End Use Division 
        of the Energy Information Administration. The RECS provides baseline information 
        on how households in the United States use energy. The RTECS sample is 
        a subset of the RECS. Household demographic characteristics reported in 
        the RTECS publication are collected during the RECS personal interview. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>RSE (Relative Standard Error):</strong> A measure of the reliability 
        or precision of a survey statistic. Variability occurs in survey statistics 
        because the different samples that could be drawn would each produce different 
        values for the survey statistics. The RSE is a measure of precision on 
        a percentage scale. The RSE is defined as the standard error of a survey 
        estimate, divided by the survey estimate and multiplied by 100. (Standard 
        error is the square root of the variance.) For example, an RSE of 50 percent 
        means that the standard error is half as large as the survey estimate. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>RSE Column Factor:</strong> An adjustment factor that appears 
        above each column of the tables and is used to compute RSEs. For a survey 
        estimate in a particular row and column of a table (that is, a particular 
        &quot;cell&quot;), the approximate RSE is obtained by multiplying the 
        RSE row factor by the RSE column factor for that cell. See <strong>RSE 
        </strong>and<strong> RSE Row Factor.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>RSE Row Factor:</strong> A factor that appears to the right of 
        each row of the tables, and is used to compute RSE's. For a survey estimate 
        in a particular row and column of a table (that is, a particular &quot;cell&quot;), 
        the approximate RSE is obtained by multiplying the RSE row factor by the 
        RSE column factor for that particular cell. The row factor is equal to 
        the geometric mean of the RSE's in a particular row of the tables. See 
        <strong>RSE and RSE Column Factor</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Rural:</strong> Households not located within Metropolitan Statistical 
        Areas as defined by the U.S. Office of Management </p>
      <p>and Budget for 1993. See <strong>Metropolitan Statistical Area</strong> 
        and <strong>Urban Status</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Sampling:</strong> The procedure used to select housing units 
        for interview from the population of residential housing units in the 
        United States. See <strong>Multistage Area Probability Sample</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Self-Service or Mini-Service:</strong> See <strong>Type of Primary 
        Service.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Shortfall:</strong> See <strong>Miles-per-Gallon (mpg) Shortfall</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sport-Utility Vehicle:</strong> Includes light trucks that are 
        similar to jeeps. Other common terms for these vehicles are sport-utility, 
        special purpose, utility or off-the-road vehicles. They may have a four- 
        or two-wheel drive. See <strong>Vehicle.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Suburban:</strong> Those parts of the MSA that are not designated 
        as central city. Suburban areas are referred to as &quot;outside central 
        city.&quot; See <strong>Metropolitan Statistical Area</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Transmission Type:</strong> The householder was asked if each 
        vehicle had an automatic or manual shift transmission. The transmission 
        is the part of a vehicle that transmits motive force from the engine to 
        the wheels, usually by means of gears for different speeds using either 
        a hydraulic &quot;torque-converter&quot; (automatic) or clutch assembly 
        (manual). On front wheel drive cars, the transmission is often called 
        a &quot;transaxle.&quot; Fuel economy is usually higher with manual transmissions 
        than automatic transmissions, although newer automatic transmissions are 
        narrowing the difference. </p>
      <p><strong>Transportation Energy Expenditures:</strong> See <strong>Vehicle 
        Fuel Expenditures</strong> and <strong>Combined Household Energy Expenditures</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Type of Drive:</strong> Refers to which wheels the engine power 
        is delivered to, the so-called &quot;drive wheels.&quot; Rear-wheel drive, 
        has drive wheels on the rear of the vehicle. Front-wheel drive, a newer 
        technology, has drive wheels on the front of the vehicle. Four-wheel drive 
        uses all four wheels as drive wheels, and is found mostly on sport-utility 
        vehicles and trucks, though it is becoming increasingly more common on 
        station wagons and vans. </p>
      <p><strong>Type of Fuel System:</strong> See <strong>Carburetor, Fuel-Injection, 
        </strong>and <strong>Diesel Fuel Systems.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Type of Vehicle Fuel Purchased:</strong> The predominant type 
        of fuel purchased during 1994. Data categories are leaded and unleaded 
        gasoline, diesel motor fuel, and &quot;other&quot; which includes propane 
        and gasohol. See <strong>Gasoline, Gasohol, Unleaded Gasoline, Leaded 
        Gasoline, Regular-Grade Gasoline, Intermediate-Grade Gasoline, </strong>and 
        <strong>Premium- Grade Gasoline.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Type of Primary Service:</strong> The dominant type of service 
        the respondent uses at the service station. Response categories include 
        &quot;full-service pumps,&quot; &quot;self- or mini-service pumps,&quot; 
        or &quot;both equally.&quot; Mini-service is provided when attendants 
        pump the vehicle fuel but do not provide any other service, such as checking 
        the tire pressure. </p>
      <p><strong>Urban</strong>: Urban refers to a group of households located 
        within Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) as defined by the U.S. Office 
        of Management and Budget in 1993. For this report, urban is composed of 
        central city and suburban areas. An MSA is (1) a county or group of contiguous 
        counties that contain at least one city of 50,000 inhabitants or more, 
        or (2) an urbanized area of at least 50,000 inhabitants and a total MSA 
        population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). The contiguous 
        counties are included in an MSA if, according to certain criteria, they 
        are essentially metropolitan in character and are socially and economically 
        integrated with the central city. In New England, MSAs consist of towns 
        and cities rather than counties. (See <strong>Central City</strong>, <strong>Suburban</strong>, 
        and <strong>Rural.</strong>) </p>
      <p><strong>Unleaded Gasoline:</strong> Contains not more than 0.05 gram 
        of lead per gallon and not more than 0.005 gram of phosphorus per gallon. 
        Premium, regular and intermediate grades are included, depending on the 
        octane rating. See <strong>Gasoline, Leaded Gasoline, Regular-Grade Gasoline, 
        Intermediate-Grade Gasoline,</strong> and <strong>Premium-Grade Gasoline.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Van:</strong> Includes large vans. Generally, the distinction 
        between large vans and minivans is made by the respondents' answers to 
        &quot;Type of Vehicle&quot; question. Exceptions were: (1) Volkswagen 
        vans were categorized as minivans, and (2) all other pre-1983 vans were 
        categorized as vans. </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle:</strong> For the RTECS, vehicles were any motorized 
        vehicles used by U.S. households for personal transportation. Excluded 
        were: motorcycles, mopeds, large trucks, and buses. Included were: automobiles, 
        station wagons, passenger vans, cargo vans, motor homes, pickup trucks, 
        and sport-utility or similar vehicles. In order to be included, vehicles 
        must be: (1) owned by members of the household; (2) company cars not owned 
        by household members but regularly available to household members for 
        their personal use and are ordinarily kept at home; or (3) rented or leased 
        for 1 month or more. See <strong>Vehicle Stock, Vehicles Used on the Job, 
        Automobile, Minivans, Vans, Pickup Trucks,</strong> <strong>and Sport-Utility 
        Vehicles.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Acquisition:</strong> The number of vehicles a household 
        acquires or obtains during the RTECS survey year. The average number of 
        vehicles in the stock is computed using these data. See <strong>Vehicle 
        Disposition.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Disposition:</strong> The number of vehicles a household 
        disposes of during the RTECS survey year. Disposed vehicles include those 
        sold, traded, or the owner moved out of the household. The average number 
        of vehicles in the stock is computed using these data. See <strong>Vehicle 
        Acquisition.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Fuel Consumption:</strong> Vehicle fuel consumption is 
        computed as the vehicle-miles traveled divided by the fuel economy reported 
        in miles per gallon (mpg). For the 1994 RTECS, vehicle fuel consumption 
        was derived from the actual vehicle mileage collected in the RTECS and 
        the assigned mpg values were obtained from the EPA certification files 
        and adjusted for on-road driving. </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Fuel Economy:</strong> See <strong>Miles per Gallon (mpg)</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Fuel Expenditures:</strong> The cost, including taxes, 
        of the gasoline, gasohol or diesel fuel added to the vehicle's tank. Expenditures 
        do not include the cost of oil or other items that may have been purchased 
        at the same time as the vehicle fuel. </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Identification Number (VIN):</strong> A set of codes, 
        usually alpha-numeric characters, assigned to a vehicle at the factory 
        and inscribed on the vehicle. When decoded, the VIN provides vehicle characteristics. 
        The VIN was used in the 1994 RTECS to help match vehicles to the EPA certification 
        file for calculating miles-per-gallon values. See <strong>Environmental 
        Protection Agency (EPA) Certification Files.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle-Miles Traveled (VMT):</strong> The number of miles traveled 
        nationally by the RTECS vehicles for a period of 1 year. In the RTECS, 
        VMT were either calculated using two odometer readings or, for vehicles 
        with less than two odometer readings, imputed using a regression estimate. 
        See <strong>Average Vehicle-Miles Traveled.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Stock:</strong> The number of vehicles owned or used 
        by a household for personal transportation. In the RTECS, with the exception 
        of the statistics reported as of July 1994, a vehicle was defined in terms 
        of a &quot;vehicle year.&quot; If a vehicle was present in a household 
        for the entire year, it was counted as one vehicle. If a vehicle was present 
        in a household for one-half of the year, it was counted as only one-half 
        of a vehicle. Therefore, the number of vehicles a sample household was 
        considered as having during the survey year was computed as the days of 
        possession summed over all vehicles in the household, divided by 366 days 
        (1994 was a leap year). See <strong>Average Number of Vehicles</strong> 
        and <strong>Vehicles</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Vehicle Used on the Job:</strong> A vehicle used by anyone in 
        the household for job-related activities, excluding commuting to and from 
        work. These vehicles are included in the RTECS. See <strong>Vehicle.</strong> 
      </p>
