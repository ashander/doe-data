<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"><b>Introduction</b></font></strong> </p>


<p>This appendix discusses several issues relating to the quality of the Residential
Transportation Energy Consumption Survey (RTECS) data and to the interpretation of
conclusions based on these data. The first section discusses undercoverage of the vehicle
stock in the residential sector. The second section discusses the effects of using July
1994 as a time reference for the survey. The remainder of this appendix discusses the
treatment of sampling and nonsampling errors in the RTECS, the quality of specific data
items such as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and fuel prices, and
poststratification procedures used in the 1994 RTECS. </p>


<p>The quality of the data collection and the processing of the data affects the accuracy
of estimates based on survey data. All the statistics published in this report such as
total vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) are estimates of population values. These estimates are
based on observations from a randomly chosen subset of the entire population of occupied
housing units. Consequently, the estimates always differ from the true population values.
Because the RTECS is a sample survey, data from the 1994 RTECS are subject to various
sources of nonsampling and sampling error. </p>


<p>Nonsampling error is a measure of variability due to the conduct of the survey. These
errors can include: population undercoverage during sampling; questionnaire wording and
format; response bias and variance; interviewer error; coding and/or keypunching error;
and nonresponse bias. Nonsampling errors are treated in several sections of this appendix.
The main section pertains to the imputation procedures used for item nonresponses, and the
special treatment given to the fuel efficiency, reported in miles per gallon (MPG), of
pre-1975 vehicles. </p>


<p>Sampling error is a measure of the variability in the data because a sample of
households was surveyed rather than the entire population. The different samples that
could be selected would each produce different values for the survey statistics. Because
the survey used probability sampling techniques, it is possible to estimate the size of
the sampling error for any statistic. These estimates can be used as a guide in making
inferences from the sample estimates to the total population. The final section on
sampling error pertains to estimating the magnitude of the error and the presentation of
sampling errors as row and column factors in the detailed tables of this report. </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>Noncovered Residential Vehicles</b></font></strong>
</p>


<p>The RTECS is a subsample of the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS).
Therefore, any type of household not covered in the RECS would affect the type of
household vehicles not covered in the RTECS. The following types of individuals or
families were not covered by RECS and, hence, the vehicles corresponding to these
households were not covered by RTECS. </p>


<p>Families or individuals living in group quarters such as college dormitories, military
barracks, or large boarding houses (10 or more unrelated adults). </p>


<p>Families or individuals living in recreation vehicles or other vehicles. </p>


<p>Families or individuals with no fixed address. </p>


<p>The effect of these omissions is an underestimation of the total number of vehicles in
the residential sector and an underestimation in the number of miles driven, gallons
consumed, and dollars spent. </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>July 1994 as a Reference for
Number of Households</b></font></strong> </p>


<p>The design of RTECS calls for households to be followed for the 1994 calendar year.
Consequently, households formed during 1994 are represented in the sample by households
that existed at the time the 1993 RECS was fielded. Hence, RTECS may have an
over-representation of established households at the expense of newly formed households. </p>


<p>The decision to follow households for the entire year and not add a sample of
households formed during 1994 means that as the survey progressed through 1994, the
estimate of the number of vehicles accumulated a negative bias. This happens for several
reasons. </p>


<p>When established households separate, only part of the household is followed by RTECS.
If the part of the household that is not followed takes a vehicle with them, that vehicle
is counted as a disposed vehicle. </p>


<p>Any vehicle acquired by a household member that leaves the household is not included in
the RTECS. </p>



<p>The number of households for the 1994 RTECS is set equal to the Current Population
Survey (CPS) estimate of the number of households as of July 1994. (See the section below
on poststratification.) RTECS does not provide for an increasing number of households from
January to December. The household number for July is the number used for the entire year.
This has the effect of overestimating the number of households and vehicles for January
1994 and underestimating the number for December 1994. </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>Nonsampling Error</b></font></strong>
</p>


<p>Nonsampling errors are due to the conduct of the survey, and include both random errors
and systematic errors or biases. The magnitudes of nonsampling biases cannot be estimated
from the sample data. Thus, avoidance of systematic biases is a primary objective of all
stages of survey design. (See Appendix A, &quot;How the Survey was Conducted,&quot; for a
discussion of procedures implemented to minimize all types of nonsampling errors.)
Subsequent to conducting a survey, problems of unit nonresponse and item nonresponse need
to be addressed. The treatment in the RTECS of these types of errors are discussed in
separate sections below. </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>Unit Nonresponse</b></font></strong>
</p>


<p>Unit nonresponse is the type of nonresponse that occurs when no data are available for
an entire sampled household. Most unit nonresponse cases are caused by the respondent
being unavailable or the respondent's refusal to cooperate. </p>


<p>Unit nonresponse for the 1994 RTECS must be addressed in the context of the unit
nonresponse for the 1993 RECS, since the 1994 RTECS sample was drawn from households that
responded to the 1993 RECS. Thus, in all cases, at least the RECS data were available for
every RTECS household, therefore, no RTECS household was a total nonrespondent. Generally,
weight adjustment was the method used to reduce unit nonresponse bias in the RECS
statistics and that adjustment carried over automatically to the RTECS subsample. (See <em>Housing
Characteristics 1993</em> (published May 1992), DOE/EIA-0314(90) Appendix A, for a
discussion of unit nonresponse adjustment.) </p>



<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>Imputation Procedures for Item
Nonresponse</b></font></strong> </p>


<p>Item nonresponse occurs when the respondents do not know the answer or refuse to answer
a question, or when an interviewer does not ask a question or does not record an answer.
To facilitate &quot;full-sample&quot; data analyses, imputations were made to provide the
most probable responses when responses were missing. The following imputation techniques
were used: hot-decking, predictive mean matching, and regression. </p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial">Hot-Deck Procedure</font></strong> </p>


<p>The most commonly used technique of imputation for the RTECS was the hot-deck
procedure. In hot-decking, when a certain response is missing for a given household or
vehicle, another household or vehicle called a donor is randomly chosen to furnish its
reported value for that missing item. The value is then assigned to the nonrespondent
household or vehicle. To serve as a potential donor, a household or vehicle had to be
similar to the nonrespondent in characteristics correlated with the missing item. </p>


<p>The RTECS items that were imputed using the hot-deck procedure were pre-1975 vehicle
characteristics and fuel grade. Household demographic items such as family income and
ethnic background were hot-decked as part of the RECS. (See <em>Housing Characteristics
1993</em> (published June 1995), DOE/EIA-0314(93), Appendix C, for a discussion of
imputation of household characteristics.) </p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial"><b>Mid-Year Stock Dispositions and Acquisitions</b></font></strong>
</p>


<p>Changes to the vehicle stock were defined as acquisitions, dispositions, or a
combination of both. In an ideal RTECS, a beginning vehicle stock inventory reported in
the 1993 RECS interview would be followed throughout the 1994 RTECS calendar year and, at
the time of each RTECS contact, changes in vehicle stock would be reported. However,
because in some cases it was impossible to follow a household for the entire RTECS year
due to attrition, it was unknown if, for these households, vehicle stock changes were
made. </p>


<p>In the 1991 Procedures were developed to impute changes in vehicle stock for households
that were not followed for the entire year. This procedure was eliminated from the 1994. </p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial">R<b>egression Procedures</b></font></strong> </p>


<p>Multiple regressions were used to impute for annual VMT for vehicles imputed as
acquired, since two odometer readings were not available in these cases. Simple linear and
multiple regressions were also used to impute annual mileage for other vehicles when two
odometer readings were not obtained. (See Appendix B, &quot;Estimation
Methodologies,&quot; for details on the imputation of VMT). </p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial">Imputation of Vehicle Characteristics for 1975 and Later</font></strong>
</p>


<p>Vehicle characteristics that were missing for vehicle model years 1975 and later were
imputed using either the VIN or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certification
files (CERT files) containing laboratory test results of MPG. When the vehicle
characteristic was missing from the questionnaire, but the VIN was available, the
characteristics from the VIN were used. Additionally, when there was a discrepancy between
the VIN and the RTECS respondent's answer, the VIN generally overrode the response
provided by the respondent. If both the VIN and questionnaire responses were missing, the
vehicle characteristics were imputed from the CERT files. An individual record from the
CERT files was chosen as a donor for a recipient sample vehicle by first narrowing the
choice by using the known vehicle characteristics of the recipient vehicle, and then
second, selecting a single CERT record according to probabilities proportional to vehicle
sales. The type of fuel (gasoline or diesel) used in the vehicle was also imputed using
the EPA CERT files (See Appendix B, &quot;Estimation Methodologies,&quot; for more details
on the use of EPA CERT files in the 1994 RTECS.) </p>


<p><b><strong><font FACE="Arial">Imputation of Vehicle Characteristics and MPG for
Pre-1975 Vehicle M</font>odel Years</strong></b> </p>


<p>For all RTECS sample vehicles, the questionnaires and VIN's jointly provided the
following vehicle characteristics: make, model, model year, number of cylinders, engine
displacement (liters or cubic inches), transmission type (automatic or manual), and fuel
system type (carbureted, gasoline fuel injected, or diesel). Many of these characteristics
were used to assign EPA test MPG to the sample vehicles. EPA records, in the form of CERT
files, were used to provide these MPG, as well as to provide any vehicle characteristics
that were not obtained from the questionnaire or VIN (See Appendix B, &quot;Estimation
Methodologies,&quot; for more details.) </p>


<p>The EPA CERT files, however, have only been available since 1975. The 1994 RTECS file
contained 556 pre-1975 vehicles (9 percent), and for these vehicles, missing
characteristics were imputed by a hot-deck procedure using 1994 respondents as donor
vehicles. Each donor and recipient vehicle was paired on as many of the following
characteristics as possible: make, model, model year, transmission type, number of
cylinders, and engine displacement. </p>


<p>The MPG for pre-1975 vehicles were imputed using a cold-deck procedure. The donor
vehicles were respondents from the 1985 RTECS. Fuel purchase diaries were used in the 1985
RTECS; therefore, no shortfall adjustments were needed for the MPG. Cold-decking was
performed within categories defined by make, model, model year, transmission type, and
number of cylinders, with collapsing of categories performed where necessary. For example,
MPG could be selected from donor vehicles of a certain size class in either the Pontiacs
or the Chevrolets, if they shared similar model years, transmission type, and the General
Motors 350 cubic inch V-8 engine. However, it appeared that a greater share of the
variability in the 1985 RTECS MPG was due to individual driving habits, automotive
maintenance and diary keeping, rather than to vehicle characteristics. </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>Quality of Specific Data Items</b></font></strong>
</p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial"><b>Vehicle Identification Number</b></font></strong> </p>


<p>The VIN is a unique combination of numbers and letters that when decoded provide the
characteristics of a particular vehicle. Since 1954, the VIN has been used by American
automobile manufacturers. Beginning with the 1981 model year, a standard 17-character VIN
was assigned to all vehicles sold in the United States. VIN's were obtained for most of
the vehicles in the 1994 RTECS. The vehicle characteristics from decoded VIN's were
employed in the 1994 RTECS to enhance the accuracy of reported vehicle characteristics.
These characteristics were used in determining vehicle fuel efficiency based on the EPA
certification files of test laboratory MPG estimates (See Appendix A, &quot;How the Survey
Was Conducted,&quot; for a discussion of the VIN.) </p>


<p>There were three occasions where attempts were made to obtain the VIN's: the RECS
interview, the Beginning-of-Year(B-O-Y) interview, and the End-of-Year (E-O-Y) interview. </p>


<p>A computer software program, VINDICATOR, from the Highway Loss Data Institute, was used
to decode the VIN's. For VIN's that could not be decoded immediately using this program, a
computer routine was developed to correct for common errors in the transcription of VIN's.
The vehicle characteristics produced for these &quot;fixed&quot; VIN's were then carefully
compared to respondent information. Approximately 200 VIN's were salvaged using this
routine. </p>


<p>Overall, the collection of the VIN was a highly successful endeavor that yielded
quality data. VIN's were obtained for 4,617 (76 percent) of the 6,084 total sample
vehicles. Of the 4,617 obtained VIN's, 3,842 ( 83 percent) were considered
&quot;good&quot; VIN's. In summary, &quot;good&quot; VIN's were obtained for 3,842 (63
percent) of the 6,084 sampled vehicles. (A good VIN was one that did not require
correcting for common transcription error before it could be decoded.) </p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial"><b>Vehicle Fuel Price and Expenditures</b></font></strong> </p>


<p><strong>Vehicle Fuel Price:</strong> In the 1988 through the 1994 RTECS, fuel price
data were not collected via fuel purchase diaries, as had previous RTECS. Instead, fuel
prices were determined from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Retail Pump Average Gasoline
Prices and the Lundberg Survey, Inc., prices. (See Appendix B, &quot;Estimation
Methodologies&quot; for a discussion of the sources of vehicle fuel prices and the
assignment of specific prices to the RTECS data.) </p>


<p>To validate the new RTECS price methodology, the 1985 RTECS gasoline prices were
recalculated and analyzed using the new methodology (BLS price data). Results of this
analysis suggest that if the 1985 BLS price data had been used in 1985 instead of fuel
purchase diary data, the average vehicle fuel price reported for the 1985 RTECS would have
increased by approximately 2 cents per gallon. </p>


<p>For this analysis, only the prices for unleaded regular gasoline, unleaded premium
gasoline, and leaded regular gasoline were recalculated. The prices for leaded premium,
diesel, and other fuels were left equal to the prices used in the 1985 RTECS. </p>


<p>The BLS prices that were used for recalculating the 1985 RTECS prices were monthly 1985
regional retail gasoline prices for leaded regular, unleaded regular, and unleaded
premium. The prices were averaged across months for each of the above fuel types within
each of the four Census regions. One of these average prices was assigned to each of the
RTECS vehicles depending on Census region and on vehicle fuel type used. </p>


<p>Table C1 presents the BLS prices (monthly prices were for 1985) with the corresponding
average prices from the 1985 RTECS. Overall, the BLS prices compared well with the
corresponding average regional fuel prices from RTECS. The largest difference corresponded
to unleaded premium gasoline. </p>


<p>While there was general consistency between the BLS prices and the 1985 RTECS prices,
the differences that did exist may have stemmed from the differences in the two survey
populations and survey collection procedures. </p>


<p>The BLS population (approximately 85 percent of the total U.S. population) consisted of
the U.S. urban, noninstitutional population excluding households living on military bases.
The RTECS population represented both urban and rural areas and included military bases. </p>


<p>BLS prices were based on prices gathered from service stations and sales volume. The
1985 RTECS prices were produced from fuel quantities and expenditures for individual
vehicle refuelings. </p>


<p>The BLS sample was a rotating sample of service stations. Every year approximately
one-fifth of the service stations in the sample were replaced with service stations that
consumers reported using in that year's &quot;Point of Purchase Survey&quot; conducted by
the BLS. Thus, the BLS prices included service stations where consumers currently
purchased fuel as well as stations where they had previously purchased fuel. The RTECS
prices were based entirely on the service stations where consumers were currently
purchasing their vehicle fuel. </p>

<p><sup>a</sup>BLS average prices in this table were derived by assigning BLS prices to
the 1985 RTECS sample vehicles, then producing </p>


<p>national averages using the 1985 RTECS sample weights. </p>


<p><sup>b</sup>Prices for these fuels were not collected by BLS; therefore, the 1985 RTECS
prices were used. </p>


<p><strong>Vehicle Fuel Expenditures:</strong> Vehicle fuel expenditures were calculated
by multiplying the price paid for fuel by the quantity of fuel used. Expenditures per
household were the sum of the expenditures for each vehicle in the household. To assess
the effect of the 1988 RTECS price methodology on vehicle fuel expenditures, the 1985
household vehicle fuel expenditures were recalculated using the 1985 BLS price data. Table
C2 compares average expenditures by fuel type and Census region using both sources of
price data. </p>


<p>The use of BLS prices for the 1985 RTECS would have increased the per household
expenditures for vehicle fuel from $1,274 per year to $1,292 per year. The changes in
expenditures reflect differences in the average price of gasoline between the new 1988
methodology and the 1985 RTECS methodology since the average consumption used to calculate
the expenditures comes from the RTECS data under the new and original methodologies. The
estimated total 1985 U.S. expenditures for vehicle fuel increased from 99.1 billion
dollars to 100.4 billion dollars when the 1988 methodology was applied to the 1985 RTECS
data. </p>


<p>The 1988 RTECS price methodology seemed to have little effect on the standard errors of
expenditure statistics. When the 1985 RTECS prices were recalculated using 1985 BLS price
data, the standard errors of the expenditures were close to the standard errors reported
using the 1985 RTECS fuel purchase diary data. While the standard errors of the fuel
prices were reduced, in some cases by 50 percent, the variability in fuel prices was very
small relative to the variability in gallons of fuel consumed. Therefore, the standard
errors of the vehicle fuel expenditures were largely controlled by the variability in
gallons of fuel consumed. </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b>Sampling Error </b></font></strong></p>


<p>The random differences between the survey estimates and the true population value that
occur because of the particular sample that was selected are known as sampling errors. The
average sampling error, averaged over all possible samples, should be zero. Although the
sampling error is nonzero and unknown for the particular sample chosen, the sample design
permits sampling errors to be estimated. The typical magnitude of the sampling error is
measured by the &quot;standard error&quot; of the estimate. Standard errors in this report
are given as percents of their estimated values, that is, as relative standard errors
(RSE). The RSE is also known as the coefficient of variation. </p>

<p>The following sections provide a discussion of the procedure used to estimate sampling
variances as well as an explanation and example of the procedures used to calculate
approximate RSE's for each statistic shown in Tables 6 through 23 in the &quot;Detailed
Tables&quot; section of this publication. </p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial">Balanced Half-Sample Replication</font></strong> </p>


<p>For some surveys, a convenient algebraic formula for computing variances can be
obtained. However, the RECS (of which the RTECS is a subsample) used a multistage area
sample design of such complexity that it is virtually impossible to construct an exact
algebraic expression for estimating variances (See <em>Housing Characteristics 1993</em>
(published May 1992), DOE/EIA-0314(90) Appendix A). Instead, the method used to estimate
sampling variances for this survey was balanced half-sample replication. This numerical
method involves pairing primary sampling units (PSU) in the strata so that differences
between the members of each pair can be used to build an estimate of sampling variance.
The strata were collapsed to 85 new strata to achieve this pairing of PSU's. Of these 85
strata, 44 each contained two nonself-representing PSU's belonging to the same Census
division, with one PSU constituting each member of a pair. Of the remaining 41 strata, 32

were each composed of one self-representing PSU; that is, they consisted of large
metropolitan areas that came into the sample with certainty. In each of the latter strata,
all of the PSU's were treated as a composite PSU, while the segments within the composite
PSU were segregated into two groups representing the two members of a pair. There was no
between-PSU component of variance for self-representing PSU's. The nine remaining strata
contained nonself-representing PSU's that were treated as if they were self-representing
PSU's. These nine strata were in separate Census divisions, and were not collapsed to form
pairs of nonself-representing PSU's due to a desire to restrict pairing to within the nine
Census divisions, and also due to the desire to treat Alaska and Hawaii as two separate
and unique strata. </p>


<p>&nbsp; </p>


<p>Balanced half-sample replication involved repeatedly drawing pair members from the 85
strata. Each replication is called a &quot;half-sample&quot; because only one member of
the pair within each of the 85 strata was selected. The poststratification procedure
described in Appendix A, &quot;How the Survey Was Conducted,&quot; was performed
independently for each half-sample, so that the resulting variance estimates would reflect
the benefits of poststratification. The sample units drawn into each half-sample and
adjusted by poststratification can produce unbiased survey statistics based on roughly
one-half of the data. Using different combinations of members from the 85 pairs, it is
possible to produce a total of 2<sup>85</sup> = 3.9 X 10<sup>25</sup> unique half-samples.
</p>


<p>Although desirable for good variance estimation, a large number of half-samples would
be computationally infeasible. However, the method of balanced half-sample replication
allows a small number of half-samples (approximately equal to the number of strata) to
produce estimates of variance that are identical to estimates based on all possible unique
half-samples for linear survey statistics. The use of ratio adjustments such as
poststratification means that even a statistic giving the number of households in a
category is not a linear statistic. For nonlinear survey statistics, the variance estimate
computed using the method of balanced half-samples is approximately equal to the variance
estimate computed using all possible half-samples. With this balancing method each
half-sample is constructed by using an orthogonal matrix to control the selection of pair
members from strata. For the RTECS, 128 balanced half-samples were used in variance
estimation. </p>


<p>The variances are estimated from the 128 half-sample-based statistics in the following
way. Let Y' be a survey estimate of characteristic Y for a certain category of housing
units (for example, total consumption of vehicle fuel in the West Census Region). Then,
the estimated variance of Y' is given by: </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><img SRC="appenc2.htg/img2.gif" WIDTH="647" HEIGHT="59" ALIGN="bottom"></p>

standard error of Y' is given by: </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Row and Column Factors</font></strong>
</p>


<p>RSE's were calculated for all statistics in this publication, although they cannot be
presented due to space limitations. However, the RSE's are presented in a generalized
form. The method of presenting generalized RSE's of statistics uses sets of row and column
factors inserted in the top row and right-most column of figures in each table. This
method of presentation allows the readers to calculate an approximate RSE for each
statistic. To estimate the RSE of a statistic in the i<sup>th</sup> row and j<sup>th</sup>
column of a particular table, the approximation RSEA<sub>i,j</sub> for the original RSE<sub>i,j</sub>
is given by: </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><img SRC="appenc2.htg/img4.gif" WIDTH="647" HEIGHT="59" ALIGN="bottom"></p>


<p ALIGN="left">Where: R<sub>i</sub> is the RSE row factor given at the right-most margin
of row i in the tables, and C<sub>j</sub> is the RSE column factor given at the top of
column j. </p>


<p>The following example illustrates this procedure: </p>


<p>Referencing the second row of the table (Figure C1) labeled &quot;Northeast,&quot; and
the third column labeled &quot;Vehicle-Miles Traveled (billion),&quot; yields an estimate
of 295 billion miles driven. The RSE row factor is R<sub>2</sub> = 4.4, and the RSE column
factor is C<sub>3</sub> = 1.1. The approximate RSE for the estimate is, therefore, </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><img SRC="appenc2.htg/img5.gif" WIDTH="647" HEIGHT="59" ALIGN="bottom"></p>


<p ALIGN="left">The standard error derived from row and column factors can be used to
construct confidence intervals as in Figure C1, and to perform hypothesis tests by
standard statistical methods. However, because the generalized variance procedure gives

only approximate RSE's, such confidence intervals and statistical tests must also be
regarded as only approximate. </p>


<p>&nbsp; </p>


<p>For the example above, the RSE determined directly by the half-sample method is
actually 5.20 percent, not 4.84 percent. </p>

row i. The RSE column factor, C<sub>j</sub>, is an adjustment factor with geometric mean
equal to 1.0.<a HREF="appenc2.html#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p>


<p>Statistics in the tables in the &quot;Detailed Tables&quot; section are suppressed by
the footnote symbol &quot;Q&quot; if (1) the RSE exceeds 50 percent, or (2) for tables
showing household counts, fewer than 10 sample households were used to compute the
statistics, or (3) for tables showing vehicle counts, fewer than 18 sample vehicles were
used to compute the statistics. The estimation procedure used to obtain the row and column
factors does not use RSE's for statistics that were suppressed by the footnote
&quot;Q&quot; or for statistics with RSE's that are less than 1.0 percent. In addition, if
the statistic for a cell is not listed for any other reason, the RSE for that cell is not
used in the procedure. This convention is used because the product of the row and column
factors frequently is an inaccurate estimate for these RSE's. </p>


<p>Using these cells in the calculation of the row and column factors may result in
factors that give inaccurate RSE estimates for other cells actually presented in the
table. </p>


<p>Whenever a household count is a poststratification control total, its RSE estimate is
zero. An example is the cell in the first row and first column of Table 25. This cell
contains an estimate of the national total of households as of July 1994 (that is,
households with and without vehicles). Because the RSE is zero, this cell was not used in
the computation of row and column factors. Zero RSE's are never used in row and column
calculations, because their inclusion would make the row and column factors
inappropriately low for the bulk of the statistics in the tables. Therefore, RSE's
calculated from row and column factors for the total household count in Table 25 or for
any other poststratification control total, will be inappropriately overestimated. </p>


<p><strong><font FACE="Arial">Determination of the Standard Error of the Difference
Between Two Statistics</font></strong> </p>


<p>The procedure used to compute the standard error of the difference between two
statistics follows: </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><img SRC="appenc2.htg/img11.gif" WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="bottom"></p>


<p ALIGN="left">This procedure assumes the two statistics are not correlated. The
following example illustrates this procedure. Households with children drove an average of
22,800 miles per household in 1994. Households without children drove an average of 16,500
miles, for a difference of 6,300 miles. The RSE's for households with and without children
are 2.9 and 2.3, respectively. The corresponding standard errors are 661 miles and 380
miles, respectively. Therefore, the standard error for the difference is: </p>


<p ALIGN="center"><img SRC="appenc2.htg/img12.gif" WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="bottom"></p>


<p ALIGN="left">If 1.96 times the standard error is greater than the difference between
the statistics, the difference is not statistically significant at the .05 level of
significance (the level used to test significance of inferences in this report). In this
example, 1.96 times the standard error equals 1,494 miles, while the difference is 6,300
miles. Therefore, the conclusion is that, in 1994, there was a significant difference in
average mileage driven per household, between households with and without children. </p>
