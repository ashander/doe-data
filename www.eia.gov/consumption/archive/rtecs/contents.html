            <p>EIA conducts numerous energy-related surveys and other 
            information programs. In general, the surveys can be divided into 
            two broad groups: supply surveys, directed to the suppliers and 
            marketers of specific energy sources, that measure the quantities of 
            specific fuels produced for and/or supplied to the market; and 
            consumption surveys, which gather information on the types of energy 
            used by consumer groups along with the consumer characteristics that 
            are associated with energy use. 
            <p>In the transportation sector, EIA’s core consumption survey was 
            the Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey. RTECS 
            belongs to the consumption group because it collects information 
            directly from the consumer, the household. For roughly a decade, EIA 
            fielded the RTECS--data were first collected in 1983. This 
            survey, fielded for the last time in 1994, was a triennial survey of 
            energy use and expenditures, vehicle miles-traveled (VMT), and 
            vehicle characteristics for household vehicles. For the 1994 survey, 
            a national sample of more than 3,000 households that own or use some 
            5,500 vehicles provided data. </p>
            <p>With the discontinuation of the RTECS after 1994, EIA no longer 
            had a survey of energy consumption for any part of the 
            transportation sector. To fill the gap in household vehicle energy 
            data, EIA partnered with the U.S. Department of Transportation to 
            fill this gap in energy-related transportation statistics, using the 
            latest National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), conducted in 
            2001/2002. The National Household Travel Survey [formerly known as 
            the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) and the 
            American Travel Survey (ATS)] are household-based travel surveys 
            conducted every five years by the U.S. Department of Transportation 
            (US DOT). Survey data are collected from a sample of U.S. households 
            and expanded to provide national estimates of trips and miles by 
            travel mode, purpose, and a host of other characteristics. The 
            survey collects information on daily, local trips and on 
            long-distance travel in the United States. Because the survey 
            included direct collection of odometer-based vehicle miles traveled, 
            EIA was able to derive energy consumption and expenditures 
            information for the vehicles in the sample households. In that way, 
            EIA was able to create a data set essentially comparable to the data 
            available from RTECS. </p>
            <p>EIA has also been involved with other consumer-based data 
            initiatives for transportation. During the first half of the 1990’s, 
            in response to requirements in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to 
            investigate the potential markets for alternative-fuel vehicles, EIA 
            conducted surveys of electric utility, natural gas supplier, and 
            propane provider vehicle fleets; surveys of commercial fleets in the 
            cities of Atlanta and Denver; a survey of private consumer 
            preferences for alternative-fuel vehicles, and an internal 
            assessment of the composition of the nonresidential highway vehicle 
            fleet. In addition, EIA has developed a calculator of regional 
            driving costs based on up-to-date fuel prices and user-supplied 
            vehicle miles per gallon and miles traveled. </p>
            <p>EIA is currently investigating the possibility of producing 
            commercial highway vehicle energy consumption and expenditures 
            estimates based on the 2002 Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey, 
            sponsored by the Department of Transportation and conducted by the 
            Census Bureau. </p>
