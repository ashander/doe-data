<a name="SURVEY BACKGROUND"><strong>SURVEY BACKGROUND</strong></a> </p>

<p>This is the third time that data collected on the Residential Transportation Energy
Consumption Survey are available on either microcomputer readable diskettes or on the
Internet. At this time, only the 1988, 1991, and 1994 RTECS data are available on
diskettes. The 1991 and 1994 are available on the Internet. Prior to 1988, the public use
data were available on magnetic tapes only. </p>

<p>The public use files contain data based on household telephone interviews from the 1994
Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey (RTECS). The survey was taken from a
subsample of respondents to the 1993 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). </p>

<p>During the 1993 RECS personal interview, selected vehicle characteristics were obtained
for up to eight vehicles. Further information about these vehicles, and data relating to
additional vehicles in the household were then obtained during the 1994 RTECS telephone
interviews. </p>

<p>This is the second time that all RECS data have been made available for all RTECS
sampled households. </p><strong>

<p>NOTE: When tabulating RECS household variables using the RTECS public use files,
differences from the published RECS tabulations will occur because the RTECS households
are a subsample of the RECS households. Anyone whose primary interest is the RECS
household data, should use the 1993 RECS Public Use Data.</p></strong> 

<p>The RTECS was designed by the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration
(EIA) to provide information on the use of energy by residential vehicles in the United
States and the District of Columbia. Included are data about: the number and type of
vehicles in the residential sector, the characteristics of those vehicles, the total
annual Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), the per household and per vehicle VMT, the vehicle
fuel consumption and expenditures, and vehicle fuel efficiencies. </p>

<p>Vehicle characteristic information for each vehicle was collected directly from the
respondent and also from the decoded Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Vehicle fuel
efficiencies, provided in miles per gallon (MPG), and vehicle fuel consumption and
expenditures were estimated using outside data sources, as they were in 1988 and 1991, in
contrast to previous RTECS, where such information could be derived from fuel purchase
information collected for sample vehicles. </p>

<p>The 1994 RTECS was the fifth RTECS covering a calendar year. Previous RTECS were
conducted monthly from June 1979 to September 1981 and annual data were collected in 1983,
1985, 1988, 1991 and 1994. At this time, only the 1988, 1991, and 1994 RTECS data and the
1987 and 1990, and 1993 RECS data are available on diskettes. The 1987, 1990, and 1993
RECS and the 1991 and 1994 RTECS are available via the Internet at
ftp://ftp.eia.doe.gov/pub/consumption/. </p>

<p>The documentation refers to the public use files as &quot;on diskette number 1&quot;
etc. This documentation is to be used with both versions of the micro-data: diskettes and
Internet. </p>

<p>Included on the RTECS public use files are: the number and type of household vehicles,
characteristics of those vehicles such as engine size and transmission type, the per
household and per vehicle VMT, motor vehicle fuel consumption and expenditures, and
vehicle fuel efficiencies. Household characteristics and energy consumption and
expenditure data items from the 1993 RECS have been merged with the 1994 RTECS
vehicle-related data. Consequently, for households that participated in both the 1993 RECS
and the 1994 RTECS, data are available on energy used within the home as well as energy
used in personal vehicles. Note, however, when combining these data, the time periods of
consumption are different. Household energy consumption is for calendar 1993 and the
transportation energy data are for 1994. In comparing tabulations of similar data items
from the RECS and RTECS survey data files, keep in mind that small differences may also
occur because the RTECS households are a subsample of the RECS households. </p>

<p>The 1994 public use data excludes Alaska and Hawaii; therefore, <strong>RTECS data from
the public use file will not agree with published data</strong> from the companion report
listed below. Alaska and Hawaii were included in the 1991 public use data. </p>

<p>Published data for the 1994 RTECS primarily contain households possessing vehicles at
any time during the year. Selecting on the variable VSMAX not = 0 will yield data for
households with vehicles.<br>

<p>Results of the RTECS will be reported by the Office of Energy Markets and End Use in a
publication titled: <em>Household Vehicles Energy Consumption 1994</em>, July 1997. </p>

<p>Note: The title for this report was shortened in 1988. Previous survey editions
included the name of the survey in the title, e.g., <em>Residential Transportation Energy
Consumption Survey: Consumption Patterns of Household Vehicles (data year).</em> </p>

<p><em>Household Vehicles Energy Consumption 1994</em> should be obtained by persons using
the public use data . In addition to providing summary statistics of the data, the report
provides detailed information concerning the survey sample, the survey procedures, the
survey forms, the treatment of missing data, the procedures used to estimate fuel
consumption and expenditures, and the estimation of sampling error. Also included are
detailed discussions of specific data items. Special topics include: Vehicle Miles
Traveled, Trends in Household Vehicle Stock, and Vehicle Fuel Efficiency.<br>

<a name="DECOMPRESSING THE DATA FILES"><strong>Decompressing the Data Files</strong></a> </p>

<p>The public use files contain the 1994 RTECS basic data concerning personal vehicles as
well as data from the corresponding 1993 RECS households. The RTECS sample consisted of
3,020 housing units selected from the 7,000 available 1993 RECS housing units for which
data were successfully collected. The 1993 RECS represented households in the 50 States
and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p>Because data for Alaska and Hawaii were removed from the public use files in order to
protect the identity of the survey respondents, each of the 38 files contains 3,002
records. These households are weighted to represent 96.8 million households (84.4 million
have vehicles), as of July 1994, the midpoint of data collection activity. The 1994 RTECS
found nearly 157 million vehicles in use in the residential households in the United
States. </p>

<p>The smallest unit of sampling and estimation is the housing unit. Vehicles can be used
as a unit of analysis because data have been collected for all vehicles in sampled
households, thus providing housing-unit-based national representation of the residential
vehicle stock. The finest geographic identification available are the nine Census
divisions. These households are weighted to represent 97.3 million households (96.8 with
Alaska and Hawaii removed) as of July 1994. There are 84.9 million households (84.4 with
Alaska and Hawaii removed) with residential vehicles. The 1994 RTECS found nearly 157
million vehicles in use in the residential households in the United States. </p>

<p>Each public use record contains between 56 and 226 characters (bytes) in length and is
uniquely identified by Household ID (HHID), Weight (WEIGHTJ), Region (REGIONC) and
Division (DIVISION). For total number of households, &quot;WEIGHTJ&quot; or &quot;WEIGHTJ
* VARIABLE&quot; should be summed for a particular occurrence. For households that have
vehicles, also use the filter &quot;when VSMAX not = '00'&quot;. </p>

<p>When using relational databases, HHID is the variable upon which to index and relate. </p>

<p>Fields are 9-filled when not applicable; e.g., for households with one vehicle, the
fields for the remaining 7 vehicles are 9-filled. They are not left blank. </p>

<p>RTECS data from these Public Use Files will not agree with RTECS published data from
the companion report, <em>Households Vehicles Energy Consumption 1994</em>. Alaska and
Hawaii were removed in order to maintain the survey respondents' confidentiality. </p>

<p>Additional information to further understand and fully utilize the public use diskette
data, can be found in the appendices of <em>Households Vehicles Energy Consumption 1994</em>.<br>
</p>

<p>Two versions of the RTECS public use diskettes are available:<br>
ASCII files delimited with blanks and dBase III files. All files are self-expanding files
and were compressed using PKZIP. After downloading either the ASCII or dBase set, place
the downloaded file in a separate directory and expand it using pkunzip. </p>

<p>If you don't have pkunzip.exe, you can download it <a
href="ftp://ftp.eia.doe.gov/pub/consumption/transportation/pkz204g.exe">here</a>.
PKUNZIP.EXE is in PKZ204g.exe. PKUNZIP.EXE is the only file you need, but the developers
of the product have asked that the entire package be distributed and not the individual
files. You can however find pkunzip.exe on several other Internet sites. Download
PKZ204g.exe to a separate directory, type PKZ204g at the DOS prompt and press ENTER or
double-click the file PKZ204g.EXE. Several files will be created.<br>
</p>

<p>Copy PKUNZIP.EXE to the directory where your RTECS public use file resides.<br>

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Please read the documentation first. You may not need all of
the files expanded. </p>

<p>Proceed to expand the remaining three self-expanding files by typing ASCII1, ASCII2,
etc. at the DOS prompt or by double-clicking each .EXE file. Two readme text files and
several .EXE files will be created. Read the two readme files, read1st.txt and readme.txt.
Readme.txt contains all necessary documentation to use the public use data files. NOTE:
The documentation refers to the data as though it were on floppy diskettes. Documentation
for the 1994 RTECS Public Use Data can be found on-line at
http://www.eia.gov/emeu/rtecs/userguid.html.<br>
</p>

<p>All documentation other than this User's Guide (README.txt), is compressed. Exhibit 3
shows the number of fields and bytes per file. The files contain the following: </p>

<p>READ1st.txt - Instructions on how to print this user's guide<br>
README.txt - This user's guide<br>
APPEND?.EXE - Copies of the User Guide Appendices, where ? is the appendix letter A
through K<br>
.EXE data files - They will expand as either .ASC or .DBF. Exhibit 1, below, contains the
38 logical file names and contents. See Exhibit 2 for a listing of filenames.<br>
<img src="swashb.gif" alt="divider line"><br>
This User's Guide, along with the self-expanding appendices, contains all necessary
documentation to use the public use data files. </p>

<p>The documentation and data files are self-expanding files. By typing the file name
(example: APPLIANC) at the DOS prompt from the directory where the file is located or by
double clicking on the file name (applianc.exe) from Program Manager, Explore or My
Computer, the applianc file will expand and you will have created either applianc.asc or
applianc.dbf depending on whether you are working with the ASCII or dBase files. </p>

<p>Check the number of bytes against those in Exhibit 3, &quot;Number of Fields and Bytes
per File&quot; and if they agree you may delete the associated .EXE file (applianc.exe). <br>

<strong><a name="CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS">Changes from Previous Versions of RTECS
Public Use Data</a></strong> </p>

<p>Users of previous RTECS public use magnetic tapes should be aware of the following
changes included in the 1988, 1991, and 1994 RTECS public use data. </p>

<p>The 1988 RTECS marked a major change in the survey design and the data collection
procedures made, in large part, due to budget constraints. The major change focused on the
way the fuel efficiencies were estimated. Prior to 1988, RTECS collected data used in
calculating fuel efficiencies through monthly fuel purchase diaries maintained by
respondents. In 1988, 1991 and 1994, MPG and fuel price data were estimated by different
means than were used in 1985. In 1988, 1991 and 1994, MPG were estimated using adjusted
test laboratory MPG as recorded on the EPA Emissions Certification files. Fuel price data
were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) gasoline pump price series and the
Lundberg Survey, Inc., price series. (See Appendix B of the Internet report,
&quot;Estimation Methodologies&quot; for a detailed discussion of the estimation
procedures used.) </p>

<p>It is not anticipated that the change in methodology will result in increased error;
although the errors will come from different sources than in previous RTECS. However, any
comparison of vehicle fuel efficiency or consumption and expenditures with RTECS prior to
1988 should still be viewed with caution. </p>

<p>Other significant changes in the 1994 RTECS design and data collection included the
following: 

<ul>
  <li>The sample size of 3,020 for the 1994 RTECS was similar to the 1991 and 1988 RTECS
    (1991: 3,045 households, and 1988: 2,986 households). </li>
  <li>The number of contacts with respondents required to collect the data for the end of year
    data collection in 1994 was 6 per household, compared with 10 contacts in the 1991 RTECS.</li>
  <li>In 1988, &quot;02&quot; was a valid &quot;TYPE&quot; code for a &quot;two-seater
    vehicle&quot; and was reported as a separate category from &quot;Sedan&quot;. In 1991 and
    1994, &quot;02&quot; was dropped and the &quot;two-seater vehicle&quot; was included with
    &quot;Sedan&quot;.</li>
  <li>In 1991 and 1994, the separate fuel type category &quot;Gasohol&quot; (or Ethanol Blend)
    was added. In 1988, there were only &quot;Gasoline&quot;, &quot;Diesel&quot;, and
    &quot;Other&quot;.</li>
  <li>In 1988, &quot;Engine Size&quot; was collected in liters or cubic inches and was
    reported in liters in the report. The 1988 public use data also had both liters and cubic
    inches. In 1991 and 1994, even though &quot;Engine Size&quot; was collected in liters or
    cubic inches, only cubic inches were put on the data file. The published report still
    showed &quot;Engine Size&quot; in liters. The cubic inches were converted to liters in the
    TPL programming by multiplying cubic inches by .016387. </li>
  <li>For the first time in 1988, respondents were asked to provide the Vehicle Identification
    Number (VIN) for each vehicle. This was continued in 1991 and 1994. The decoded VIN was
    used to enhance the accuracy of reported vehicle characteristics. These characteristics
    were used to match sampled vehicles to the EPA Certification files. (See &quot;The Vehicle
    Identification Number&quot; section in Appendix A of the 1994 RTECS Internet report for a
    detailed discussion of the VIN).</li>
  <li>Households in the 1988, 1991 and 1994 RTECS did not receive a monetary incentive to
    participate, as they did in the 1985 RTECS. </li>
  <li>In the 1988 survey, the variable &quot;JOBUSE&quot; was coded &quot;1&quot; if the
    vehicle was used on the job, other than commuting, by anyone in the household. In the 1991
    survey, the variable was coded &quot;1&quot; only if the vehicle was used for commuting.
    In 1994, FCOMUT was coded &quot;1&quot; if the vehicle was used for commuting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Appendix A of the Internet-published report provides a more complete comparison of the
major differences between the 1994 RTECS and the 1991 RTECS. </p>

<p>Note: Tabulations of 1994 RTECS weighted households from the public use data do not
match tabulations from the published 1994 RTECS report due to the removal of households in
Alaska and Hawaii. <br>

<strong><a name="CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS">Confidentiality Provisions</a></strong> </p>

<p>Names and addresses of respondents are not provided to the EIA in order to maintain the
survey respondents' confidentiality and therefore are not provided on the public use
files. To further prevent the possible identification of individual survey households,
some changes were made to the original data before creating the public use data.
Potentially identifying geographic variables, such as sampling unit location variables and
weather-related variables, were removed from the data files. The VIN (Vehicle
Identification Number) collected from the respondent is 17 characters in length. The last
6 characters are those that uniquely identify a vehicle. Consequently, the last 6
characters on the diskettes were zero filled and only the first 11 characters of the VIN
on the public use diskettes are shown. Data for Alaska and Hawaii were removed. <br>
