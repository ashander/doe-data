              households used a fleet of nearly 157 million vehicles in 1994. 
              Despite remarkable growth in the number of minivans and sport-utility 
              vehicles, passenger cars continued to predominate in the residential 
              vehicle fleet. This chapter looks at changes in the composition 
              of the residential fleet in 1994 compared with earlier years and 
              reviews the effect of technological changes on fuel efficiency (how 
              efficiently a vehicle engine processes motor fuel) and fuel economy 
              (how far a vehicle travels on a given amount of fuel). Using data 
              unique to the Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey, 
              it also explores the relationship between residential vehicle use 
              and family income. </font></p>

              the 7-year period of 1988 through 1994, inflation-adjusted prices 
              of motor fuel (motor gasoline and diesel fuel) were well below the 
              peak prices of the early 1980's. For example, at its peak in 1981, 
              the adjusted price (in chained [1992] dollars<a
HREF="chapter2.html#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and including taxes) of unleaded regular motor 
              gasoline was $2.09 per gallon, whereas in 1994 the comparable price

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              motor fuel prices are relatively low, consumers have less incentive 
              for choosing vehicles with higher fuel economy ratings. And, in 
              fact, consumer preference for light trucks, which have significantly 
              lower fuel economy ratings than do passenger cars, was one factor 
              leading to the decline in the number of passenger cars. A second 
              factor contributing to the increase in light trucks' share of the 
              residential fleet was the continuing tendency of householders to 
              keep older light trucks in operation while retiring older passenger 
              cars. Those factors had their greatest effect in the West, where 
              light trucks make up a higher percentage of the residential vehicle 
              fleet than in other regions. </font></p>

              trucks and large vans, were taken out of service at a slower rate. 
              For example, the number of passenger cars of model year 1982 or 
              earlier fell from 57 million in 1988 to 20 million in 1994, meaning 
              that about two-thirds of those older passenger cars were retired 
              from the residential fleet over the 7-year period (Figure 2.5). 
              By comparison, the number of pre-1983 light trucks fell from 21

              cars meant that in the West old residential vehicles as a whole 
              were taken out of service at a slower rate than in the other regions 
              of the country. For example, vehicles of model year 1988 or earlier 
              accounted for a 64-percent share of all of the residential vehicles 
              in the West. In the other regions of the country, the shares were 
              lower: 59 percent in the Midwest and 57 percent each in the South 
              and Northeast. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              rural nature of much of the West may have contributed to the prevalence 
              of light trucks in the region. In general, rural areas had a higher 
              ratio of light trucks to passenger cars than did urban areas. Even 
              California, the most populous State in the West, had a ratio above 
              the national average. In California, 1 of every 3 residential vehicles 
              was a light truck. In contrast, in New York fewer than 1 in 4 was.

            <p ALIGN="center"><strong>Changes in Residential Vehicle Technology</strong></p>
            <p>The transportation sector relies almost entirely on petroleum. 
              Because it also accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. total petroleum 
              demand,<a HREF="chapter2.html#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> passenger cars and light 
              trucks became a focus of efforts to use petroleum more efficiently, 
              thereby restraining demand. </p>
            <p>The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required passenger 
              car and light truck manufacturers to meet corporate average fuel 
              economy (CAFE) standards applied on a fleet-wide basis for each 
              manufacturer.<a HREF="chapter2.html#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> The CAFE standards, 
              higher fuel prices in the 1970's and 1980's, and environmental quality 
              initiatives such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 all contributed 
              to increasing the demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. </p>
            <p>In turn, the demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles spurred improvements 
              in existing technologies and the development of new technologies. 
              For example, using lighter-weight materials and reducing the size 
              of vehicles led to lighter vehicles that consumed less fuel per 
              mile. </p>
            <p>Many improvements occurred in engine technology. Increasing the 
              number of valves per cylinder resulted in increased performance 
              from smaller, more fuel-efficient engines. Increasing the number 
              of gears in manual and automatic transmissions allowed engines to 
              operate at peak efficiency more of the time. Similarly, using lockup 
              torque converters to allow direct drive under some driving conditions 
              also increased fuel economy. </p>
            <p>One of the most far-reaching improvements in engine technology 
              concerned fuel injection, which was available but not widely used 
              prior to the mid-1980's. Valued for its greater fuel economy, as 
              well as for its ability to control carbon monoxide emissions and 
              to improve engine performance, fuel injection technology began to 
              penetrate the fleet during the 1980's, and it was improved to such 
              an extent that after 1990 virtually all new light-duty vehicles 
              were equipped with fuel injection instead of carburetors. By 1994, 
              the trend toward the use of fuel injection rather than carburetors 
              for fuel metering had brought the share of residential vehicles 
              using fuel injection to nearly half of the total residential fleet. 
              That share will increase rapidly in future years as older vehicles 
              are retired. </p>
            <p><strong><b>Engine Size Shrank and Then Increased Slowly</b></strong></p>
            <p>For model year 1975 (the year in which CAFE standards were first 
              mandated), residential vehicle engine size averaged 293 cubic inches 
              of displacement.<a HREF="chapter2.html#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> Twelve years 
              later, the engines were much smaller. Model year 1987 engines averaged 
              175 cubic inches (Figure 2.7). Thereafter, engine size trended upward, 
              reaching an average of 198 cubic inches of displacement for model 
              year 1995. </p>

              a single year, usually a recent year. In 1996, the U.S. Department
