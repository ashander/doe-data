        Amount</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">During the1983-to-1991 period, the overall fuel economy of the residential 
        fleet increased by nearly 28 percent (about 3.5 percent per year), which 
        helped to hold down total consumption. However, for the 1991-to-1994 period, 
        the overall increase in fuel economy from 19.3 miles per gallon (mpg) 
        to 19.8 mpg was less than 3 percent (less than 1 percent per year). The 
        large increase in the fleet fuel economy in the 1983-to-1991 period was 
        due primarily to two factors: vehicles manufactured after 1982 had better 
        fuel economy, and large numbers of pre-1983, lower fuel-economy vehicles 
        were taken out of service. Each year, there are fewer pre-1983 vehicles 
        to be replaced by newer vehicles, thus diminishing the opportunity for 
        further increases in overall fleet fuel economy through replacement of 
        older, lower fuel-economy vehicles with newer, higher fuel-economy vehicles. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The average fuel economy for the residential fleet was 19.8 mpg in 1994, 
        an 8-percent increase over 1988, when household vehicles averaged 18.3 
        mpg. Average fuel economy would have increased by a greater amount if 
        all technological improvements had been devoted solely to that purpose 
        rather than to increasing vehicle size and performance. Passenger cars, 
        averaging 21.9 mpg, had the highest fuel economy. Large vans, averaging 
        13.8 mpg, exhibited the worst fuel economy. </font></p>

        Improvement in Fuel Economy</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In general, fuel economy varies considerably by age and type of vehicle. 
        However, there was relatively little variation for model years 1980 and 
        later (Figure 4.1), which represented nearly 90 percent of all household 
        vehicles. If all vehicles of model years 1979 and earlier were removed 
        from the residential fleet, the overall fuel economy would only increase 
        from 19.8 mpg to 21.0 mpg. Any major increase in future years must therefore 
        derive not from the retirement of older vehicles but from improvements 
        in technology, and buying patterns of consumers. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the major factors 
        affecting the average fuel economy is the composition of the vehicle fleet. 
        New passenger cars in 1994 were subject to CAFE standards of 27.5 mpg 
        (unadjusted) and the overall passenger fleet averaged 21.9 mpg, compared 
        with 19.7 mpg in 1988 (Figure 4.2). New vehicles not classified as passenger 
        cars--pickup trucks, sport-utility vehicles, minivans, and large vans, 
        all classified as light-duty trucks-- were subject to lower CAFE standards 
        of 20.5 mpg (unadjusted) and the overall fleet averaged 16.8 mpg in 1994. 
        That average compares with 15.3 mpg in 1988. In 1994, large vans had the 
        lowest mpg average of any category of light-duty truck and minivans had 
        the highest. In addition to having lower CAFE standards, those vehicles 
        were also exempt from the &quot;gas guzzler&quot; tax, which may have 
        an effect on encouraging consumers to switch from larger, less fuel economic 
        passenger cars to vehicles like minivans and sport utility vehicles which 
        are even less fuel economic. </font></p>

        number of vehicles in the range between 13 and 21.9 mpg increased, especially 
        in the 16 to 18.9 miles per gallon category. Those intermediate ranges 
        are where many new minivans, sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and

        vehicles in residential households showed little variation by household 
        characteristics. Households without children did show an improvement in

        years of age, as compared with households in which the oldest adult was 
        60 years old or more (Figure 4.4). Household income appears to have had 
        even less effect on the fuel economy of vehicles in the household than 
        did household composition. Interestingly (although not statistically significant), 
        households with less than $5,000 of annual income had the most fuel-economic 
        vehicles (Figure 4.5). </font></p>

        a 9-percent increase. The nearly 8-billion-gallon increase was roughly

        of growing consumer preferences for minivans, pickup trucks, and sport-utility

        Characteristics</strong> </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">In households reporting owning or having access to at least 
        one vehicle in 1994, residential expenditures for energy for transportation 
        averaged $1,234. Which households were likely to spend more than the average? 
        And how did average residential expenditures compare with residential 
        expenditures for energy for all other uses, including space heating? </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2"><strong>Inflation-Adjusted Expenditures for Vehicle Fuel 
        Varied Very Little Over Time</strong> </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">The inflation-adjusted cost of purchasing fuel for residential 
        vehicles remained relatively constant from 1988 through 1994 (Figure 4.11). 
        During that period, the average fuel consumption per vehicle also changed 
        little. The improvement in fuel economy for the residential vehicle fleet 
        helped to keep expenditures and consumption nearly unchanged. </font></p>
