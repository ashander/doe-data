              number of miles traveled and the number of residential vehicles 
              increased, the total amount of paved and unpaved roadway remained 
              at about 3.9 million miles.<a HREF="chapter3.html#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Most 
              construction was aimed at improving, rather than extending, the 
              existing roadway system, about 40 percent of which was unpaved as 
              of 1994. In 1988, the average mile of roadway was traveled by residential 
              vehicles 1,066 times per day. In 1994, the number was 1,257, about 
              18 percent higher. (Because residential vehicles make up only about 
              four-fifths of the U.S. total fleet, there was, in fact, substantially 
              more total travel per mile of roadway.) These figures provide some

              Traveled by Light Trucks Increased the Fastest</b></strong> 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Largely because 
              light trucks' share of the residential fleet increased from 1988 
              to 1994, the number of miles traveled by light trucks, rather than 
              passenger cars, accounted for most of the increase in residential 
              vehicle-miles traveled. Light trucks traveled 56 percent more miles 
              in 1994 than they had in 1988, attaining an average growth rate 
              of 7.8 percent per year. By comparison, the number of vehicle-miles 
              traveled by passenger cars did not show a statistically significant 
              change. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Light trucks' 
              share of total vehicle-miles traveled rose from one-fourth in 1988 
              to one-third in 1994. The increase was the result of two factors. 
              Light trucks comprised a larger share of the residential fleet in 
              1994. In addition, two segments of the light truck fleet--minivans 
              and sport utility-vehicles--were driven more miles per year per 
              vehicle than were passenger cars. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Minivans 
              Were Driven the Most</strong> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Minivans, which 
              are owned primarily by families with children, tend to be driven 
              more than other types of vehicles. In 1994, the average minivan 
              was driven 13,400 miles, substantially more than the number of miles 
              traveled, on average, by passenger cars, pickup trucks, and large 
              vans. In general, households with children reported a higher number 
              of vehicle-miles traveled than did other households (see section 
              on &quot;Inside the Average U.S. Household: Who Drives Most?&quot;). 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Similarly, of 
              the two types of passenger cars, station wagons were used more on 
              average than were sedans. The average station wagon covered 12,100 
              miles in 1994, compared with 11,200 miles traveled by the average 
              sedan. </font></p>

              in the West Were Not Driven More Than in Other Regions</strong></font> 
            </p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems reasonable 
              that people living in the &quot;wide-open spaces&quot; of the West 
              would drive more than people living in urban areas of the West and 
              in other regions of the country. However, the average number of 
              miles traveled per vehicle in the West, 10,900 miles, was comparable 
              to the average for the rest of the United States (Figure 3.3). That 
              average was slightly lower than the averages in the South and the 
              Midwest, but not statistically different from the average in the 
              Northeast. The national average was 11,400 miles per vehicle in 
              1994. </font></p>

              Table 5.15 in this report. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, the 
              vehicle-miles-traveled averages may have masked significant variations 
              in State and local areas, such as the less populous States located 
              in the West. Other Energy Information Administration data sources, 
              most notably, State-level motor gasoline consumption estimates, 
              suggest wide variability in fuel use per capita. For example, motor 
              gasoline consumption in the most fuel-intensive State (Wyoming) 
              is more than twice that of consumption in the least-intensive State 
              (New York). However, even in sparsely populated States such as Wyoming, 
              most of the population lives in urban areas, so that a large part 
              of personal travel could be local. Why then would motor gasoline 
              use per capita vary so widely? </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are good 
              reasons why per capita motor gasoline consumption may not be directly 
              correlated with per capita vehicle-miles traveled. Estimates of 
              total motor gasoline consumption could be greatly influenced by 
              tourists visiting the State in numbers that are many times the size 
              of the resident population. In addition, some western States with 
              small populations have major cross-country interstate highways passing 
              through. Vehicles traveling on such highways consume motor gasoline 
              that is then counted in that State's consumption. Tourists and through 
              traffic, largely unassociated with travel by State residents, would 
              have the greatest relative effect on per capita ratios in States 
              with large geographic areas and small populations. As an example, 
              in 1994 over 7 million people visited Wyoming with its population 
              of 476 thousand, according to the Wyoming Department of Tourism. 
              In order for tourism to have had the same relative effect in California, 
              almost everyone in the United States would have had to have visited 
              California nearly two times in 1994. </font></p>

              Vehicles Are Driven More than Older Vehicles</strong> </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vehicle age 
              is closely correlated with the number of miles traveled: the newer 
              the vehicle, the more miles it is driven, on average (Figure 3.4). 
              In 1994, the newest vehicles (model years 1994 and 1995<a HREF="chapter3.html#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) 
              were driven 14,300 miles, about 1.7 times as much as were the oldest 
              vehicles (model years earlier than 1980, that is, vehicles at least 
              14 years old in 1994). </font></p>

              been in 1988. In 1988, the newest vehicles were driven 12,900 miles, 
              more than twice as much as were the oldest vehicles (those more 
              than 14 years old in 1988). The likely explanation for this trend 
              is that the oldest vehicles remaining in the residential fleet in 
              1994 were relatively newer, more fuel efficient, and probably more 
              reliable than were the oldest vehicles in the 1988 fleet. </font></p>

              average of about 85 million U.S. households with vehicles in 1994, 
              and the average masks significant variation. For example, typical 
              householder A, an older person whose children had left home, drove 
              only 8,600 miles in 1994. That same year, people in typical household

              analysts can correlate the number of miles driven per household

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As explained 
              in the previous section, in 1994, the number of vehicles per household, 
              1.8, was about the same as it had been in 1988, so that per-household 
              mileage increased at the same rate as per-vehicle mileage. In 1988, 
              the per-household average was 18,595 miles, compared with the 21,100 
              miles averaged in 1994. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People in households 
              of all sizes drove more in 1994 than in 1988 (Figure 3.5). The difference 
              between miles traveled in 1988 versus 1994 was dwarfed by the difference 
              between miles traveled in the smallest households versus the largest. 
              Travel in single-person households averaged 11,600 miles in 1994, 
              about 800 miles more than in 1988. Travel in the typical household 
              of four averaged 26,600, about 3,300 miles more than in 1988 but 
              15,000 more than the smallest households. </font></p>

              household raised the number of vehicle-miles traveled by a factor 
              of 2.2. Having three drivers in the household raised the number 
              by a factor of 2.7. People in the average household with three drivers

              people in households with children drive more, and those with driving-age 
              children traveled the most vehicle-miles of any category in 1994: 
              29,900 miles (Figure 3.7). First, the presence of children of driving 
              age tends to increase the number of drivers in the household and, 
              therefore, to increase the number of vehicle-miles traveled. Secondly, 
              older children may create additional travel demands than do younger 
              children. In households with younger children, the number of vehicle-miles 
              driven is similar to the number of miles driven in households with 
              two or more adults with no children and in which the householder 
              is younger than 60. In fact, households with two adults or more 
              registered the greatest 1988-to-1994 increase in the number of vehicle-miles 
              traveled. </font></p>

              miles than do primary drivers younger than 50 (Figure 3.8). After 
              age 49, the older the primary driver, the fewer were the vehicle-miles 
              traveled per year in general. As primary drivers, those 80 years

              when coupled with the presence of teenagers of driving age in the 
              household, boosted average vehicle-miles traveled per household 
              to 40,200 miles in 1994. And in households with that income and 
              with two or more adults and no children, vehicle-miles traveled 
              averaged nearly 27,400. By comparison, in those households with

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Household income 
              does <em>not</em> correlate appreciably with the number of vehicle-miles 
              traveled <em>per vehicle</em>. However, there is a correlation between 
              household income and the number of vehicles per household (Figure 
              3.10). High-income households tend to have more vehicles and thus 
              a higher per-household average of vehicle-miles traveled. It is 
              important to note that, in general, there is a positive correlation 
              between higher household income, older age of head of household, 
              a greater number of drivers, and an increased likelihood that the 
              household will include children of driving age--all factors associated 
              with a higher number of vehicle-miles per household. Households 
              that include children 16 or 17 years old tend to have an older head 
              of household. Older householders tend to have been in the work force 
              longer, to have a correspondingly higher income, and to have more 
              vehicles. For example, households with annual incomes of $50,000 
              or higher have nearly twice as many vehicles as do households with 
              annual incomes below $10,000. </font></p>
