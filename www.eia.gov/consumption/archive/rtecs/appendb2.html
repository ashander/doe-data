            <p><font color="#000066" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Statistics 
              concerning vehicle miles traveled (VMT), vehicle fuel efficiency 
              (given in terms of miles per gallon (MPG)), vehicle fuel consumption, 
              and vehicle fuel expenditures are presented in this report. The 
              methodology used to estimate these statistics relied on data from 
              the 1993 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), the 1994 
              Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey (RTECS), the 
              U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel efficiency test 
              results, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) retail pump price 
              series, and the Lundberg Survey, Inc., price series for 1994. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#000066" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              estimation of these four statistics (VMT, vehicle fuel efficiency, 
              vehicle fuel consumption, and vehicle fuel expenditures) occurred 
              in several steps (Figure B1). First, for each RTECS vehicle, the 
              VMT were determined from two actual odometer readings or imputed 
              using data from the 1993 RECS. Second, the annual on-road fuel efficiency, 
              given in terms of MPG, was estimated using the questionnaire responses, 
              decoded Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) data, EPA fuel efficiency 
              test results, and the months that the vehicle was in use. The MPG 
              were adjusted to account for the difference between EPA test values 
              and on-road values. Third, estimated vehicle fuel consumption was 
              derived by dividing the VMT by the estimated MPG. Finally, the estimated 
              vehicle fuel expenditures were derived by multiplying the vehicle 
              fuel consumption by the fuel price. The 1994 RTECS, like the 1988 
              RTECS, did not collect vehicle fuel prices via fuel purchase diaries. 
              Instead each RTECS vehicle was assigned a price based on reported 
              fuel type used in each vehicle. Gasoline prices were obtained from 
              the BLS 1994 Retail Gasoline Pump Price Series. Diesel fuel prices 
              were obtained from the Lundberg Survey, Inc. (See &quot;Other Fuel 
              Types&quot; in this appendix for a discussion of the gasohol and 
              propane prices.) </font></p>

            <p><font color="#000066" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              possible, VMT were determined for a sample vehicle by taking the 
              difference between two odometer readings, which spanned a period 
              of time. This method was used to determine VMT for 2,648 (48 percent) 
              of the 5,553 RTECS sample vehicles. Attempts were made to obtain 
              odometer readings during the RECS interviews, the End-of-Year (E-O-Y) 
              RTECS interview and any time a vehicle was acquired or disposed. 
              A &quot;span&quot; of odometer readings was the difference between 
              two odometer readings. In most cases, this span was a B-O-Y to E-O-Y 
              span, although due to an occasional nonresponse, only shorter spans 
              were obtained, such as RECS to B-O-Y. Odometer spans of less than 
              a full year were also obtained for vehicles that were either acquired 
              or disposed of during the survey year. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#000066" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              VMT that were assigned to each RTECS vehicle corresponded to the 
              period of time that the vehicle was in possession by the sample 
              household. In most cases, however, this period of possession did 
              not correspond exactly with the beginning and ending dates for the 
              odometer span. This was true even for vehicles with a complete B-O-Y 
              to E-O-Y odometer span; because odometer cards were mailed to respondents 
              in several distinct waves at the beginning and end of the RTECS 
              survey; and because the exact dates of odometer readings were often 
              left to the convenience of the respondents. Therefore, all VMT obtained 
              from odometer spans were adjusted to correspond to the period of 
              time that the vehicle was in possession by the sample household. 
              A 2-step adjustment procedure was used. STEP 1 adjusted the odometer-span 
              VMT to a standard annualized mileage covering 365 days, and STEP 
              2 readjusted the annualized VMT to correspond to the exact period 
              of time that the vehicle was in possession by the household. These 
              adjustments took into account a typical distribution of VMT fractions 
              among the different months of the year. Step 2 was performed only 
              for vehicles that were not in the possession of the household for 
              the entire calendar year 1994. </font></p>

              of Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Volume data for 
              1994 was conducted. This study resulted in FHWA VMT fractions being 
              constructed for 1984 and 1993. FHWA 1993 data were used since the 
              1994 data for the entire year was unavailable. Annual VMT calculations 
              were completed using both the NPD and FHWA fractions. The differences 
              in average annual VMT per vehicle between using the NPD and FHWA 
              VMT fractions ranged between 1 and 18 miles and were less than the 
              standard errors of the average annual VMT. Therefore, in 1994 the 
              NPD VMT fractions given in Table B1 will be used to compute annualized
              VMT since the differences in annual VMT between using the NPD and 
              FHWA fractions were minor (RTECS Technote 5[3]). </font></p>

              during the RECS interview. VMT for these vehicles were imputed from 
              a regression on the estimated VMT obtained from the RECS. For another 
              978 sample vehicles (17 percent), no odometer span was available 
              and a VMT estimate was not obtained during the RECS interview. VMT 
              for these vehicles were imputed using a multiple linear regression 
              model, where the independent variables were number of drivers, household 
              income, age of household head, type of vehicle, and use of vehicle 
              on the job. This regression was also used for imputing VMT for vehicles 
              that were imputed as being acquired or disposed. Both of the regression 
              models described above yielded estimates of annualized VMT. The 
              STEP 2 adjustment described previously was then used to adjust this

            <p><font color="#000066" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fuel 
              efficiency (MPG) must be estimated for each RTECS sample vehicle 
              in order to estimate each vehicle's fuel consumption for the survey 
              year. (Fuel consumption is estimated by dividing the VMT for time 
              of possession, by the MPG.) Prior to 1988, the RTECS obtained actual 
              fuel consumption data and on-road MPG from fuel purchase diaries 
              maintained by the respondents. However, no fuel purchase diaries 
              were used in the 1988 thru 1994 RTECS. Instead, the 1994 MPG were 
              estimated using EPA laboratory test MPG that were adjusted to account 
              for differences between actual on-road MPG and the EPA test MPG. 
              This difference is known as MPG &quot;shortfall.&quot; The feasibility 
              of using shortfall-adjusted MPG in an RTECS survey was investigated 
              by Lax, 1987[6]. That study verified that the method yielded unbiased 
              MPG, when using a data base from a 1984 fuel purchase diary study 
              performed by NPD Research, Inc. The adequacy of current shortfall 
              adjustment methods is sufficient for late 1980 through early 1993's 
              motor vehicle model years also (RTECS Technote 5[3]). </font></p>

              RTECS sample vehicles were assigned EPA test MPG from the EPA Emissions

              EPA test MPG for each unique combination of vehicle attributes within 
              a given make, model, and year. These attributes were (1) number 
              of cylinders, (2) cubic inches of engine displacement (CID), (3) 
              type of transmission (manual or automatic), (4) gasoline or diesel 
              fuel, and (5) whether the vehicle's emissions control package met 
              Federal or California standards. Each record of the Certification 
              Files also contained the number of vehicles sold for each unique 
              combination of attributes. The vehicle attributes needed to assign 
              a test MPG for sample vehicles were obtained from the Vehicle Identification 
              Number (VIN), and/or from the RTECS questionnaire responses when 
              the VIN was unavailable. The VIN was decoded to yield the vehicle

              records from the EPA Certification Files were usually found as potential 
              &quot;matches&quot; to a given sample vehicle. A matching record 
              was chosen from among the several applicable ones, with probability 
              proportional to sales, using the sales figures on the EPA Certification

              in the early 1970's, EPA measured fuel efficiency from tests that 
              were conducted on a dynamometer to simulate actual driving conditions. 
              By 1975, EPA had incorporated separate &quot;city&quot; and &quot;highway&quot; 
              driving cycles into the test. The city and highway MPG were combined 
              to form a &quot;composite&quot; MPG, that was then weighted according 
              to sales of the production vehicles in order to assess compliance 
              with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. The EPA Composite 
              MPG is based on the assumption of a &quot;typical&quot; vehicle-use 
              pattern of 55 percent city driving and 45 percent highway driving,

              Reasons for this shortfall are (1) a result of the differences between 
              EPA test vehicles and the vehicles actually in use and (2) the differences 
              between EPA procedures for simulated driving conditions and actual 
              driving conditions. For example, EPA test vehicles are prototypes 
              that do not contain the wide variety of power-consuming accessories 
              often found on vehicles sold to consumers. The test procedures also 
              do not simulate the actual driving conditions that affect fuel efficiency 
              such as speed and acceleration of individual drivers, road conditions, 
              weather, and traffic. In the 1994 RTECS, adjustments for this fuel 
              efficiency shortfall were made to the composite MPG (MPG<sub>(EPA

              EPA developed two general procedures for adjusting MPG<sub>(EPA

              the adjustment on specific technology features of the vehicle. The 
              other procedure uses just two MPG discount factors, one to adjust 
              the EPA highway estimate, the other to adjust the city estimate. 
              These two factors are used for all vehicles, regardless of technology 
              class. Either of these procedures could be used to adjust MPG<sub>(EPA 
              55/45)</sub> to an on-road MPG value for use in the 1994 RTECS. 
              Since both procedures were unbiased for trucks, the choice as to 
              which to employ in the 1994 RTECS should be based on their performance 
              with cars. The adjustment based on discount factors seemed to be 
              less biased than the Technology-Specific Adjustment. The discount 
              factors are also less expensive since they do not require collection 
              or imputation of information on fuel delivery system and drive-train.

              the DOE/EPA <em>Gas Mileage Guide</em>. The analysis behind the 
              development of these factors was performed on a conglomerate data 
              base with data from Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Chrysler 
              Corporation, DOE, and EPA. The data base contained approximately 
              38,000 vehicle records with model years from 1979 through 1981 with 
              some 1982 models included. The data base contained predominately 
              American-made vehicles, but also included foreign vehicles as well. 
              The technology mix was dominated by rear-wheel drive and carbureted 
              vehicles, but contained some vehicles with front-wheel drive or 
              fuel injection. Vehicle records contained make, model, year, vehicle

              the driver's perceptions of the proportion of their travel that

              average miles driven per day (AMPD). </font></p>

              economy shortfall is affected by the vehicle use pattern: city-driving

              while highway-driving pattern is characterized by infrequent starts 
              and long trips. AMPD is a good surrogate variable for representing 
              these different driving patterns. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#000066" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              city-driving pattern was characterized by AMPD from 5 to 22 miles

              AMPD's from 15 to 105 miles per day (Hellman and Murrell, 1984). 
              City fraction and AMPD were used to split the data into two sets, 
              one for development of the city discount factor, the other for development 
              of the highway factor. The &quot;city&quot; and &quot;highway&quot; 
              data sets were each stratified by vehicle technology classes. Linear 
              regression was performed within each stratum. GPMR was regressed 
              on city fraction, AMPD, MPG<sub>(EPA 55/45)</sub>, odometer reading, 
              and average temperature. The fitted models were then weighted and 
              combined across vehicle technology strata, to produce a single &quot;city&quot; 
              shortfall model and a single &quot;highway&quot; shortfall model. 
              The weights were used to increase the influence of those models 
              that represented technology mixes expected to become more prominent 
              in the future (e.g., front-wheel drive and fuel-injected vehicles). 
              The discount factors were derived from the two weighted models set

              the 1994 RTECS data. The model had two components. One component

              equation also contained a minor term which accounted for the influence 
              of air-conditioner use during hot, humid weather. This term was 
              dropped in the 1994 RTECS estimations because it involved the rather 
              complex computation of &quot;Discomfort Index&quot; from NOAA weather 
              records, and the slight additional precision was judged insufficient 
              to warrant the additional processing expense. Additional terms representing 
              geographic regional effects, and the natural logarithm of population 
              density (people per square mile, to represent the influence of traffic 
              congestion) were not considered because of the computational cost.

              the 1994 RTECS, fuel expenditures were calculated by multiplying 
              the vehicle-fuel consumption by the price of the vehicle fuel. The 
              1994 RTECS, like the 1988 and 1991 RTECS, did not collect vehicle 
              fuel prices via fuel purchase diaries. Instead, each RTECS vehicle 
              was assigned a price based on reported fuel type used in the vehicle. 
              Gasoline prices were obtained from the BLS 1994 Retail Gasoline 
              Pump Price Series. Diesel fuel prices were obtained from the Lundberg 
              Survey, Inc. (See &quot;Other Fuel Types&quot; in this appendix 
              for a discussion of the gasohol and propane prices.) </font></p>

              were asked if they purchased leaded or unleaded gasoline, and if 
              unleaded, they were asked the grade. (See Appendix D, &quot;Survey 
              Forms.&quot;) The BLS prices are published by month, by Census region, 
              and by type and grade of fuel. In 1988, the BLS monthly prices (for 
              the Census region in which the household lived) were averaged across 
              the months that the vehicle was in the possession of the household. 
              This yielded for each RTECS vehicle a single fuel price, P<sub>i</sub>, 
              dependent on the Census region, type and grade of gasoline, and 
              the months that the vehicle was in the possession of the household. 
              In 1988, the annual fuel expenditures in dollars for each sample 
              vehicle, E<sub>i</sub>, was estimated by multiplying its assigned 
              average fuel price, P<sub>i</sub>, by its total consumption in gallons, 
              C<sub>i</sub>, as estimated in the previous section. However, in 
              1994, annual fuel expenditures, E<sub>i</sub>, was estimated by 
              multiplying monthly gasoline prices by monthly consumption to produce 
              monthly expenditures and summing the monthly expenditures to produce 
              annual expenditures. </font></p>
