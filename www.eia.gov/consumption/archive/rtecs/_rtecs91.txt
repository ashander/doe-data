   1991 Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey
                        Public Use Data
                                
The data from the 1991 RTECS is distributed in DBase and ASCii format on three diskettes
each.  The data on the six diskettes have been compressed into 6 zip files with an
extension of  zip.  After downloading the files, they should be placed in a separate directory and
expanded by expanding using a pkunzip program.  The file names and sizes are:

RT91ASC1.ZIP        761,251 bytes
RT91ASC2.ZIP        683,786 bytes
RT91ASC3.ZIP        672,370 bytes

RT91DB1.ZIP         761,607 bytes
RT91DB2.ZIP       1,052,524 bytes
RT91DB3.ZIP         271,241 bytes

There is a readme file in the first file of each format.  The documentation refers to the files as
being compressed with ARC and DBA.  However these files have all been compressed into ZIP files for ease of use and will expand to the proper ASCII and DBASE format.
