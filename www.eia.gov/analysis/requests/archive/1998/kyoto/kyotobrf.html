<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p><font face="Arial" size="6"><sub>T</sub></font><font face="Arial" size="2">he Kyoto Protocol, negotiated by more than 160 nations in
            December 1997, aims to reduce net emissions of certain greenhouse gases (primarily carbon
            dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)). Each of the participating developed countries must decide how
            to meet its respective reduction goal during a five-year period (2008-2012); but specific
            ground rules remain to be worked out at future negotiating sessions. The next meeting is
            in Buenos Aires (November 1998).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a study entitled <em>Impacts of the
            Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets and Economic Activity</em>, the Energy Information
            Administration (EIA), an independent statistical and analytical agency in the U.S.
            Department of Energy, has projected that meeting the U.S. targets under the Protocol will
            call for significant market adjustments:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will
              result in between 18 and 77 percent less coal use than projected in the EIA Reference Case
              in 2010, particularly affecting electricity generation, and between 2 and 13 percent less
              petroleum use, mainly affecting transportation.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Energy consumers will need to use between 2
              and 12 percent more natural gas in 2010 and between 2 and 16 percent more renewable
              energy, and extend the operating life of existing nuclear units.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To achieve these ends via market-based
              means, average delivered energy costs (in inflation-adjusted 1996 dollars) must be between
              17 and 83 percent higher than projected in 2010.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The amount prices must rise is uncertain.
              Accounting procedures and international trading rules for greenhouse gases are not
              finalized. Forecasting technological change and public response to it under various
              pricing scenarios is an inexact science. The more stringent the need for domestic emission
              reductions, however, the more costly the adjustment process will be.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA undertook this study in response to a
            request by the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Science that
            it analyze impacts of the Protocol (which the President has not yet submitted to the U.S.
            Senate for ratification) on U.S. energy use, prices, and the general economy in the
            2008-2012 time frame. That is when this country is supposed to reach an average level of
            net greenhouse gas emissions 7 percent lower than they were in 1990--having shown
            demonstrable progress toward that goal by 2005. At the Committee's request, EIA assumed
            that actions begin in 2005.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA was asked to do the study for several
            reasons. More than 80 percent of the human-originated greenhouse gas emissions are
            energy-related. EIA's National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) is perhaps the most complete,
            integrated, regional computer model available to simulate all elements of U.S. energy
            supply and demand in the context of the full U.S. macroeconomy. NEMS presents year-by-year
            projections over a 20-year horizon, accounting for capital stock turnover and the
            availability and penetration of specific energy-consuming technologies. Its annual
            &quot;Reference Case&quot; assumes no change from existing laws and regulations, and so it
            provides a base from which to evaluate policy options or alternative assumptions.</font></p>

            <small>Carbon Emissions To Comply with the Kyoto Protocol</small></strong></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="1" face="Arial" ><strong>Reference</strong>--A
            reference case (based on Annual Energy Outlook 1998) with no new actions to reduce carbon
            emissions. <strong>1990+24%</strong>--Substantial international activities, including
            trading of &quot;carbon emission permits&quot;, but with some new domestic actions to
            reduce carbon. <strong>1990+14%</strong>--Stabilization at roughly 1998 levels. <strong>1990+9%</strong>--Moderate
            level of international activities as well as offsets from other gases and carbon sinks. <strong>1990</strong>--Equivalent
            to 1990 emissions. <strong>1990-3%</strong>--Substantial domestic actions, plus offsets
            and sinks. <strong>1990-7%</strong>--Kyoto Protocol target for U.S. lowers 1990 emissions
            by 7%, with none of the offsets, sinks, trading in the previous cases. (All carbon
            reduction cases represent average emissions for 2008-2012.) Percentages shown represent
            deviation from the 1990 level. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA analyzed six cases to investigate the
            uncertain range of impacts which could result from the Kyoto Protocol. Differences among
            the cases analyzed arise from three facts: 1) The Protocol gives credit for &quot;CO<sub>2</sub>-
            equivalent&quot; reductions in five gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>--methane, nitrous
            oxide, and three synthetic gases--as well as for certain actions that take carbon out of
            the atmosphere (such as preserving or extending forests); 2) participating developed
            countries are allowed to sell excess &quot;permits&quot; (e.g., because of economic
            problems since 1990 in the participating countries of the former Soviet Union, they may
            have about 165 million metric tons of carbon permits easily available); and 3) support for
            effective programs in other countries can earn permits. Details of this last process
            (called &quot;Joint Implementation&quot; among developed countries and the &quot;Clean
            Development Mechanism,&quot; or CDM, for developing countries) are unsettled.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA's six cases cover a range of reductions
            in energy-linked carbon emissions from an annual average of 122 million metric tons below
            the expected baseline emissions (1990+24% Case) to 542 million metric tons (1990-7% Case)
            in 2008-2012. In the 1990+24% Case, domestic actions may furnish about one-fifth of all
            reductions, with the rest coming from international activities (including trading),
            offsets of other gases, and carbon sinks in the U.S., while the 1990+9% Case assumes that
            nearly 60 percent of the reductions result from such domestic initiatives as
            fuel-switching, improved technology, and cutbacks in energy use. EIA did not separately
            calculate the contributions of international activities, offsets or sinks for any case.
            The 1990-3% Case assumes all reductions are from domestic actions, with a 4 percentage
            
            point contribution from sinks and offsets from other gases. In the 1990-7% case, all
            reductions must come from domestic energy-related reductions.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Kyoto Protocol does not specify targets
            for greenhouse gases after the period 2008-2012. At the Committee's request, EIA held the
            target for energy-related carbon emissions in the commitment period constant to 2020, the
            end of the forecast horizon. Targets following the 2008-2012 period will be a topic at
            future negotiating sessions.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/images/pg04abig.jpg"><small><strong>&quot;Carbon
            Price&quot; For a Range of Deviations From 1990 Carbon Emission Levels</strong></small></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To reduce carbon emissions,
            EIA assumes that a &quot;carbon price&quot; is added to the price of delivered energy
            fuels based on their carbon content. For example, coal prices rise more than petroleum and
            natural gas prices; and the cost of generating electricity from non-carbon-emitting
            nuclear and renewable fuels is not increased due to the carbon price. Although electricity
            
            does not have the carbon price directly added to it, its price is increased due to the
            higher cost of fossil fuels used for generation.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The price increases encourage a reduction
            in the use of energy services (heating, lighting, and travel, for example), the adoption
            of more energy-efficient equipment, and a shift to less carbon-intensive fuels. The carbon
            price reflects the amount fossil fuel prices in the U.S., adjusted for the carbon content
            of the fuel, must rise to achieve the removal of the last ton of carbon emissions that
            meets the carbon reduction target in each case. </font></p>
          <p><a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/images/pg04bbig.jpg"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><small><strong>&quot;Carbon
            Price&quot; Rises with Higher Emissions Reductions, 2008-2012</strong></small></font></a></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In most of the cases, the
            carbon price peaks early in the 2008-2012 period, reaching between $67 and $348 per metric
            ton in 2010, and then declines as energy markets adjust and more efficient, new
            technologies become available and gradually penetrate the market. In the least stringent
            reduction cases, the increase is more gradual throughout the period because less severe
            reductions need to be made. Looking at average carbon prices over the commitment period
            2008 to 2012 shows how the cost of compliance increases with increasingly stringent
            targets.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Differences in the cost of energy will
            affect the outlook for U.S. jobs, consumer prices, investment, technical change, and
            economic growth. Whenever use of a factor of production such as energy is restricted,
            economic performance falls for some period of time, the price of energy and other goods
            and services rises, and consumption and employment decline. Hence the various cases affect
            the national economy to varying degrees.<br />

              <a name="energymix" id="energymix">Electricity and Coal Industries Face Major Adjustments</a></strong></font></p>
          <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="5"><sub>W</sub></font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2">ell over one-third of all primary energy consumed by
            the United States today goes into producing and delivering electricity. At the point of
            use, electricity can be highly efficient; and there are certain end uses where fuel
            substitution is not feasible. More than one-half of all U.S. electricity generated in 1997
            was produced from coal--a fuel that emits more carbon dioxide during combustion than any
            other fossil fuel. Thus, electricity production and consumption is likely to be a major
            focus in meeting Kyoto targets, accounting for between two-thirds and three-fourths of the
            domestic carbon reductions in 2010 in the various cases examined. Historically, this
            industry has responded when relative fuel prices have changed. </font></p>

            of Fuels Used to Generate Electricity in the 1990 +9% Case</strong></small></font></a></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because coal is the most
            carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels, delivered prices for coal are affected by carbon
            prices more than other fuel prices. They are between 153 and 800 percent higher in 2010.
            The various cases studied for show prices for electricity between 20 and 86 percent higher
            in all end-use sectors, reflecting both the increased fuel costs and the incremental
            
            capital investments for non-coal generating capacity--either by traditional utilities or
            by non-utility generators in an increasingly restructured industry. The price rise for
            electricity is moderated somewhat by the fact that fuel is only part of the cost of
            generating electricity and that the cost of generation from renewables and nuclear power
            are unaffected by carbon prices. Neither of these fuels, however, can replace significant
            amounts of coal in the 2008-2012 timeframe. By 2020, non-hydro renewables (chiefly wind
            turbines, biomass in advanced technological applications, and to a lesser extent,
            geothermal facilities) penetrate the market in a significant way--providing as much as
            one-fifth of generation at the highest carbon prices. While hydroelectric dams have
            accounted for four-fifths of the renewable energy used for U.S. electricity production to
            date, the expansion of hydroelectric capacity is capital-intensive and is likely to meet
            with environmental objections; thus little additional hydroelectric capacity is expected.
            The bulk of the substitution for coal generation would be natural gas, because of its
            lower carbon content and the high efficiency of gas-fired combined cycle plants.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Furthermore, demand for industrial steam
            coal and metallurgical coal is also reduced because of a shift to natural gas in
            industrial boilers and a reduction in industrial output. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" ><strong> </strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Because domestic coal consumption is between 18 and
            77 percent lower in 2010 in the carbon reduction cases, there would be ripple effects on
            the industry. For example, even though total coal production drops, the average price per
            ton for coal at the minemouth in 2010 is between 3 and 28 percent higher than the
            Reference Case price. This is because a larger share of production would come from
            higher-cost Eastern coal mines, which tend to serve the remaining markets. Carbon prices
            raise the cost of rail transportation (involved now in delivering two-thirds of all coal)
            and make Western coal less competitive. The production of Western coal is discouraged
            further by the reduced size of the market and the reduced profitability of investing in
            new coal mines (which have been mostly in the West).</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For the past two decades or
            so, the number of coal miners in this country has been declining by nearly 6 percent per
            year, primarily as a result of improved labor productivity (especially in large Western
            surface mines). Without taking the Kyoto Protocol in consideration, the Reference Case
            already projects a further employment drop of more than 15 percent--leaving only about
            69,000 U.S. coal miners by 2010. In the carbon reduction cases, between 10,000 and 43,000
            more jobs could be lost. Some of these job losses could be offset by growth in employment
            in the natural gas and renewable industries.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While no new nuclear power plants are
            considered in these cases, extending the licenses of existing plants is projected to
            become more economical with higher carbon prices. In more stringent carbon reduction
            cases, most existing nuclear plants are operated through 2020, in contrast to the
            Reference Case outlook that projected about half of the nuclear plants would be retired by
            that time.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although reduced demand for electricity and
            improved efficiency in its generation can contribute to reducing carbon emissions from
            electricity generation, fuel-switching accounts for most of the reductions. In the short
            run, power suppliers would increase their use of less carbon-intensive plants, including
            steam plants that use oil and gas to heat their boilers. Much more efficient and
            cost-effective combined-cycle systems increase their share as new capacity is added.</font></p>
