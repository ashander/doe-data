<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

            Cost-of-Living Impacted During the Transition Period</font></strong></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">Even though energy represents only about 7 percent of our Gross
            Domestic Product (GDP), it is a crucial factor in virtually all the goods and services we
            produce and consume. The effects of alternative carbon scenarios can be expressed in terms
            of their impacts on the economy as a whole (e.g., GDP, capital investment, prevailing
            interest rates, inflation rates) as well as their impacts on individual families and
            enterprises (e.g., increased expenditures on energy, disposable income). </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">When energy costs rise, other factors of
            production--including labor and capital--become relatively less expensive. Energy price
            increases encourage adjustments in which labor and capital are substituted for more
            expensive energy to the extent practicable. In the process however, some economic
            potential is lost. This reduces the &quot;potential&quot; GDP for the Nation. EIA
            calculates that such losses would range from $13 billion to $72 billion in 2010 (1992
            dollars). In an economy today of over $7 trillion, which is expected to grow to over $9.4
            trillion (1992 dollars) in 2010, the percentage loss in output ranges from 0.1 percent to
            0.8 percent. In this context, the economy continues to grow, but at a slower rate.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">Because it takes time to adjust to a new
            set of factor-costs, however, there are, in addition to losses in potential GDP,
            transitional costs--which probably cannot be avoided entirely. Such short-run costs arise
            whenever price increases disrupt capital or employment markets. The transitional costs are
            very uncertain, but possibly very significant. They impact the &quot;actual&quot; GDP.
            Hence, the actual GDP losses are greater than the &quot;potential&quot; losses. The
            transitional costs can be softened to the extent that price changes are anticipated and
            appropriate compensatory adjustments can be made to Federal monetary and fiscal policies. </font></p>

          Annual
    Growth Rates in Potential and Actual Gross Domestic Product, 2005-2010
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial"  size="2">This analysis assumes a
            carbon-permit trading system is introduced in the form of an auction run by the Federal
            Government (to focus on the most economically efficient means of reducing carbon
            emissions). The domestic auction would produce substantial revenue. This study assumes
            that the revenues would be recycled back into the economy to bolster disposable income and
            encourage both consumption and investment, counteracting the adverse short-term effects on
            the economy associated with higher energy prices and speeding the transition to
            equilibrium. Taking money out of the economy through a carbon price and then returning it
            encourages a shift in priorities that accomplishes the goal of achieving a carbon
            emissions reduction while moderating the impacts on the economy. It modifies the national
            energy mix and makes the overall economy less energy-intensive, while partly compensating
            consumers and business for the loss in income resulting from higher energy prices. EIA
            evaluates two illustrative recycling cases: one providing rebates via reductions in the
            personal income tax, and the other through the social security tax. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">EIA projects the loss in actual GDP in 2010
            to range between $61 billion and $183 billion if revenues are recycled via a reduction in
            social security taxes, and between $96 billion and $397 billion if they are recycled via a
            reduction in personal income taxes (1992 dollars). Again, the economy grows even during
            the period of adjustment but does not reach the levels of growth in potential GDP.
            Although there is a definite slowing of economic growth during the transition period,
            actual GDP returns to its potential path, so the effects on the economy are almost totally
            muted over the longer term.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">The total cost to the economy can be
            estimated as the loss in actual GDP (the loss in potential GDP plus the macroeconomic
            adjustment cost) plus the purchase of international permits. It is assumed that the U.S.
            will purchase international permits at the marginal abatement cost in the U.S., i.e., the
            domestic carbon price. Total costs range from an average annual level for the period 2008
            to 2012 of $77 billion to $338 billion 1992 dollars depending on the carbon reduction case
            and how funds are recycled back to the economy.</font></p>

          Annual
    Cost of Carbon Reductions to the U.S. Economy, 2008-2012
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">As energy prices rise in the United States,
            downstream prices for all goods and services are affected. A rule of thumb for the year
            2010 is that each 10-percent increase in the level of aggregate energy prices may lead to
            a 1.5- percent increase in producer prices and a 0.7- percent increase in consumer prices.
            Final prices for goods and services in the 1990+9% case, as shown by the CPI, are
            approximately 3.5 percent higher than the Reference Case by 2010 if carbon permit revenues
            are recycled through a personal income tax rebate, and 2.0 percent higher if revenues are
            recycled through a social security tax rebate.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">Throughout these cases, the role of
            monetary policy is critical. Higher energy prices place upward pressure on interest rates.
            Based on past behavior of the Federal Reserve Board, it is assumed that they will adjust
            interest rates to moderate the impact on the economy and return it to its long-run path.</font></p>
          <p><a href="refcases.html">For
            Reference: A Matrix of Variables for Cases Analyzed by EIA </a></p>
          <p><strong><a name="proj" id="proj"></a>Would Some Changes
            In Assumptions Revise These Projections? How? How Much?</strong></p>
          <p>The House Science Committee asked EIA to determine how sensitive
            the results of its analysis might be to changes in three basic assumptions made for the
            Reference Case. These were analyzed against the 1990+9% Case, except for the changes in
            nuclear power assumptions. The changes can be framed as three questions.</p>
          <p><strong>Suppose . . . </strong>underlying
            economic growth of the nation were higher (or lower)?</p>
          <p>If higher or lower growth is assumed in
            such factors as population, the labor force, and productivity, there would be differences
            in industrial output, inflation rates and interest- rate levels. Assuming a range of
            annual GDP growth between 1996 and 2020 from 1.3 to 2.4 percent, compared to 1.9 percent
            in the Reference Case, total U.S. energy consumption would be lower/higher in 2010 by
            about 2.2 quadrillion Btu. (A quadrillion Btu is equivalent to consuming about 500,000
            barrels of oil per day for one year). To meet the same level of carbon reductions with
            higher (or lower) energy consumption, the &quot;carbon price&quot; would also be higher
            (or lower)--as shown on the adjoining graph. With a higher carbon price, less coal and
            more natural gas, renewables, and nuclear power are used.</p>
          <p><strong>Suppose . . .</strong> technology
            advanced more rapidly as a result of increased national emphasis on research and
            development (or suppose--technology choices stayed as they were in 1998)?</p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">The technology assumptions in the main
            cases in the EIA report reflect expert engineering opinion of likely technological
            advances--i.e., they are not technologically pessimistic. Nevertheless, to analyze the
            effects of even more advanced technology, assumptions were developed by energy technology
            experts for the end-use and generation sectors, considering possibilities based on
            increased Research and Development. This could mean earlier introduction of products and
            processes, lower costs, and higher efficiencies than assumed in the Reference Case. It was
            also assumed that technology for extracting and storing carbon emissions from coal and
            natural gas-fired electric generators might become available. A &quot;low tech&quot;
            sensitivity assumes all future choices are made from today's technology.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">The range of energy consumption differences
            was similar to the GDP growth sensitivity. Higher technology lowers energy consumption in
            2010 by 2.1 quadrillion Btu; freezing technological progress forces consumption to grow by
            an extra 1.5 quadrillion Btu. The related graph compares carbon price changes. In the
            residential and commercial sectors, lower carbon prices encourage higher consumption and
            balance the effect of advanced technology. Efficiency improvements and lower carbon prices
            allow coal use in generation to be about 40 percent higher in 2010. With low technology,
            converse trends prevail; more natural gas, nuclear energy, and renewables are needed to
            meet carbon reduction targets. The industrial and transportation sectors are more
            sensitive to technology changes than to price changes.</font></p>
          <p><strong>Suppose . . . </strong>building of
            nuclear power plants resumed in this country?</p>
          <p><font face="Arial"  size="2">Because new nuclear plants did not compete
            economically with fossil and renewable plants in the 1990+9% Case, this sensitivity was
            analyzed against 1990-3% Case (with a carbon price of $294 in 2010). Some of the extra
            costs assumed for &quot;first of a kind&quot; advanced-design plants were also relaxed.
            Under these conditions, 1 to 2 new 600- megawatt nuclear plants would be added by 2010;
            and 2020 could see about 68 new plants. Because most would start up after the 2008-2012
            period, carbon prices in 2010 would be relatively unchanged. By 2020, however, the 1990-3%
            Case carbon price of $240 per metric ton would be reduced to $199. Because of the lower
            carbon price in this sensitivity, all sectors have higher energy consumption.</font></p>
