<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">From December 1 through 11,
            1997, more than 160 nations met in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate binding limitations on
            greenhouse gases for the developed nations, pursuant to the objectives of the Framework
            Convention on Climate Change of 1992. The outcome of the meeting was the Kyoto Protocol,
            in which the developed nations agreed to limit their greenhouse gas emissions, relative to
            the levels emitted in 1990. The United States agreed to reduce emissions from 1990 levels
            by 7 percent during the period 2008 to 2012. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The analysis in this report
            was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of
            Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration
            (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, &#147;focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the
            economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,&#148; as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The
            Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions
            in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic
            growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible
            construction of new nuclear power plants. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The energy projections and
            analysis in this report were conducted using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS),
            an energy-economy model of U.S. energy markets designed, developed, and maintained by EIA.
            NEMS is used each year to provide the projections in the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO). In
            its second letter, in Appendix D, the Committee requested that the analysis use the same
            general methodologies and assumptions underlying the Annual Energy Outlook 1998 (AEO98),
            published in December 1997; however, some minor modifications were made to allow greater
            flexibility in NEMS in response to higher energy prices and to incorporate some
            methodologies that were formerly represented offline. These differences are outlined in
            Appendix A. The macroeconomic analysis used the Data Resources, Inc. (DRI) Macroeconomic
            Model of the U.S. Economy, which is also used for the economic analysis in the AEO. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Chapter 
            1 of this report provides background discussion of the Kyoto Protocol 
            and the framework and methodology of the analysis. Chapter 2 summarizes 
            the energy market results from the various carbon reduction cases. 
            Chapters 3, 4, and 5 analyze in more detail the issues and results 
            for the end-use demand sectors, the electricity generation sector, 
            and the fossil fuel supply markets, respectively. Chapter 6 provides 
            the results of EIA's analysis of the macroeconomic impacts of carbon 
            reduction under different monetary and fiscal policy assumptions. 
            Chapter 7 compares the results of this study with those from other 
            studies of the costs of carbon reduction, with accompanying tables 
            in Appendix C. Appendix B includes the detailed energy market results 
            from the carbon reduction cases. </font></p>
