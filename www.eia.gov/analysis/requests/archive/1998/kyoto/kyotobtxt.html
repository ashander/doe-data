<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p><font face="Arial" size="6"><sub>T</sub></font><font face="Arial" size="2">he Kyoto Protocol, negotiated by more than 160 nations in
            December 1997, aims to reduce net emissions of certain greenhouse gases (primarily carbon
            dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)). Each of the participating developed countries must decide how
            to meet its respective reduction goal during a five-year period (2008-2012); but specific
            ground rules remain to be worked out at future negotiating sessions. The next meeting is
            in Buenos Aires (November 1998).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a study entitled <em>Impacts of the
            Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets and Economic Activity</em>, the Energy Information
            Administration (EIA), an independent statistical and analytical agency in the U.S.
            Department of Energy, has projected that meeting the U.S. targets under the Protocol will
            call for significant market adjustments:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will
              result in between 18 and 77 percent less coal use than projected in the EIA Reference Case
              in 2010, particularly affecting electricity generation, and between 2 and 13 percent less
              petroleum use, mainly affecting transportation.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Energy consumers will need to use between 2
              and 12 percent more natural gas in 2010 and between 2 and 16 percent more renewable
              energy, and extend the operating life of existing nuclear units.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To achieve these ends via market-based
              means, average delivered energy costs (in inflation-adjusted 1996 dollars) must be between
              17 and 83 percent higher than projected in 2010.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The amount prices must rise is uncertain.
              Accounting procedures and international trading rules for greenhouse gases are not
              finalized. Forecasting technological change and public response to it under various
              pricing scenarios is an inexact science. The more stringent the need for domestic emission
              reductions, however, the more costly the adjustment process will be.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA undertook this study in response to a
            request by the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Science that
            it analyze impacts of the Protocol (which the President has not yet submitted to the U.S.
            Senate for ratification) on U.S. energy use, prices, and the general economy in the
            2008-2012 time frame. That is when this country is supposed to reach an average level of
            net greenhouse gas emissions 7 percent lower than they were in 1990--having shown
            demonstrable progress toward that goal by 2005. At the Committee's request, EIA assumed
            that actions begin in 2005.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA was asked to do the study for several
            reasons. More than 80 percent of the human-originated greenhouse gas emissions are
            energy-related. EIA's National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) is perhaps the most complete,
            
            integrated, regional computer model available to simulate all elements of U.S. energy
            supply and demand in the context of the full U.S. macroeconomy. NEMS presents year-by-year
            projections over a 20-year horizon, accounting for capital stock turnover and the
            availability and penetration of specific energy-consuming technologies. Its annual
            &quot;Reference Case&quot; assumes no change from existing laws and regulations, and so it
            provides a base from which to evaluate policy options or alternative assumptions.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA analyzed six cases to investigate the
            uncertain range of impacts which could result from the Kyoto Protocol. Differences among
            the cases analyzed arise from three facts: 1) The Protocol gives credit for &quot;CO<sub>2</sub>-
            equivalent&quot; reductions in five gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>--methane, nitrous
            oxide, and three synthetic gases--as well as for certain actions that take carbon out of
            the atmosphere (such as preserving or extending forests); 2) participating developed
            countries are allowed to sell excess &quot;permits&quot; (e.g., because of economic
            problems since 1990 in the participating countries of the former Soviet Union, they may
            have about 165 million metric tons of carbon permits easily available); and 3) support for
            effective programs in other countries can earn permits. Details of this last process
            (called &quot;Joint Implementation&quot; among developed countries and the &quot;Clean
            Development Mechanism,&quot; or CDM, for developing countries) are unsettled.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA's six cases cover a range of reductions
            in energy-linked carbon emissions from an annual average of 122 million metric tons below
            the expected baseline emissions (1990+24% Case) to 542 million metric tons (1990-7% Case)
            in 2008-2012. In the 1990+24% Case, domestic actions may furnish about one-fifth of all
            reductions, with the rest coming from international activities (including trading),
            offsets of other gases, and carbon sinks in the U.S., while the 1990+9% Case assumes that
            nearly 60 percent of the reductions result from such domestic initiatives as
            fuel-switching, improved technology, and cutbacks in energy use. EIA did not separately
            calculate the contributions of international activities, offsets or sinks for any case.
            The 1990-3% Case assumes all reductions are from domestic actions, with a 4 percentage
            point contribution from sinks and offsets from other gases. In the 1990-7% case, all
            reductions must come from domestic energy-related reductions.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Kyoto Protocol does not specify targets
            for greenhouse gases after the period 2008-2012. At the Committee's request, EIA held the
            target for energy-related carbon emissions in the commitment period constant to 2020, the
            end of the forecast horizon. Targets following the 2008-2012 period will be a topic at
            future negotiating sessions.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To reduce carbon emissions,
            EIA assumes that a &quot;carbon price&quot; is added to the price of delivered energy
            fuels based on their carbon content. For example, coal prices rise more than petroleum and
            natural gas prices; and the cost of generating electricity from non-carbon-emitting
            nuclear and renewable fuels is not increased due to the carbon price. Although electricity
            does not have the carbon price directly added to it, its price is increased due to the
            higher cost of fossil fuels used for generation.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The price increases encourage a reduction
            in the use of energy services (heating, lighting, and travel, for example), the adoption
            of more energy-efficient equipment, and a shift to less carbon-intensive fuels. The carbon
            
            price reflects the amount fossil fuel prices in the U.S., adjusted for the carbon content
            of the fuel, must rise to achieve the removal of the last ton of carbon emissions that
            meets the carbon reduction target in each case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In most of the cases, the
            carbon price peaks early in the 2008-2012 period, reaching between $67 and $348 per metric
            ton in 2010, and then declines as energy markets adjust and more efficient, new
            technologies become available and gradually penetrate the market. In the least stringent
            reduction cases, the increase is more gradual throughout the period because less severe
            reductions need to be made. Looking at average carbon prices over the commitment period
            2008 to 2012 shows how the cost of compliance increases with increasingly stringent
            targets.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Differences in the cost of energy will
            affect the outlook for U.S. jobs, consumer prices, investment, technical change, and
            economic growth. Whenever use of a factor of production such as energy is restricted,
            economic performance falls for some period of time, the price of energy and other goods
            and services rises, and consumption and employment decline. Hence the various cases affect
            the national economy to varying degrees.<br />
            </font><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><br />
              <a name="energymix" id="energymix">Electricity and Coal Industries Face Major Adjustments</a></strong></font></p>
          <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="5"><sub>W</sub></font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2">ell over one-third of all primary energy consumed by
            the United States today goes into producing and delivering electricity. At the point of
            use, electricity can be highly efficient; and there are certain end uses where fuel
            substitution is not feasible. More than one-half of all U.S. electricity generated in 1997
            was produced from coal--a fuel that emits more carbon dioxide during combustion than any
            other fossil fuel. Thus, electricity production and consumption is likely to be a major
            focus in meeting Kyoto targets, accounting for between two-thirds and three-fourths of the
            domestic carbon reductions in 2010 in the various cases examined. Historically, this
            industry has responded when relative fuel prices have changed. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because coal is the most
            carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels, delivered prices for coal are affected by carbon
            prices more than other fuel prices. They are between 153 and 800 percent higher in 2010.
            The various cases studied for show prices for electricity between 20 and 86 percent higher
            in all end-use sectors, reflecting both the increased fuel costs and the incremental
            capital investments for non-coal generating capacity--either by traditional utilities or
            by non-utility generators in an increasingly restructured industry. The price rise for
            electricity is moderated somewhat by the fact that fuel is only part of the cost of
            generating electricity and that the cost of generation from renewables and nuclear power
            are unaffected by carbon prices. Neither of these fuels, however, can replace significant
            amounts of coal in the 2008-2012 timeframe. By 2020, non-hydro renewables (chiefly wind
            turbines, biomass in advanced technological applications, and to a lesser extent,
            geothermal facilities) penetrate the market in a significant way--providing as much as
            one-fifth of generation at the highest carbon prices. While hydroelectric dams have
            accounted for four-fifths of the renewable energy used for U.S. electricity production to
            date, the expansion of hydroelectric capacity is capital-intensive and is likely to meet
            with environmental objections; thus little additional hydroelectric capacity is expected.
            The bulk of the substitution for coal generation would be natural gas, because of its
            lower carbon content and the high efficiency of gas-fired combined cycle plants.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Furthermore, demand for industrial steam
            coal and metallurgical coal is also reduced because of a shift to natural gas in
            industrial boilers and a reduction in industrial output. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because domestic coal
            consumption is between 18 and 77 percent lower in 2010 in the carbon reduction cases,
            there would be ripple effects on the industry. For example, even though total coal
            production drops, the average price per ton for coal at the minemouth in 2010 is between 3
            and 28 percent higher than the Reference Case price. This is because a larger share of
            production would come from higher-cost Eastern coal mines, which tend to serve the
            remaining markets. Carbon prices raise the cost of rail transportation (involved now in
            delivering two-thirds of all coal) and make Western coal less competitive. The production
            of Western coal is discouraged further by the reduced size of the market and the reduced
            profitability of investing in new coal mines (which have been mostly in the West).</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For the past two decades or
            so, the number of coal miners in this country has been declining by nearly 6 percent per
            year, primarily as a result of improved labor productivity (especially in large Western
            surface mines). Without taking the Kyoto Protocol in consideration, the Reference Case
            already projects a further employment drop of more than 15 percent--leaving only about
            69,000 U.S. coal miners by 2010. In the carbon reduction cases, between 10,000 and 43,000
            more jobs could be lost. Some of these job losses could be offset by growth in employment
            in the natural gas and renewable industries.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While no new nuclear power plants are
            considered in these cases, extending the licenses of existing plants is projected to
            become more economical with higher carbon prices. In more stringent carbon reduction
            cases, most existing nuclear plants are operated through 2020, in contrast to the
            Reference Case outlook that projected about half of the nuclear plants would be retired by
            that time.<br />
            <br />
            Although reduced demand for electricity and improved efficiency in its generation can
            contribute to reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation, fuel-switching
            accounts for most of the reductions. In the short run, power suppliers would increase
            their use of less carbon-intensive plants, including steam plants that use oil and gas to
            heat their boilers. Much more efficient and cost-effective combined-cycle systems increase
            their share as new capacity is added.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><a name="impact" id="impact">All Sectors Need
            to Adjust; Motor Vehicles Face Main Non-Electric Impact </a></strong></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="6"><sub>E</sub></font><font face="Arial" size="2">IA assumes that carbon prices would be imposed at the point of
            consumption--raising the &quot;delivered&quot; prices of both primary fuels and
            electricity across the board. Because various fuels face different price increases (based
            on their different carbon contents), all end-use sectors will not be affected identically.
            History has shown that residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation users of
            energy react differently to price changes.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As energy costs rise, all consumers tend to
            use less. In the broadest terms, the required carbon reductions could prompt the nation to
            lower &quot;energy intensity&quot; (the quantity of energy consumed per dollar of Gross
            Domestic Product) as much as three times faster between 2005 and 2010 than in the
            Reference Case. The rate of decline slows after 2010 reaching a decline rate from 1.4 to
            1.7 percent for the 2005 to 2020 period. In the Reference Case, energy intensity declines
            at 0.9 percent per year.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In all cases, consumers have a
            price incentive to reduce their demand for energy services, to switch to lower-carbon
            energy sources, and to invest in more energy-efficient technologies. A number of more
            efficient and lower-carbon technologies for electricity generation become economically
            available as the carbon price raises fossil-fuel prices. Those who produce and sell
            electricity are likely to respond vigorously to higher fuel prices because this industry
            has long been accustomed to factoring future energy prices into investment choices; and
            competition is becoming keener because of ongoing regulatory reforms. By contrast,
            residential consumers tend to respond less to fuel prices, paying more attention to other
            factors (such as style, familiarity, convenience).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, electricity prices, which are 20
            to 86 percent higher than the reference case in 2010, are more than matched in percentage
            terms by the projected 25- to 147-percent rise in natural gas prices due to increased
            demand and the inclusion of the &quot;carbon price.&quot; Thus, in end-uses where
            electricity competes with natural gas (such as home heating), the former becomes
            relatively more attractive. Although petroleum products, on average, contain more carbon
            than does natural gas, the price of natural gas would be increased by a greater
            percentage, in part because current prices for gasoline (a major end use of petroleum)
            incorporate Federal and State taxes. Also, lower world oil demand as a result of the
            Protocol would lower crude oil prices and offset part of the &quot;carbon price&quot; on
            oil products.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As prices for any factor of production
            increase, all goods and services reflect some cost increases they otherwise would not see.
            As higher energy prices are transmitted throughout the economy, people will react in part
            by buying less of everything. To some extent, this means U.S. industry and business must
            cope with smaller product demand, so that total output falls (thus cutting back further on
            emissions). In addition, industrial consumers of energy are prompted to replace existing
            facilities and adopt more efficient technology faster (assuming investment dollars are
            available), besides switching to less carbon-intensive fuels. The net result is an
            incremental gain in energy efficiency. If demand for energy-efficient products in the U.S.
            market should coincide with the appearance of new inventions and processes, a situation
            analogous to the rapid improvements and cost reductions in computers might occur. However,
            EIA does not include &quot;breakthroughs&quot; in end-use and generating technologies that
            are not yet on the drawing board because it is unlikely that they could be developed and
            penetrate rapidly enough to be significant in the 2008-2012 time period.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Higher fuel prices reduce total residential
            demand for energy, by promoting the installation of more efficient building shells,
            heating- and cooling- units, water heaters, and other end-use technologies, which results
            in larger carbon reductions than cutting back on miscellaneous items such as computers, TV
            sets, and VCRs. While total energy use by 2010 was projected at 184 million Btu per
            household in the Reference Case, it ranges between 145 and 173 million Btu in the six
            carbon reduction cases analyzed. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Space conditioning (heating, cooling, and
            ventilation) is the most significant energy use in the commercial sector, representing the
            best opportunity for reducing carbon emissions in the future. More efficient lighting and
            office equipment also contribute to carbon reductions (along with some modifications in
            the use of computer and telecommunications equipment). Total energy use per square foot of
            commercial floorspace in 2010 (206 thousand Btu in the Reference Case) is projected across
            the cases to drop to between 148 and 192 thousand Btu. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The U.S. transportation sector represents
            the single largest target for carbon reductions apart from electricity generation, because
            the transport sector is the biggest U.S. consumer of petroleum by far. A combination of
            more efficient vehicles and less travel would be needed across all modes. Total petroleum
            consumption in the transportation sector is between 2 and 16 percent lower in 2010 than in
            the Reference Case. Because of the impact of higher energy prices on the economy, there is
            less demand for air travel and freight shipment. In addition, airline fares are higher as
            a result of higher jet fuel prices, so air travel is between 1 and 18 percent lower.
            Consumption by aircraft is between 1 and 16 percent lower and freight trucks consume 1 to
            6 percent less fuel.</font></p>

            number of vehicle-miles traveled on U.S. streets and highways, increasing the average
            miles traveled per vehicle by about 12 percent. In the Reference Case, however, this
            rising trend is projected to slow modestly--even without the addition of a &quot;carbon
            price&quot; at the gasoline pump. Baby-boomers are aging, driving age population growth is
            slowing, miles driven by women are approaching a gender-equilibrium, and there are more
            older cars on the road (which typically are not driven as much as new cars). Historically,
            increases in gasoline prices have not done much to decrease the overall steady upward
            climb in motor fuel consumption. <br />
            <br />
            Across the cases, the average price of gasoline increases by between 11 and 53 percent
            beyond the Reference Case price in 2010. In the 1990+24% Case, the average price of
            gasoline is only about 15 cents above 1996 prices in 2010 (1996 dollars). For the 1990+9%
            Case, the average price of gasoline peaks around 2008 at approximately 30 cents per gallon
            above where it was in 1996 ... and about 10 cents more than it was in 1990. In the 1990-3%
            Case, the average price of gasoline peaks at slightly more than $1.80 a gallon in 2009,
            while in the 1990-7% Case, it almost reaches $2.00 a gallon.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The addition of a &quot;carbon price&quot;
            is expected to reduce auto travel and increase the purchase of more efficient vehicles,
            reducing gasoline demand between 3 and 18 percent in 2010. Improvements in truck, auto,
            and plane efficiency are moderated by slow turnover rates. The stock of U.S. vehicles is
            so large that its average performance lags far behind advances in new car mileage.
            Increasing new car efficiency in 2010 by 1 to 6 miles per gallon above the 30.6 miles per
            gallon in the Reference Case improves the rating of the entire stock of light-duty
            vehicles by only about one mile per gallon or less.<br />
            <br />
            EIA assumed that more than 50 fuel-saving technologies would be available to makers of
            light- duty vehicles during the period examined--ranging from electronic transmission
            controls to reduced cylinder friction; but a major uncertainty is whether consumers will
            purchase fuel efficient vehicles or continue the recent trend toward light trucks and
            sports utility vehicles. Some reversal is expected, particularly when the carbon price is
            relatively high. For example, in the 1990+9% case, the subcompact share of new car sales
            in 2010 is 19 percent compared to 12 percent in the Reference Case, reducing sales of
            compact, midsize, and large vehicles by 2 percentage points each. The annual increase in
            average horsepower ratings in the 1990+9% Case is about half that of the Reference Case. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Reference Case foresaw sales of about
            1.8 million alternative-fuel vehicles by 2010, but this number would not be affected much
            by imposition of a carbon price. While AFV's use less fuel than autos with gasoline
            engines, they are generally more expensive overall due to their higher vehicle prices.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="6"><sub>T</sub></font><font face="Arial" size="2">he industrial sector includes agriculture, mining, construction
            and manufacturing. Energy has represented a relatively small fraction of total production
            
            costs in most industries (ranging from less than 2 percent for the food industry to as
            much as 30 percent of production costs annually for the cement industry.) Consequently,
            the price of energy has not played a dominant role in recent years in improving industrial
            energy efficiency.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">U.S. energy intensity (energy input per
            dollar GDP output) has been influenced by two factors in the U.S. economy. First,
            structural shifts have occurred where the mix of goods and services has shifted away from
            the production of energy intensive goods (e.g.,iron and steel) and toward services (e.g.,
            telecommunications, entertainment). Second, technological improvements (e.g., continuous
            casting and electric arc furnaces) have impacted industrial efficiency. For more than a
            quarter century, the gradual migration of heavy industry and primary metals abroad, growth
            in the U.S. service sector and technological progress have combined to reduce U.S. energy
            intensity by about 1.4 percent annually. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Reference Case projection embodies
            considerable improvement in energy intensity. Just as lower real prices for oil, gas, and
            electricity during the late 1980s lowered incentives for energy conservation, the higher
            prices projected in connection with meeting the Kyoto carbon emission reduction goals
            result in less energy consumed for each constant dollar of output produced. This analysis
            projects a replay of the early 1980s, when the cost of both energy and capital inputs were
            rising. Across the cases, about two-thirds of the projected reduction in industrial energy
            intensity is attributable to the structural effect (change in the mix of goods and
            services); the remaining one-third to increased energy efficiency.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the carbon reduction cases, relative to
            the Reference Case in 2010, total carbon emissions from the industrial sector are between
            7 and 28 percent lower. Part of this is due to lower U.S. industrial production because
            higher energy prices lower domestic demand and make U.S. exports relatively more
            expensive. In addition, industrial consumers are likely to replace existing capacity
            somewhat faster, invest in more efficient technology, and switch to less carbon-intensive
            fuels.<strong> </strong></font></p>

            lower total demand in the two sectors by between 7 and 25 percent in 2010.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Periods of increasing energy prices appear
            to have had little impact on commercial energy demand, as seen by comparing the price
            increases in the 1970s with the change in demand. Energy prices are only one factor in
            choices for buildings, appliances, and equipment in these sectors. How consumers react to
            higher prices by reducing the demand for energy services--less heating and cooling,
            reduced lighting, etc.--will be a major factor in lowering energy demand.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Technology improvements could

            is the most intensive use of energy in buildings, but the penetration of more efficient
            equipment is slowed by the gradual pace of stock turnover. Improved lighting technologies

            each fuel used in the United States is projected to change from that of the Reference
            Case. Because of the higher relative carbon content of coal and petroleum products, those
            two energy sources would be used less--placing more reliance on natural gas and renewable
            energy, and slowing the decline in nuclear power. Although petroleum use declines relative
            to the Reference Case in absolute terms, its percentage-share increases slightly because
            total energy demand is lower in the carbon reduction cases. Most petroleum is used in the
            
            transportation sector--where there are limited economic options for fuel substitution. As
            noted earlier, domestic coal consumption declines substantially, with most of the
            reduction coming in electricity generation.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because of lower demand for petroleum in
            the United States and other developed countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas
            emissions, world oil prices in 2010 would be about 4 to 16 percent lower than they would
            have been without the effect of any &quot;carbon price.&quot; At the same time, U.S.
            dependence on imported petroleum by 2010 would be lessened--from about 59 percent of all
            petroleum consumption in the Reference Case to as much as 53 percent. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More use of natural gas in electric
            generation is offset only partly by reductions from the end-use sectors. Although carbon
            emissions from burning natural gas are lower than from coal or petroleum, they are not
            zero. Later in the forecast period, natural gas starts to face stiffer competition from
            increasingly economic non-hydro renewables and, particularly in the more stringent carbon
            reduction cases, from refurbished existing nuclear power units. As a result, by 2020,
            natural gas use is highest in the 1990+9% Case.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Higher demand forces up the
            average wellhead price of gas, relative to the Reference Case--moderately by 2010 ($2.78
            per thousand cubic feet for the 1990+9% Case, vs. $2.33 for the Reference Case) but
            considerably by 2020 ($3.71 vs. $2.62). Although the natural gas industry will be tested
            in meeting levels of production that may be required, sufficient resources are available.
            There is historic precedent for the necessary increases in drilling and pipeline capacity,
            but appropriate market incentives and careful planning will be needed.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most of the increase in renewable energy
            sources is likely to occur in electricity generation, primarily with additions to wind
            energy systems and an increase in the use of biomass (wood, switch grass, and refuse); but
            the overall renewable contribution by 2008-2012 will remain small compared to traditional
            sources. If the market penetration of additional renewable technologies is enhanced by
            carbon pricing, however, the renewables' share of generation will continue to increase
            through 2020.</font></p>

            Domestic Product (GDP), it is a crucial factor in virtually all the goods and services we
            produce and consume. The effects of alternative carbon scenarios can be expressed in terms
            of their impacts on the economy as a whole (e.g., GDP, capital investment, prevailing
            interest rates, inflation rates) as well as their impacts on individual families and
            enterprises (e.g., increased expenditures on energy, disposable income). </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When energy costs rise, other factors of
            production--including labor and capital--become relatively less expensive. Energy price
            increases encourage adjustments in which labor and capital are substituted for more
            expensive energy to the extent practicable. In the process however, some economic
            potential is lost. This reduces the &quot;potential&quot; GDP for the Nation. EIA
            calculates that such losses would range from $13 billion to $72 billion in 2010 (1992
            dollars). In an economy today of over $7 trillion, which is expected to grow to over $9.4
            trillion (1992 dollars) in 2010, the percentage loss in output ranges from 0.1 percent to
            0.8 percent. In this context, the economy continues to grow, but at a slower rate.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because it takes time to adjust to a new
            set of factor-costs, however, there are, in addition to losses in potential GDP,
            transitional costs--which probably cannot be avoided entirely. Such short-run costs arise
            whenever price increases disrupt capital or employment markets. The transitional costs are
            very uncertain, but possibly very significant. They impact the &quot;actual&quot; GDP.
            Hence, the actual GDP losses are greater than the &quot;potential&quot; losses. The
            transitional costs can be softened to the extent that price changes are anticipated and
            appropriate compensatory adjustments can be made to Federal monetary and fiscal policies. <br />
            <br />
            This analysis assumes a carbon-permit trading system is introduced in the form of an
            auction run by the Federal Government (to focus on the most economically efficient means
            of reducing carbon emissions). The domestic auction would produce substantial revenue.
            This study assumes that the revenues would be recycled back into the economy to bolster
            disposable income and encourage both consumption and investment, counteracting the adverse
            short-term effects on the economy associated with higher energy prices and speeding the
            transition to equilibrium. Taking money out of the economy through a carbon price and then
            returning it encourages a shift in priorities that accomplishes the goal of achieving a
            carbon emissions reduction while moderating the impacts on the economy. It modifies the
            national energy mix and makes the overall economy less energy-intensive, while partly
            compensating consumers and business for the loss in income resulting from higher energy
            prices. EIA evaluates two illustrative recycling cases: one providing rebates via
            reductions in the personal income tax, and the other through the social security tax. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA projects the loss in actual GDP in 2010
            to range between $61 billion and $183 billion if revenues are recycled via a reduction in
            social security taxes, and between $96 billion and $397 billion if they are recycled via a
            reduction in personal income taxes (1992 dollars). Again, the economy grows even during
            the period of adjustment but does not reach the levels of growth in potential GDP.
            Although there is a definite slowing of economic growth during the transition period,
            actual GDP returns to its potential path, so the effects on the economy are almost totally
            muted over the longer term.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The total cost to the economy can be
            estimated as the loss in actual GDP (the loss in potential GDP plus the macroeconomic
            adjustment cost) plus the purchase of international permits. It is assumed that the U.S.
            will purchase international permits at the marginal abatement cost in the U.S., i.e., the
            domestic carbon price. Total costs range from an average annual level for the period 2008
            to 2012 of $77 billion to $338 billion 1992 dollars depending on the carbon reduction case
            and how funds are recycled back to the economy.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As energy prices rise in the United States,
            downstream prices for all goods and services are affected. A rule of thumb for the year
            2010 is that each 10-percent increase in the level of aggregate energy prices may lead to
            a 1.5- percent increase in producer prices and a 0.7- percent increase in consumer prices.
            Final prices for goods and services in the 1990+9% case, as shown by the CPI, are
            approximately 3.5 percent higher than the Reference Case by 2010 if carbon permit revenues
            are recycled through a personal income tax rebate, and 2.0 percent higher if revenues are
            recycled through a social security tax rebate.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Throughout these cases, the role of
            monetary policy is critical. Higher energy prices place upward pressure on interest rates.
            Based on past behavior of the Federal Reserve Board, it is assumed that they will adjust
            interest rates to moderate the impact on the economy and return it to its long-run path.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="6"><sub>T</sub></font><font face="Arial" size="2">he House Science Committee asked EIA to determine how sensitive
            the results of its analysis might be to changes in three basic assumptions made for the
            Reference Case. These were analyzed against the 1990+9% Case, except for the changes in
            nuclear power assumptions. The changes can be framed as three questions.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#B7005B"><strong>Suppose . . . </strong>underlying
            economic growth of the nation were higher (or lower)?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If higher or lower growth is assumed in
            such factors as population, the labor force, and productivity, there would be differences
            in industrial output, inflation rates and interest- rate levels. Assuming a range of
            annual GDP growth between 1996 and 2020 from 1.3 to 2.4 percent, compared to 1.9 percent
            in the Reference Case, total U.S. energy consumption would be lower/higher in 2010 by
            about 2.2 quadrillion Btu. (A quadrillion Btu is equivalent to consuming about 500,000
            barrels of oil per day for one year). To meet the same level of carbon reductions with
            higher (or lower) energy consumption, the &quot;carbon price&quot; would also be higher
            (or lower)--as shown on the adjoining graph. With a higher carbon price, less coal and
            more natural gas, renewables, and nuclear power are used.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#B7005B"><strong>Suppose . . .</strong> technology
            advanced more rapidly as a result of increased national emphasis on research and
            development (or suppose--technology choices stayed as they were in 1998)?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The technology assumptions in the main
            cases in the EIA report reflect expert engineering opinion of likely technological
            advances--i.e., they are not technologically pessimistic. Nevertheless, to analyze the
            effects of even more advanced technology, assumptions were developed by energy technology
            experts for the end-use and generation sectors, considering possibilities based on
            increased Research and Development. This could mean earlier introduction of products and
            processes, lower costs, and higher efficiencies than assumed in the Reference Case. It was
            also assumed that technology for extracting and storing carbon emissions from coal and
            natural gas-fired electric generators might become available. A &quot;low tech&quot;
            sensitivity assumes all future choices are made from today's technology.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The range of energy consumption differences
            was similar to the GDP growth sensitivity. Higher technology lowers energy consumption in
            2010 by 2.1 quadrillion Btu; freezing technological progress forces consumption to grow by
            an extra 1.5 quadrillion Btu. The related graph compares carbon price changes. In the
            residential and commercial sectors, lower carbon prices encourage higher consumption and
            balance the effect of advanced technology. Efficiency improvements and lower carbon prices
            allow coal use in generation to be about 40 percent higher in 2010. With low technology,
            converse trends prevail; more natural gas, nuclear energy, and renewables are needed to
            meet carbon reduction targets. The industrial and transportation sectors are more
            sensitive to technology changes than to price changes.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#B7005B"><strong>Suppose . . . </strong>building of
            nuclear power plants resumed in this country?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because new nuclear plants did not compete
            economically with fossil and renewable plants in the 1990+9% Case, this sensitivity was
            analyzed against 1990-3% Case (with a carbon price of $294 in 2010). Some of the extra
            costs assumed for &quot;first of a kind&quot; advanced-design plants were also relaxed.
            Under these conditions, 1 to 2 new 600- megawatt nuclear plants would be added by 2010;
            and 2020 could see about 68 new plants. Because most would start up after the 2008-2012
            period, carbon prices in 2010 would be relatively unchanged. By 2020, however, the 1990-3%
            Case carbon price of $240 per metric ton would be reduced to $199. Because of the lower
            carbon price in this sensitivity, all sectors have higher energy consumption.</font></p>

                  well in advance</font></p>

                  carbon prices and their effects, from various sources, are outlined in Chapter 7 of the
                  full report. Two cases were analyzed: the1990-7% Case in which the United States is
                  assumed to reduce carbon emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels for the period 2008-2020
                  without the benefit of sinks, offsets, international carbon permit trading, or the Clean
                  Development Mechanism (CDM); and a best estimate of the impact on U.S. energy markets if
                  sinks, offsets, and emissions trading among the participating developed nations (Annex I)
                  were allowed, but not global trading or CDM.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the United States is required to achieve
                  stabilization at the 1990-7% levels without Annex I trading and no credit for sinks and
                  offsets, the estimates of carbon prices required in 2010 range from a low of $221 per
                  metric ton to $348 per metric ton, with the vast majority in the $265 to $295 per metric
                  ton range. Actual GDP losses are projected to range from $102 to $437 billion dollars in
                  2010 (1996 dollars). With Annex I trading and credits for sinks and offsets from other
                  gases, the carbon price ranges between $100 per metric ton to $175 per metric ton and the
                  loss of actual GDP ranges between $56 and $207 billion dollars in 2010. Estimates of
                  internationally purchased carbon credits by the U.S. range from 147 to 288 million metric
                  tons.</font></p></td>
