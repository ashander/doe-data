<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The impacts on fossil fuel
            suppliers of policies to limit carbon emissions will depend on how much carbon is in each
            type of fuel: the more carbon in the fuel, the more severe the impact. If the Kyoto
            Protocol carbon emissions reduction targets were imposed, the U.S. coal and oil industries
            would see lower consumption and production than in the reference case, which does not
            incorporate the Protocol, whereas the natural gas industry would expand. Natural gas wins
            out over coal and oil in the carbon reduction cases used for this analysis, because its
            carbon content per British thermal unit (Btu) is only 55 percent of that for coal and 70
            percent of that for oil. As a result of higher natural gas consumption and lower oil and
            coal consumption, carbon emissions from natural gas are projected to be higher in the
            carbon reduction cases, while emissions from oil and coal are lower. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="4" ><b>Natural Gas Industry</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Natural gas is a clean,
            economical, widely-available fuel used in more than 58 million homes and more than 60
            percent of the manufacturing plants in the United States. Almost one-quarter of the energy
            consumed in the United States comes from natural gas. Most of the natural gas consumed in
            the United States is produced domestically from wells in the central part of the Nation.
            Gas is transported from the Central United States by pipelines throughout the country and
            becomes more expensive the farther it must be shipped. Yet natural gas is generally
            cheaper than oil products, though more expensive than coal on the basis of heating values. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In 1996 the combustion of
            natural gas produced 318 million metric tons of carbon emissions in the United States,
            about one-fifth of the U.S. total. The industrial sector was responsible for the biggest
            share of those emissions, about 45 percent, followed by residential, commercial, and
            electricity generation in order of magnitude. Twelve years from now, if no carbon
            reduction measures are put in place, emissions from natural gas combustion are expected to
            be about 100 million metric tons higher than they were in 1996. Even though the projected
            emissions are higher in 2010, the natural gas share of total emissions increases only
            slightly from 1996. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Natural gas consumption,
            production, imports, and prices are all expected to rise in the reference case. Natural
            
            gas consumption increases more rapidly than consumption of any other major fuel in the
            reference case from 1996 to 2010. Natural gas use increases in all sectors, but
            consumption by electricity generators more than doubles to take advantage of the high
            efficiencies of combined-cycle units and the low capital costs of combustion turbines. By
            2010 the generating capability of combined-cycle plants increases more than sixfold, and
            the generating capability of combustion turbines more than doubles. More than four-fifths
            of the new consumption is supplied by increased domestic production. The remainder comes
            from increased imports, primarily from Canada. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Two-thirds of the production
            increase between 1996 and 2010 is expected to come from onshore resources in the lower 48
            States; the rest is expected to come from Alaska and lower 48 offshore resources. More
            production comes from onshore lower 48 resources, because roughly 75 percent of current
            proved reserves are located onshore, and continued technology improvements make
            development of the vast onshore unconventional resources more economical. Wellhead prices
            rise moderately in the reference case through 2010, reflecting increased consumption and
            its impact on resources, as each type of production progresses from larger, more
            profitable fields to smaller, less economical ones. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Policies designed to reduce
            carbon emissions would boost natural gas consumption, production, imports, and prices,
            principally because natural gas consumption would displace coal consumption in the
            electricity supply sector. In response, gas production and imports would increase, pushing
            up prices. In the 3-percent-below-1990 (1990-3%) case, for example, the natural gas share
            of the U.S. energy market is projected to increase from 24 percent in 1996 to 35 percent
            in 2010, compared with an increase of only 2 percentage points in the reference case.
            Following the imposition of a carbon price, higher prices for natural gas eventually would
            bring gas into competition with conservation (i.e., demand reduction) and renewable fuels,
            slowing the growth of gas consumption and prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Natural Gas Consumption</b> </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Natural gas plays a key role
            in the transition to lower carbon emissions, because it allows fuel users to consume the
            same number of Btu, while emitting less carbon. Thus, one strategy for fuel users seeking
            to quickly reduce coal use is to increase gas use. Natural gas consumption is expected to
            rise more rapidly in all the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, driven by
            rising consumption in the electricity supply sector (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph1.pdf">Figure 93</a>).
            Although electricity generators would produce less electricity in the carbon reduction
            cases than in the reference case, they would consume more natural gas, because relatively
            high-carbon coal would be replaced with relatively low-carbon natural gas. In the
            9-percent-above-1990 (1990+9%) case, where the projected carbon price is relatively low,
            natural gas steadily replaces coal; but in the 1990-3% case, with a higher carbon price,
            renewable sources of generation begin to compete successfully with natural gas after 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The projections for natural
            gas use in the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors are almost
            always lower in the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, because those
            sectors have significantly less opportunity to switch from higher-carbon fuels to
            lower-carbon natural gas. In the residential and commercial sectors there is very little
            coal use, and most oil consumption occurs in areas where natural gas pipelines are
            limited. In the industrial sector, under the best circumstances, gas consumption can only
            hold its own in the carbon reduction cases, as some boilers switch from coal to gas. In
            the transportation sector gas has difficulty competing because of the limited range of
            compressed natural gas vehicles. As a result, consumption of natural gas in these sectors
            is reduced from the reference case levels because of higher natural gas prices, which lead
            to conservation and the penetration of more efficient technologies. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The pattern of total gas
            consumption differs in the carbon reduction cases, depending on the carbon price (Figure
            93). Higher carbon prices, as in the 1990-3% case, lead to a quick surge in natural gas
            consumption when the carbon price takes effect in 2005 and gas gains an advantage over
            coal for electricity generation. Later in the forecast the increase in gas consumption in
            the 1990-3% case is moderated, as renewables on the supply side and energy efficiency
            gains on the demand side begin to cut into the natural gas market. Moderate carbon prices
            in the 1990+9% case result in a steadier rise in natural gas consumption, ultimately to
            higher levels in 2020 than those expected in the 1990-3% case, because natural gas prices
            are not high enough to induce significant levels of conservation or competition from
            renewables. Low carbon prices in the 24-percent-above-1990 (1990+24%) case lead to an even
            slower, 1.8 percent annual rise in consumption, from 1996 to 2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >From 1950 to the late 1980s,
            electricity generators were third among the major users of natural gas, after industrial
            and residential users. In the late 1980s, they began to slip into fourth position, after
            commercial users, where they are today. When oil and coal prices were declining in the
            late 1980s, gas prices were fairly constant. As a result, oil and coal took a larger share
            of the growing electricity generation market while gas use remained flat. Gas consumption
            continued to grow in the commercial sector, however, eventually surpassing electricity
            sector consumption. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the future, supply to
            electric generators is expected to become more important to the gas industry. In the
            reference, 1990+24%, and 14-percent-above-1990 (1990+14%) cases, electricity generators
            become the second largest consumers of natural gas, behind the industrial sector, by 2010.
            In the higher priced carbon reduction cases, they become the largest consumers of natural
            gas by 2010. Consumption of natural gas for electricity generation is projected to reach
            12.2 trillion cubic feet in 2010 in the 1990-3% case, more than 5 trillion cubic feet
            higher than in the reference case and more than four times the 1996 level (Figure 93).
            Electricity generators can be expected to take a greater interest in natural gas pipeline
            
            capacity expansion by investing in some projects or by making long-term contracts.
            Pressure to merge gas and electricity companies could mount as the advantage of
            arbitraging the two markets becomes apparent. Electricity generators might also increase
            their direct ownership of natural gas resources or make long-term contracts with producers
            in efforts to reduce price volatility. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3" ><b>Natural Gas
            Production</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In most of the carbon
            reduction cases examined here, natural gas production, in response to higher consumption
            and prices, is higher than it is in the reference case projections throughout the forecast
            period. Production patterns across the cases are similar to the consumption pattern: the
            1990-3% case shows a sharper rise immediately after 2005, whereas the 1990+9% case shows a
            steadier but ultimately higher rise after 2011, and the 1990+24% case is slightly above
            the reference case. In 2010, production is projected to be 26.2 trillion cubic feet in the
            1990-3% case, 25.9 trillion cubic feet in the 1990+9% case, and 24.1 trillion cubic feet
            in the 1990+24% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The imposition of carbon
            reduction targets in 2005 causes a sharp increase in natural gas production, due largely
            to increased consumption by electricity generators. The largest production increase is
            projected in the 7-percent-below-1990 (1990-7%) case (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph1.pdf">Figure 94</a>),
            because competing coal prices rise faster than in any other case. The projected increase
            in natural gas production between 2005 and 2006 is 1.75 trillion cubic feet in the 1990-7%
            case, compared with only 0.39 trillion cubic feet in the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Historically, the largest
            1-year increase in gas production was 1.37 trillion cubic feet between 1983 and 1984
            (Figure 94). However, in 1984 production was recovering to levels that already had been
            reached in 1982, and production in both 1983 and 1985 was down from the previous year. In
            contrast, the levels expected in 2005-2007&#151;while not unlikely&#151;have never before
            been reached. Increasing natural gas consumption during the initial phases of a carbon
            emissions reduction program may be the biggest challenge facing the oil and gas industry,
            and careful planning will be required. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Sufficient natural gas
            resources are available, however, and infrastructure can be made available, if the price
            is right. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >All the carbon reduction cases
            would require more natural gas wells to be drilled to reach the expected higher production
            levels. In 1996 about 9,100 successful gas wells were drilled. In the reference case, some
            12,000 are expected by 2010. The largest annual increase required in any of the carbon
            reduction cases is less than 700 wells. A 700-well increase could easily be handled by the
            drilling industry, considering that the number of successful gas wells increased by more
            than 2,000 from 1996 to 1997, when prices increased from $1.55 in 1995 to $2.23 in 1997.
            The stimulating effect of prices on drilling can also be seen in the 1990-3% case, which
            projects the highest number of gas wells in 2010, because gas wellhead prices are only a
            few cents below the 1990-7% case and oil wellhead prices are higher. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Although the number of
            available drilling rigs has been declining since 1982, price increases are a powerful
            incentive for increased drilling and the purchase of new drilling equipment. The number of
            available drilling rigs increased by almost 14 percent annually between 1974 and
            1982&#151;from 1,767 to 5,644&#151;as natural gas prices more than quadrupled in real
            terms.<a href="fnote2.html#71"><sup>71</sup></a> About 1,600 drilling rigs were available
            in the United States in 1996. To support the increased drilling in the carbon reduction
            cases, the number of available drilling rigs is also expected to rise, especially between
            2005 and 2010, when 2-percent increases in rig construction are projected in some years.
            Given the historical response to rising prices, rig availability is unlikely to be a
            problem in the carbon reduction cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Increased drilling produces
            higher reserves in the carbon reduction cases than the reference case, but not until after
            2010. Initially, increased consumption of natural gas depresses reserves in the carbon
            reduction cases, compared with the reference case projection, because production exceeds
            reserve additions. After 2010, however, natural gas reserves in the carbon reduction cases
            begin to exceed reserves in the reference case, pulled up by the higher prices. In all the
            cases, reserves peak late in the forecast and then begin to decline. The peak year for
            reserves is important, because a decline in reserves indicates that production is
            exceeding reserve additions. When that happens, wellhead prices tend to rise because of
            depletion effects. Reserves peak later in the higher carbon price cases, as higher
            wellhead prices sustain drilling and discoveries over a longer period. In the 1990-3% and
            1990+9% cases, reserves peak in 2018, compared with 2013 in the reference case and
            1990+24% case. The highest peak is projected in the 1990-7% case, at 195.5 trillion cubic
            feet of reserves in 2018. Projections of reserve levels depend on the assumed levels of
            natural gas resources and, as such, are highly uncertain, particularly in the offshore
            regions of the lower 48 States. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In general, increased reserves
            indicate that a mineral industry is well prepared to serve its customers; however,
            reserves must be placed in the context of production to gauge their real adequacy.
            Reserve-to-production (RP) ratios provide a measure of the adequacy of reserves. In this
            analysis, RP ratios generally are projected to fall faster in the carbon reduction cases
            than in the reference case, because production exceeds replacement of reserves (Figure
            95). The path of RP ratios over the forecast is heavily influenced by the production path.
            When production increases steeply in the 1990-3% case the RP ratio drops steeply, whereas
            in the 1990+24% case the RP ratio drops more steadily to lower ultimate levels. In 1996,
            the RP ratio for natural gas was 8.3. In the reference case, it is projected to fall to
            6.4 in 2020. In the 1990+24% case, the RP ratio in 2020 is slightly lower than in the
            reference case and is at the lowest level of any year in the forecast. In the 1990-3% and
            1990+9% cases, the RP ratio in 2020 exceeds the reference case projection (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph1.pdf">Figure 95</a>). Thus, when a higher carbon price is projected, the
            adequacy of natural gas reserves improves relative to that projected in the reference
            case, because higher gas prices are expected to lead to more reserve additions. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Most types of natural gas
            production are projected to be higher in the carbon reduction cases than in the reference
            case, with the exception of associated-dissolved (AD) and Alaskan gas. AD gas production
            is a function of oil production, which is expected to be lower in the carbon reduction
            cases than in the reference case&nbsp;(see the &#148;Oil Production&#148; section below).
            While increasing in all cases, Alaska&#146;s production of natural gas is expected to be
            lower in the carbon reduction cases, because the market for Alaskan gas is limited mostly
            to the State. Electricity generators in Alaska are already more heavily dependent on
            natural gas than coal, and their opportunities to switch from coal to gas are limited. So,
            electricity generators reduce gas consumption. Although not included in this analysis, the
            market for Alaskan natural gas could grow through increased exportation of liquefied
            natural gas, manufacturing of liquids from natural gas (the Fischer-Tropsch process),
            increased industrial manufacturing, or methanol manufacturing. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Employment in the oil and gas
            industries generally has fallen in recent years, as oil production has declined and
            productivity has increased. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment
            in the oil and gas extraction industries declined from 400,000 employees in 1988 to
            322,000 in 1996, a reduction of approximately 20 percent. Over the same period, total oil
            and gas production dropped from 34.9 quadrillion Btu to 33.0 quadrillion Btu, a reduction
            of only 5 percent. Rising productivity accelerated the decline in employment relative to
            the decline in production. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the reference case, higher
            natural gas production is projected to more than offset lower oil production, leading to a
            total oil and gas production level of 38.6 quadrillion per year Btu by 2020. Although
            employment in the oil and gas industries is not included in the projections for this
            analysis, it is reasonable to expect that the increase in production would at least reduce
            the rate of decline in employment. In the 1990+9% case, total oil and gas production in
            2020 is projected to be 2.1 quadrillion Btu (about 5 percent) higher than in the reference
            case, despite a reduction of 0.5 quadrillion Btu in oil production. Thus, the projection
            for the 1990+9% case implies that there would be more workers in the natural gas industry
            in 2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The patterns of U.S. natural
            gas production projected in the carbon reduction cases differ among the six onshore and
            three offshore producing regions, depending on consumption and available resources. In the
            largest producing regions, the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast onshore and Gulf Coast
            offshore, production rises throughout the forecast in the reference case, because
            significant amounts of resources are located in those regions, and technology improvements
            make more of the resources available for production in the projection
            period&#151;particularly, unconventional resources and conventional resources at depths
            greater than 10,000 feet. In the three medium-sized onshore regions, production peaks
            during the forecast in the reference case and declines as production becomes more costly.
            In the two least productive regions, the West Coast and Pacific offshore, production
            generally falls throughout the forecast, as a small resource base precludes significant
            responses to higher prices. Regional production in the carbon reduction cases is generally
            higher than in the reference case because prices are higher. In regions where production
            peaks during the forecast, production tends to peak sooner in the carbon reduction cases,
            because more gas is produced earlier. </font></p>

                  Issues</b></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Uncertainty regarding
                    estimates of the Nation&#146;s natural gas resources has always been an issue in
                    projecting production. Although this study relies on resource estimates made by the U.S.
                    Geological Survey (USGS) and Minerals Management Service (MMS), some uncertainty surrounds
                    those estimates. Although many analysts believe that the USGS estimates are too high, an
                    April 1998 study by the Gas Research Institute (GRI)<sup>a</sup> contends that the
                    industry has &#147;significantly underestimated&#148; the growth potential of existing
                    fields and should look to the Midcontinent, onshore Gulf Coast, East Texas, and San Juan
                    Basin for reserve growth. GRI has increased its reserve estimates for those areas but
                    maintains that assessing the actual amounts remains a difficult task. Uncertainty is a
                    particular problem in the offshore area (which the industry hopes will provide significant
                    supplies) because not much historical data is available for offshore production. Not all
                    of the industry&#146;s original hopes may be realized, however. For example, the sub-salt
                    area, which until recently was regarded as a promising supply source, is no longer
                    considered to be as promising. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Another concern about supply
                    availability is access to public land for drilling. Drilling moratoria have placed
                    offshore areas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, North Carolina, and California off limits,
                    and drilling is limited in some areas of the West because of concern about emissions.
                    Substantial resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)<sup>b</sup> are also
                    restricted from drilling, although the current inability to market natural gas from
                    northern Alaska renders the accessibility issue moot. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In addition to concerns about
                    supply availability, there is widespread speculation in the industry as to whether the
                    level of production that would be needed to meet the hefty increases in demand projected
                    in various carbon reduction scenarios could be achieved, given current worldwide shortages
                    of offshore rigs and skilled personnel. Virtually every available offshore rig was in use
                    throughout 1997, and capacity expansion has been limited by uncertainty surrounding the
                    actual demand for new rigs. The lead time for construction of new rigs is 2 to 3 years,
                    and costs range from $115 million for a 350-foot jack up to $325 million for a deepwater
                    semisubmersible.<sup>c</sup> Considerable training is needed to develop a workforce, and
                    many people are reluctant to enter the workforce because of its cyclical history and their
                    consequent fear of future layoffs. In addition, there are concerns about the adequacy of
                    the infrastructure to move gas from offshore drilling platforms to the shore. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >To address these
                    uncertainties, several studies are being undertaken. For example, former Secretary of
                    Energy Federico Peña commissioned the National Petroleum Council (NPC) to undertake a
                    study of whether the industry will be able to respond to meet projected demands,<sup>d</sup> and the Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA) is working on a report that will analyze
                    whether the industry can meet increased demand projections without increasing wellhead
                    prices.<sup>e</sup></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Royalty issues are also of
                    concern. The Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals Management, Robert
                    L. Armstrong, raised the issue of a possible increase in the deepwater royalty rate to
                    16.67 percent from 12.5 percent after the current &#147;royalty holiday.&#148; Although
                    the proposal has not been supported by Congress, the uncertainty about royalty relief that
                    stems from any talk about changes could place a damper on investment. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Despite the above concerns,
                    considerable investment is being made in the industry. According to Arthur Andersen&#146;s
                    10th annual &#147;U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Industry Outlook Survey,&#148; executives of most
                    U.S. exploration-and-production companies plan to increase spending in 1998.<sup>f</sup> As an example, Shell has recently announced plans to spend nearly $1 billion to develop
                    three oil-and-gas fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.<sup>g</sup></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Clearly, there are conflicting
                    opinions throughout industry as to whether steep increases in production can be achieved
                    in a timely fashion, even with significant increases in wellhead prices. In order for this
                    to happen, the industry first needs to be confident that the demand will be there, so that
                    the necessary investments in infrastructure, rigs, drilling, and manpower development can
                    be made in time. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Natural gas imports are
            projected to be higher in all the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, as
            the industry works to meet rising demands for natural gas. In 2010, net natural gas
            imports are projected to be 4.7 trillion cubic feet in the reference case and up to 5.7
            trillion cubic feet in the carbon reduction cases. Net imports&nbsp; highest in the cases
            with high carbon prices, where imports surge as the carbon prices are imposed and remain
            at higher levels than those projected in the reference case. However, by the end of the
            forecast, the highest levels of net imports are expected in the 1990-3% case, rather than
            the 1990-7% case, because consumption is projected to be higher in the 1990-3% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In most of the carbon
            reduction cases, the majority of the higher imports come from Canada in 2010, but in the
            1990-7% and 1990-3% cases at least half of the increase comes from Mexico. Even though
            Canada would be subject to its own carbon restrictions, it has a large enough resource
            base to increase both domestic consumption and exports. The Canadian Gas Potential
            Committee estimated in 1997 that the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin contained 263
            trillion cubic feet of marketable gas.<a href="fnote2.html#72"><sup>72</sup></a> In 2010
            Natural Resources Canada projects Canadian natural gas consumption at 3.6 trillion cubic
            feet, up 600 billion cubic feet from 1995.<a href="fnote2.html#73"><sup>73</sup></a> If
            carbon reduction targets were imposed, Canada&#146;s gas consumption would likely be
            higher. For example, if gas consumption in Canada were 10 percent higher in 2010 as a
            result of carbon restrictions, as projected for the United States in the most stringent
            carbon reduction cases, it would reach 4.2 trillion cubic feet in 2010. Even at that
            level, however, U.S. prices are expected to be high enough to continue the flow of imports
            from Canada. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font ><font face="Arial" size="2">In the carbon reduction
            cases, Mexico is a net exporter of natural gas to the United States in 2010, whereas it is
            a net importer in the reference case. Mexico begins to export gas to the United States in
            the carbon reduction cases in response to higher consumption and higher wellhead prices.
            Net imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) reach one-third of a trillion cubic feet
            annually in all the carbon reduction cases but do so more quickly in the cases with higher
            projected carbon prices.</font><font size="2" face="Palatino"> </font></font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Interstate natural gas
            pipeline capacity additions would need to be higher in the carbon reduction cases than
            they are in the reference case projections, but they are expected to be manageable. In the
            reference case, cumulative additional natural gas pipeline capacity crossing the 12
            regions used for this analysis are projected to increase to 52.5 trillion cubic feet of
            design capacity in 2010 from the 1996 capacity of 43.0 trillion cubic feet. The most
            significant increase is projected from 1998 to 2001, when capacity increases by 6.3
            trillion cubic feet because of increasing consumption in the Midwest and Northeast not
            because of carbon reduction policies. During the&nbsp;1998-2001 period, the Alliance
            pipeline is expected to&nbsp;come down to the Midwest from Canada, and
            the&nbsp;Maritimes/Northeast and Portland Natural Gas Transmission System pipelines are
            expected to come down from Sable Island in Canada to the northeastern United States. After
            2001, pipeline capacity is projected to increase more gradually through 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the carbon reduction cases,
            the largest 1-year increase in pipeline capacity after 2001 is seen from 2011 to 2012 in
            the 1990+9% and 1990+14% cases, when capacity increases by 1.6 trillion cubic feet. The
            capacity increases in this period are primarily out of Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma,
            through the South, to the southern coastal States in response to growing consumption. The
            largest increase soon after imposition of the carbon price is from 2006 to 2007 in the
            1990-3% case, when capacity is projected to increase by 1.4 trillion cubic feet. The
            increase is mainly from west to east, from the Texas-Oklahoma-Louisiana region to the
            Middle South. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font ><font face="Arial" size="2">Historically, the
            largest recent annual increase in pipeline capacity was 1.6 trillion cubic feet from 1991
            to 1992, partly because of the construction of four major pipelines into California from
            the Mountain States (Kern River, Mohave, El Paso, and Transwestern) and two major
            pipelines out of Canada (Great Lakes into the Midwest and Iroquois into the New York/New
            England area). In view of the historical and expected near-term increases in capacity,
            capacity expansion is not likely to be a problem in any carbon reduction scenario, as long
            as pipeline requirements are known 2 to 3 years in advance.</font><font size="2" face="Palatino"> </font></font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Natural gas prices are higher
            in the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, both at the wellhead and at the
            burner tip. At the wellhead, higher production to satisfy increased natural gas
            consumption, in the face of increasingly expensive resources, boosts prices. At the burner
            tip, adding carbon prices to resource costs could more than double some end-use prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the reference case, lower
            48 wellhead natural gas prices are projected to rise from $2.24 per thousand cubic feet in
            1996 to $2.33 in 2010 in 1996 dollars (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph1.pdf">Figure 96</a>). The 2010
            wellhead prices are more than 40 cents per thousand cubic feet or 19 and 29 percent higher
            in the 1990-3% and 1990+9% cases, which project higher consumption and the use of
            increasingly expensive resources. The highest wellhead prices in 2010 are seen in the
            1990-7% case at $3.03 per thousand cubic feet, where carbon prices are highest in 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font ><font face="Arial" size="2">The pattern of natural
            gas wellhead prices is similar to the consumption and production patterns (see above). In
            the reference case, prices rise gradually, but in the carbon reduction cases prices rise
            quickly after a carbon price is imposed in 2005. In the cases with higher projected carbon
            prices, gas prices rise more quickly, then flatten out as energy conservation on the
            demand side and renewable energy production on the supply side slow the overall rate of
            growth in natural gas consumption. When moderate carbon prices are projected, gas prices
            rise more steadily but ultimately reach higher levels</font><font size="2" face="Palatino">. </font></font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >There are three ways of
                    increasing pipeline capacity. The simplest and least expensive is to increase throughput
                    by increasing compression at compressor stations. The second is through a process called
                    &#147;looping,&#148; in which parallel pipe is laid next to existing pipe to increase
                    capacity along an existing route. The third, and most costly, is to build new pipe,
                    usually entailing additional costs for land and/or right-of-way. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Two key criteria must be met
                    in order for an expansion project even to be proposed: (1) the existence of demand must be
                    shown, and (2) the project must be proven to be financially viable. Four steps are needed
                    to bring a project to fruition: (1) an open season of 1 to 2 months during which bids for
                    the proposed capacity are solicited and received, (2) a planning stage of 3 to 5 months,
                    (3) filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for approval, with an
                    average time of 15 months (ranging from 5 to 18 months), and (4) an actual construction
                    stage, which averages 6 to 9 months. Barring unforeseen delays, capacity can be added with
                    a lead time of 2 to 3 years. Problems that can slow down the process include the filing of
                    environmental impact statements and acquiring necessary approvals, and changes in market
                    conditions (such as the changing market conditions that affected the Altamont project,
                    which was approved in 1990 but still has not been constructed). FERC has seen a
                    significant increase recently in the number of comments and protests received on proposed
                    expansion projects. Another potential problem is competition between two pipelines for
                    expansion to serve the same market, such as the recent competition to move supplies from
                    Western Alberta, Canada, into the Midwest. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Greater increases in pipeline
                    capacity than those projected in the carbon reduction cases are likely between now and
                    2000. More than 116 expansion projects have already been proposed. For the 71 projects for
                    which preliminary estimates are available, the estimated total costs exceed $11 billion.
                    In 2000 alone, $4.6 billion in expenditures is anticipated, as several major projects may
                    be completed.<sup>a</sup> The added capacity is needed to provide access to new and
                    expanding production areas, such as Canada and the deep offshore, and to accommodate
                    shifts in demand patterns, such as new demands for natural gas to replace electricity
                    generation capacity lost as a result of nuclear retirements. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Although there is speculation
                    within the industry as to whether the needed expansions can occur, two factors support an
                    optimistic outlook. The first is changes in FERC policy, which now leans more toward
                    letting the pipelines assume more risk rather than requiring firm contracts to be in place
                    before approving an expansion. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >This may work to speed up the
                    approval process. The second is projected increases in natural gas demand, independent of
                    the Kyoto Protocol. Demand growth is already anticipated to result from electric utility
                    restructuring activities in a growing number of States, retirements of nuclear facilities,
                    and measures included in the President&#146;s Climate Change Technology Initiative (a $6.3
                    billion initiative), which will proceed regardless of the fate of the Kyoto Protocol. If
                    the anticipated increases in demand do materialize, they could provide the impetus for
                    much of the capacity increase that would be needed in the event that the Kyoto Protocol is
                    ratified. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >On the other hand, financial
                    considerations are creating some uncertainty about the responsiveness of the pipeline
                    industry. A major issue is whether the economic climate for investment will continue to be
                    favorable. Pipeline owners are claiming that they currently face considerable risk because
                    of increased competition and the threat of capacity turnback. While the Natural Gas Supply
                    Association (NGSA) contends that the FERC&#146;s current policy for determining pipeline
                    returns on equity is fair and properly accounts for the risk faced by the pipeline
                    industry, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) contends that the
                    Commission&#146;s generic method artificially lowers allowed returns, and that rates
                    should be calculated on a case-by-case basis. Pipeline executives contend that the 12- to
                    13-percent average rate of return for pipelines in 1996 was far lower than the 20-percent
                    rate earned by most public companies.<sup>b</sup> In response to the industry&#146;s
                    concerns, the FERC is currently evaluating possible changes in the method used to
                    calculate pipeline returns. As even more risk is associated with the levels of expansion
                    forecast in the carbon reduction cases, a key question is, &#147;Who will assume the added
                    risk&#151;utilities that need the gas, other consumers willing to contract for gas, or the
                    pipeline companies?&#148; </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Despite the obvious
                    uncertainties, recent history shows that the industry can handle expansions of the same
                    order of magnitude as those being projected as a result of the Kyoto Protocol. Changes in
                    the pipeline industry between now and the time of the rapid capacity expansions that are
                    expected to be needed to support electricity suppliers after the enactment of carbon
                    reduction targets will be key to the industry&#146;s ability to respond. This is one of
                    the issues that the upcoming NPC study commissioned by former Secretary of Energy Federico
                    Peña will be addressing. Several other industry studies are underway to evaluate the
                    industry&#146;s ability to respond, including an INGAA study that &#147;will be looking at
                    what needs to be done for the pipeline industry&#148; to achieve a market of 30 trillion

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >On a regional basis,
            access to end-use markets heavily influences wellhead prices. Some of the lowest wellhead
            prices are seen in the Rocky Mountain region, where access to eastern markets is limited
            by pipeline constraints. This is balanced by wellhead prices in the two largest producing
            regions in this study, the Gulf Coast onshore and offshore, which have prices slightly
            above the national average in 1996. Wellhead prices are currently higher in the Northeast
            region than any other, where demand is significant and growing. Regional prices are
            generally higher in the carbon reduction cases, because of higher demand. Though more
            exaggerated, the pattern of growth across regions is much the same as in the reference
            case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The projected end-use prices
            for natural gas in the carbon reduction cases are double the prices in the reference case
            at their peak in the most extreme cases. The main components of end-use prices are the
            wellhead price, the carbon price, and transmission and distribution margins. On a
            percentage basis, residential prices are the least affected by the imposition of carbon
            prices, and the prices to electricity generators are the most affected (the projected
            carbon price is almost the same for both sectors, but gas prices are significantly higher
            in the residential sector). In 1996, natural gas prices for end users in the residential
            sector, which has the largest number of end-use customers, were $6.37 per thousand cubic
            feet. In the 1990-3% case, residential prices are expected to peak in 2013 at $11.31 per
            thousand cubic feet (in 1996 dollars), compared with $5.71 in the reference case (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph2.pdf">Figure 97</a>). The difference is almost entirely attributable to
            the carbon price, which adds $4.20 to residential gas prices in 2013. Wellhead prices and
            transmission margins are also projected to be higher, however, because of higher in total
            gas consumption even though residential consumption is lower. In the residential sector,
            margins for distribution services are higher because fixed costs must be spread over a
            smaller consumption base. In the 1990-7% case, residential prices are projected to peak at
            $12.10 per thousand cubic feet in 2013, because this case has the highest carbon prices.
            End-use prices in the carbon reduction cases follow a pattern similar to the pattern of
            carbon prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The story is much the same for
            the electricity supply sector, where the most growth in consumption is expected, except
            that the projected difference between wellhead and end-use margins is much smaller (less
            than 10 cents per thousand cubic feet) in the 1990-3% case in 2010. The differences in
            margins is not as high as in the residential sector because higher electric generator
            consumption allows gas utilities to spread their fixed costs over a larger volume of gas.
            In 1996, delivered prices to electricity generators were $2.70 per thousand cubic feet. At
            their peak in 2014, prices in the 1990-3% case are projected to be $8.27 per thousand
            cubic feet, compared with $3.05 in the reference case. As in the residential sector, the
            higher the carbon price, the higher the end-use price. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font ><font face="Arial" size="2">End-use prices for
            natural gas are affected by their distance from the sources of supply. End-use prices in
            the Texas-Louisiana region are currently less than half of prices in New England, for
            example. Although New England currently has the highest average natural gas end-use
            prices, prices are expected to be highest in the Mid-Atlantic region in a few years, as
            new pipeline projects are completed into New England and as consumption for electric
            generation increases. Regional prices are generally higher in the carbon reduction cases
            than in the reference case, because of higher demand. They show much the same pattern of
            growth as in the reference case.</font><font size="2" face="Palatino"> </font></font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Oil is a larger source of
            energy than natural gas. Nearly 40 percent of U.S. energy comes from oil, most of which is
            used to fuel our vehicles and industry. Gasoline and diesel oil fuel more than 200 million
            vehicles, one for every 1.3 people in the country. Almost half of our oil was imported by
            tanker ship from Venezuela, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and other countries at a cost of more
            than $60 billion in 1996. The rest is produced domestically, mainly in Texas, Alaska,
            Louisiana, and California, and shipped by pipeline and tanker. With the exception of
            residual fuel oil, this easily moved, universally-available liquid tends to cost more per
            Btu than other forms of energy. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In 1996, oil combustion
            produced 621 million metric tons of carbon emissions in the United States, over two-fifths
            of the total and more than those produced from burning coal. The transportation sector was
            responsible for the major share of those emissions, almost three quarters, followed by
            industrial and residential emissions in order of magnitude. In 2010, if no carbon
            reduction measures are put in place, emissions from oil combustion are expected to be more
            than 130 million metric tons higher than they were in 1996, although their share of the
            total will be slightly lower. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >U.S. oil consumption is
            expected to increase between 1996 and 2010 in the reference case, despite a projected
            decline in domestic oil production. Most of the growth is expected in the transportation
            sector, where oil consumption is projected to increase by almost 30 percent from 1996 to
            2010. About half the increase comes from light-duty vehicle travel and more than 20
            percent from increased air travel. Oil use in the industrial sector is projected to
            increase by about 15 percent between 1996 and 2010, with more than three-fifths of the
            increase coming in refining and petrochemical feedstocks. As a result of these increases,
            oil&#146;s share of the energy market will increase slightly over time. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >While petroleum production
            from conventional sources in the lower 48 States and in Alaska is expected to fall between
            1996 and 2010, enhanced oil recovery and offshore production are expected to increase, but
            not enough to prevent an overall decline. Net imports of crude oil and petroleum products
            are projected to rise to fill the gap between consumption and production. In the reference
            case, almost three-fifths of the U.S. oil supply in 2010 is projected to come from
            imports, with about three-fourths of total imports entering the country in the form of
            crude oil and the rest as finished or unfinished products. Gross refinery margins are
            projected to increase on the strength of increased refinery throughput and capacity
            expansion. End-use prices show little change in the reference case, as increases in world
            oil prices are balanced by assumed reductions in motor fuel taxes. Federal taxes on
            gasoline and diesel fuel are assumed to stay constant in real dollar terms, which would
            mean a decline in nominal terms. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font ><font face="Arial" size="2">Policies aimed at
            reducing carbon emissions would lead to lower consumption, production, imports, and
            refinery margins for the U.S. oil industry. On the other hand, end-use prices and market
            share would be higher. Higher end-use prices&#151;reflecting new carbon prices&#151; would
            reduce consumption in the carbon reduction cases, lessening the need for domestic
            production and foreign imports. Refinery margins in those cases would be lower, because
            consumption of petroleum products and expansion of refinery capacity are projected to be
            lower than in the reference case. Despite the lower levels of oil consumption projected in
            the carbon reduction cases, oil&#146;s share of the energy market would be higher as a
            result of an even larger drop in coal use. For example, in the 1990-3% case, oil is
            projected to claim 41 percent of the domestic energy market in 2010 and coal just 7
            percent, as compared with their respective 38-percent and 22-percent shares in 1996.</font><font size="2" face="Palatino"> </font></font></p>

            sector. Current petroleum product consumption is at about the previous peak level of
            consumption reached 20 years ago. In the reference case, consumption rises from 18.5
            million barrels per day in 1996 to 22.5 million barrels per day in 2010. In the carbon
            reduction cases, higher carbon prices overwhelm lower crude oil prices and lead to lower
            levels of oil consumption in 2010&#151;22.0 million barrels per day in the 1990+24% case
            and 20.0 million barrels per day in the 1990-3% case. Consumption in the transportation

            reference and the carbon reduction cases in 2010 is in the transportation sector. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the reference case,

            period after the carbon price is imposed. The higher the carbon price, the greater the
            decline in consumption. After 2009, consumption rises in all cases through the rest of the
            forecast, because highway and air travel increase while carbon prices change modestly. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Oil use in the transportation

            three most stringent carbon reduction cases, with smaller reductions in the residential,
            commercial, and industrial sectors. In the 1990-3% case, transportation consumption falls
            from 14.2 million barrels per day in 2004 to 13.5 million barrels per day in 2009,
            followed by a continuing increase to 15.0 million barrels per day in 2020. During the
            period of declining consumption, high carbon prices produce rapid increases in
            transportation fuel prices. After 2009, when consumption begins to rise, fuel prices in

            cases, but lower consumption and diminishing oil reserves in the later years of the carbon
            reduction cases lead to larger production declines. In the reference case, crude oil
            production is projected to drop from 6.5 million barrels per day in 1996 to 5.9 million
            barrels per day in 2010, compared with 5.8 million barrels per day in the 1990+24% case
            and 5.7 million barrels in the 1990+9% and 1990-3% cases in 2010. The higher the carbon
            price, the lower is the crude oil price, the less is the buildup in reserves, and the
            lower is oil production, because the higher carbon prices overwhelm lower crude oil

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Domestic oil drilling activity
            rises steadily in the reference case and in the least stringent carbon reduction case. In

            middle years of the forecasts, when high carbon prices depress oil prices. The lowest
            levels of drilling activity are seen in the cases with the highest projected carbon
            prices, which result in the lowest wellhead prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Despite the projections of
            increased oil drilling both in the reference case and in the carbon reduction cases, oil
            reserves are not expected to rise over the forecast period. Declining reserves are
            projected in all the cases, because reserve additions do not exceed production. For
            example, all the carbon reduction cases show reserve additions of only 1.9 billion barrels
            in 2005 (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph2.pdf">Figure 99</a>), when production is projected to be
            about 2.2 billion barrels for the year. Thus, oil reserves decline. In the reference case,
            higher oil prices sustain enough drilling for annual reserve additions to peak at 2.0
            billion barrels in 2009. In the more stringent carbon reduction cases, however, declining
            oil prices cause reserve additions to fall after 2005. The inability of the oil industry
            to replace reserves has less effect on oil prices than the inability to replace gas
            reserves has on gas prices, because oil prices are set in a world market, and because the
            RP ratios for oil are actually projected to rise. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Oil RP ratios, which are
            indicative of the industry&#146;s ability to sustain production, rise over the forecast
            both in the reference case and in the carbon reduction cases, as oil production falls more
            quickly than reserves. The RP ratio in the reference case rises from 7.1 in 1996 to 7.3 in
            2010. RP ratios in the carbon reduction cases are slightly lower, because the low oil
            prices in the carbon reduction cases depress reserve additions more than production. </font></p>

            conventional and enhanced oil recovery production&#151;the two types of production that
            are the most responsive to lower oil prices. In 2010, conventional onshore lower 48 oil
            production is 90,000 barrels per day lower in the 1990-3% case than in the reference case,
            60,000 barrels per day lower in the 1990+9% case, and 20,000 barrels per day lower in the
            1990+24% case. Enhanced oil recovery is 50,000 barrels per day lower in the 1990-3% case,
            40,000 barrels per day lower in the 1990+9% case, and 10,000 barrels per day lower in the
            1990+24% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Regionally, oil production is
            generally lower in the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case. It is
            significantly lower in the Southwest (western Texas and eastern New Mexico), in the Rocky
            Mountains, and in the offshore Gulf Coast, which are the largest producing regions. In the
            1990-3% case, for example, the projected production in 2010 in each of these regions is
            40,000 barrels per day less than projected in the reference case. In the Midcontinent
            region (Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas), oil production is slightly higher in the more
            stringent carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, because increased drilling
            for gas in the carbon reduction cases leads to more oil discoveries and greater oil
            production; however, the peak difference is only about 10,000 barrels per day. </font></p>

            crude oils is higher. Dense crude oils contain less of the higher-valued light products,
            like gasoline or diesel fuel, so their value is lower. Crude oil prices are lower in the

            imports of crude oil and petroleum products are lower in the carbon reduction cases than
            in the reference case, because oil consumption is projected to be lower, with domestic
            sources providing a greater share of the Nation&#146;s oil needs. As a share of total
            consumption, net oil imports reach 59 percent in 2010 in the reference and 1990+24% cases
            but only 54 percent in the 1990-3% case and 56 percent in the 1990+9% case. In all the
            cases, the projected import levels are above current levels, which are the highest yet
            recorded. The total value of net oil imports in 2010 is $103 billion in the reference case

            well below the 1980 peak of $138 billion (in 1996 dollars). Even in 2020, the total

            imports begin to fall when the carbon price is first imposed, bottoming out in 2009 before
            beginning to rise again. Imposition of relatively high carbon prices causes oil
            consumption&#151; and imports&#151;to fall temporarily in these cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Net petroleum product imports
            are affected more strongly than crude oil imports in the carbon reduction cases, because
            imported crude oil is generally more valuable to U.S. refiners than imported products
            inasmuch as profits are maximized only at high rates of refinery utilization. In the
            reference case, net product imports rise from 1.1 million barrels per day in 1996 to 3.1
            million barrels per day in 2010. In comparison, the corresponding increases are only
            70,000 barrels per day in the 1990-3% case, 760,000 barrels per day in the 1990+9% case,
            and 1.64 million barrels per day in the 1990+24% case. In the reference case and in the
            less stringent carbon reduction cases, net petroleum product imports exceed the historic
            1973 peak of 2.8 million barrels per day at some time during the forecast, beginning as

            the historic peak through 2020. In the 1990-7% case, net product imports remain below even

            individual petroleum products is projected to be lower in the carbon reduction cases than
            
            in the reference case, because higher prices lead to lower demand. Gasoline consumption in
            2010 is 3 percent lower in the 1990+24% case than in the reference case, 8 percent lower
            in the 1990+9% case, and 15 percent lower in the 1990-3% case, in direct response to the
            projected carbon prices. Distillate, diesel, and jet fuel consumption levels are also
            lower. Residual fuel is the least affected, because it is projected to compete
            successfully with natural gas and coal in the industrial sector. The projected consumption
            of residual fuel in 2020 is actually higher in the 1990+9% case than in the reference case
            because of higher industrial demand. </font></p>

            11 percent for jet fuel, 4 percent for residual fuel, and 24 percent all other products.
            The gasoline and jet fuel shares are slightly lower in the 1990-3% case, with slightly
            higher shares for the other, mostly heavier products. Purely on the basis of carbon
            content, consumption might be expected to move away from the heavier products, which have
            more carbon, and toward the lighter products; however, sector-by-sector tradeoffs with
            conservation and with other fuels are more critical to the shares. For example, residual
            fuel oil consumption in the industrial sector in 2010 is higher in the 1990-7% case than
            in the reference case, because the projected carbon price makes residual fuel less

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" ><b>Ethanol</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Ethanol consumption is
            generally expected to be higher in the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph3.pdf">Figure 101</a>). The United States consumed 80,000 barrels per day
            of ethanol in 1996 and is expected to consume 180,000 barrels per day in the reference
            case in 2010. Consumption is generally higher in the carbon reduction cases because of the
            growth in inexpensive cellulose-derived ethanol and because ethanol is exempt from the
            addition of a carbon price. However, ethanol consumption trends are quite complex because
            of changing legislation, production, and tax patterns. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In 1996 almost all ethanol
            consumed was blended directly into gasoline, but over the forecast period more ethanol is
            expected to be converted into an intermediate blending component or used in new types of
            alternative-fueled vehicles. At present ethanol is blended into gasoline as an
            &#147;oxygenate&#148; for reformulated and high oxygenated gasoline; up to 10 percent
            ethanol is also blended into traditional gasoline as a petroleum substitute. Oxygenates
            are used to reduce carbon monoxide emissions, as in oxygenated gasoline, or reduce the
            precursors of ozone pollution, as in reformulated gasoline. Besides ethanol, the other
            primary oxygenate is methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). One gallon of ethanol contains
            approximately twice the amount of oxygen as one gallon of MTBE, but gasoline containing
            ethanol cannot be transported in pipelines because ethanol has an affinity for water,
            which limits its use as a blending component. From 1996 to 2010 ethanol for blending is
            expected to remain at about 80,000 barrels per day in the reference case. In the more
            stringent carbon reduction cases, ethanol for blending is expected to be significantly
            higher; in the less stringent cases, it is expected to be slightly lower, because ethanol
            is more economically attractive when the carbon price is higher. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Similar to the methanol
            oxygenate MTBE, ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether), an ethanol oxygenate made from a
            combination of ethanol and isobutylene, is expected to become profitable in the next few
            years. The advantage of ETBE over straight ethanol is that it can easily be blended with
            gasoline and shipped by pipeline. In 2010 in the reference case, ethanol for ETBE
            production is 30,000 barrels per day. In the more stringent carbon reduction cases, ETBE
            production is expected to be slightly higher; in the less stringent cases, it is expected
            to be slightly lower, because ethanol is more economically attractive when the carbon
            price is higher. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >To further complicate matters,
            over the next few years, flexible fuel vehicles are expected to begin burning a
            significant amount of 85 percent ethanol fuel (E85), as a result of legislative mandates
            under the Energy Policy Act of 1992.<a href="fnote2.html#74"><sup>74</sup></a> Around
            2005, vehicles capable of burning only ethanol are projected to begin making a significant
            impact on the ethanol market, because they are expected to have one-third longer range and
            slightly higher gas mileage than flex-fuel vehicles. From 1996 to 2010, E85 consumption is
            expected to grow from less than 2,000 barrels per day to about 70,000 barrels per day in
            all cases, because E85 demand is expected to be driven primarily by legislative mandates.
            E85 demand is slightly higher in the less stringent carbon reduction cases, because the
            price of ethanol is attractive; demand is slightly lower in the more stringent carbon
            reduction cases because overall fuel demand is lower. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The sources of ethanol are
            also expected to change over time. At present ethanol is primarily derived from
            fermentation of corn. However, ethanol can also be made from cellulose biomass such as
            agricultural crop residuals, switchgrass, and other agricultural wood crops. In this
            analysis cellulose ethanol production was allowed to begin in 2001 at 1,300 barrels per
            day, based on current construction plans. From 2006 forward, capacity for cellulose-based
            ethanol is allowed to grow annually at 10,000 barrels per day for the reference case and
            16,000 barrels per day for the carbon reduction cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Ethanol produced from
            non-fossil fuels receives a Federal tax credit of 54 cents per gallon. This is equivalent
            to 5.4 cents per gallon on gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol. (The credit is
            prorated for blends of less than 10 percent and applies to the ethanol used to make ETBE.)
            The tax exemption is scheduled to decline to 51 cents a gallon from 2000 to 2007 and is
            allowed to remain at 51 cents through the rest of the forecast. Because this tax credit is
            in nominal dollars, inflation eats away about half its value in real terms by 2020. In the
            carbon reduction cases, a carbon price is not added to ethanol or the ethanol part of
            ETBE, because ethanol is produced with a non-fossil-fuel feedstock. Any carbon emitted
            from burning ethanol is assumed to be recovered when new crops are planted. To prevent
            ethanol from receiving both a tax credit and an advantage from not suffering an added
            carbon price, ethanol is allowed to receive the greater of the two; in some cases from
            2005 to 2007 the tax credit is greater. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the carbon reduction cases,
            ethanol consumption in some years is lower than in the reference case (Figure 101),
            because the carbon price causes the cost of corn-based ethanol to increase and not enough
            inexpensive cellulose-based ethanol is yet available. One of the costs of corn production
            is diesel fuel. When the cost of diesel fuel goes up because of the added carbon price in
            2005, the cost of ethanol rises. Higher ethanol prices make MTBE more attractive than
            ethanol as an oxygenate. In addition, declining oil prices and lower oil demand work to
            slow increases in the price of MTBE, which is usually made entirely from fossil fuels.
            Significant quantities of cellulose-based ethanol do not become available until after
            2005. Significant new demand for ethanol does not appear until after 2010, when the
            absence of an added carbon price in ethanol makes ethanol much more attractive as a
            feedstock for gasoline production. (Appendix A has additional information on the ethanol
            supply assumptions.) </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" ><b>Petroleum Product Prices</b> </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The projected prices of
            petroleum products in the carbon reduction cases are substantially higher than those in
            the reference case projections. For example, in 2010 the transportation sector gasoline
            price is 54 cents a gallon higher in the 1990-3% case than in the reference case (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph3.pdf">Figure 102</a>). Gasoline prices are higher in cases with higher
            carbon prices and lower in cases with lower carbon prices, and the prices of other
            petroleum products follow the same pattern. The primary components of petroleum product
            prices are the crude oil price, refinery processing, Federal and State taxes, carbon
            prices, and distribution costs. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In effect, carbon prices cause
            greater increases in the prices of fuels that have higher carbon contents. In the 1990+24%
            case, the carbon price in 2010 adds 21 cents per gallon to the price of residual fuel oil
            but only 9 cents per gallon to the price of liquefied petroleum gas; the corresponding
            price increases projected for gasoline, jet fuel, and distillate fuel oil are 16, 17, and
            19 cents per gallon. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >World oil prices and
            demand-side effects moderate to some extent the higher prices resulting from the carbon
            price. Higher product prices lead to reduction in demand in all the carbon reduction
            cases, which reduces world oil prices. Thus, the world oil price and demand effects
            combine to relieve some of the pressure on product prices that results from carbon prices
            (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/tbl22.html">Table 22</a>). The only product with a positive demand-side effect
            in the carbon reduction cases relative to the reference case is E85 in the 1990-3% and
            1990-7% cases (Table 22). Demand for ethanol grows more rapidly in the cases with higher
            projected carbon prices, because there is no carbon price added to ethanol-based products.
            (Because ethanol is made from renewable plant material, carbon emitted from burning
            ethanol is assumed to be recovered when new crops are planted.) In 2010, the projected
            demand for ethanol is 70 percent higher in the 1990-3% case than in the reference case.
            With the projected growth of demand for ethanol in the 1990-3% case, increasing supplies
            of inexpensive biomass-based ethanol are made available, reducing projected price
            increases in 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font ><font face="Arial" size="2">Regional petroleum
            product prices in the carbon reduction cases reflect many of the same market patterns that
            exist today. In general, the Northeast and Pacific regions continue to have the highest
            priced petroleum products in the reference case and the carbon reduction cases (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph3.pdf">Figure 103</a>). Prices in these regions remain relatively high
            because State tax rates are higher and supplies are limited. Limited refining capacity in
            the Northeast region increases reliance on imports and supplies brought in from other
            regions. In contrast, the Pacific region is isolated from outside sources of supply by
            geography and by environmental restrictions. Geographically separated from the rest of the
            Nation by the Rocky Mountains, California must rely heavily on its own refinery
            production. In addition, the State of California has the most restrictive environmental
            regulations on gasoline and diesel in the country, which result in additional processing
            costs and further limit California&#146;s sources of supply</font><font size="2" face="Palatino">. </font></font></p>

            reducing refinery emissions of greenhouse gases, and at the same time demand for their
            primary products would decline. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Lower demand for petroleum

            million barrels per day in 2010, with a utilization rate of 95 percent. In comparison, in
            the 1990+24% and 1990-3% cases, the projections for distillation capacity in 2010 are 16.8
            and 16.5 million barrels per day, respectively, with utilization rates of 95 and 93
            percent. From 2010 to 2020, distillation capacity grows in the carbon reduction cases in
            response to increasing petroleum consumption. U.S. refiners are not expected to recover
            all the investments in new capacity made before 2003 in the 1990-3% case, because
            consumption drops off between 2005 and 2015. Thus, utilization drops off particularly in
            2009 in the 1990-3% case. Reduced utilization rates and product consumption may have an
            adverse impact on smaller or less competitive refineries that cannot develop ways to
            increase product margins or market share. In the 1990+9% and 1990+24% cases, utilization

            refineries in the carbon reduction cases drops off after 2010, because gas is projected to
            be more expensive than petroleum. The higher price for natural gas causes petroleum fuel
            consumption to rise. Late in the forecast LPG and residual fuel consumed at refineries are
            higher in the more severe carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, because still
            gas production and consumption are lower as a result of lower crude inputs to refineries,
            and because higher natural gas prices result from the higher demand for natural gas.
            Refinery processing gain also follows the petroleum product consumption and domestic
            refinery production of products, with processing gains 4 percent and 11 percent lower in
            the 1990+24% and 1990-3% cases, respectively, than in the reference case in 2010. </font></p>

            in response to lower product consumption (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph4.pdf">Figure 104</a>). In

            remain about the same, and those for jet fuel increase slightly in the carbon reduction

            share, nearly 31 percent, of U.S. domestic energy production. Electric utilities and
            independent power producers generate more than 55 percent of all electricity via
            coal-fired technology and account for approximately 89 percent of domestic coal
            consumption. Steam coal is also consumed in the industrial sector to produce process heat,
            steam, and synthetic gas and to cogenerate electricity, and metallurgical coal is used to
            make coke for the iron and steel industry. With more than 90 million tons<a href="fnote2.html#75"><sup>75</sup></a> of steam and metallurgical coal shipped in 1996,
            coal is the only net energy fuel export for the United States. In the reference case, coal
            production and domestic consumption (expressed in tons) are projected to increase at rates
            of 1.1 and 0.9 percent per year, respectively, and coal exports are projected to increase
            somewhat more rapidly at a rate of 1.5 percent annually through 2020, primarily reflecting
            the continued growth of steam coal consumption for electricity generation in both domestic

            carbon emissions will have a significant negative impact on the coal industry. In the
            carbon reduction cases analyzed here, the advantages of the low carbon content of natural
            gas and the zero net carbon emissions that are associated with renewables offset the
            relatively low fuel cost of coal for use in electricity generation. Thus, coal markets are
            projected to be severely affected, in terms of both overall sales and supply patterns, as
            the need to reduce carbon emissions results in significant shifts away from coal
            consumption to natural gas, renewable energy, efficiency improvements in the demand
            sectors, and&#151;in some cases&#151; nuclear energy (see Chapter 4 for a discussion of

            Considerations</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Coal, oil, and natural gas
            respond differently to restrictions on carbon emissions. Of the three, coal is most
            affected for reasons that relate to the nature of its markets and its chemical structure.
            Electricity generation markets, by far the largest market for coal, are increasingly
            competitive and cost-conscious as restructuring initiatives by States have increasing
            influence on fuel purchase strategies. Fossil fuels derive their energy content primarily
            from oxidation of their carbon and hydrogen contents. A fee based on carbon emissions from
            burning fossil fuels (i.e., a carbon price) naturally falls most heavily on coal, because
            coal derives a higher percentage of its energy content from the oxidation of carbon than
            do oil and natural gas. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Coal is heterogeneous in terms
            of both its energy content and carbon content. Subbituminous coal derives a higher
            proportion of its energy from carbon than does bituminous coal; thus, production in the
            large low-sulfur coalfields of the Northern Great Plains (Wyoming and Montana) would be
            more affected by carbon emissions restrictions than would bituminous coalfields such as
            those in Colorado and Utah, the Appalachian States, and the Interior region. Lignite,
            which is produced primarily in Texas, North Dakota, and Louisiana, has more carbon content
            than subbituminous coal, and its production would be more severely affected than that of
            bituminous or subbituminous coal in the carbon reduction cases, in the absence of any
            offsetting factors such as close proximity to customers. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Other factors that would
            affect the regional impacts of carbon emission restrictions on different coalfields stem
            from differences in mining and transportation costs. Subbituminous coal production in the
            southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming had an average mine price of $6.41 per ton in 1996,
            as compared with bituminous mine prices of $26.68 per ton in Appalachia, $21.43 in the
            Interior, and $21.61 in the western States. However, there is only a limited market for
            subbituminous coal in the regions where it is mined. This coal has achieved national
            importance in the past two decades because of its low sulfur content and mining costs,
            giving it the ability to bear transportation costs of $20.00 per ton or more while
            retaining economic competitiveness in markets on the Atlantic, Pacific, Great Lakes, and
            Gulf coasts, up to 2,000 miles from its origin. A carbon price would create a double
            penalty for such coal, first by penalizing the coal for its inherent high ratio of carbon
            to energy content, second by penalizing the carbon content in the transportation fuels
            that are required to bring it to market. Thus, carbon emissions restrictions would most
            heavily penalize those coals most dependent on transportation to reach their markets. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the reference case, U.S.
            coal production climbs to 1,287 million tons in 2010 and 1,376 million tons in 2020 (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph4.pdf">Figure 105</a>). In the carbon reduction cases, U.S. coal
            production begins a slow decline early in the next decade, accelerates rapidly downward
            through 2010, and then continues to drop slowly through 2020. Coal production in the
            1990+24% case is 20 percent lower by 2010, at 1,032 million tons, in the 1990+9% case is
            52 percent lower than reference case levels by 2010, at 624 million tons, and 71 percent
            lower in the 1990-3% case at 369 million tons. By 2020, coal production in the 1990+24%
            case is 805 million tons and in the 1990+9% case is 405 million tons, and production in
            the 1990-3% case drops to a mere 172 million tons. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The projected declines in coal
            production result primarily from sharp cutbacks in the use of steam coal for electricity
            generation. Additional declines in production occur from reductions in the use of coal for
            boiler fuel within the industrial sector, as a result of fuel switching to natural gas. In
            2010, coal consumption by electricity generators in the 1990+24% case is 20 percent lower
            than in the reference case, in the 1990+9% case is 57 percent lower, and in the 1990-3%
            case it is 79 percent lower. Lower consumption results from a reduction (via retirements)
            of in-place coal capacity, as well as lower dispatch rates for coal-fired generation
            because the coal capacity that remains available is used less intensively. In 2010,
            coal-burning capability in the electricity supply sector drops from 308 gigawatts in the
            reference case to 300 gigawatts (a 3-percent decline) in the 1990+24% case, 276 gigawatts
            (a 10-percent decline) in the 1990+9% case, and 266 gigawatts (a 13-percent decline) in
            the 1990-3% case. Utilization of existing coal capacity drops from 77 percent in the
            reference case to 65 percent in the 1990+24% case, to 40 percent in the 1990+9% case, and
            to 22 percent in the 1990-3% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In 2020, coal consumption by
            electricity generators is projected to be 630 million tons in the 1990+24% case, with
            coal-fired generating capacity at 271 gigawatts and utilization at 55 percent, and only
            235 million tons in the 1990+9% case, with coal capacity at 198 gigawatts and utilization
            at 29 percent. In the 1990-3% case, increased retirements of coal-fired plants result in
            coal capacity of 100 gigawatts (approximately one-third of reference case levels), coal
            consumption for electricity generation of 33 million tons, and a very low utilization rate
            of 9 percent. Operating and maintenance costs per unit of electricity generated will
            increase for coal plants that are run at low utilization because of thermal fatigue and
            the inefficiencies of starting and stopping units that were designed for baseload
            operation. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The expected reductions in
            coal exports and industrial uses in the carbon reduction cases are somewhat less severe
            than those in the electricity supply sector, because not all coal-importing countries will
            be subject to strict carbon caps, and because certain industrial consumers have less
            flexibility (because of plant configuration or fuel availability) to switch to lower
            carbon-emitting fuels. As a result, coal production from regions such as Central
            Appalachia that now serve this set of customers declines somewhat less severely than that
            from regions such as the Powder River Basin that have the heaviest dependence on
            electricity producers. Coal export projections are discussed later in this section. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Reductions in coal consumption
            are expected to occur in all regions and consuming sectors, but they will be of different
            magnitudes and affect different coal types. As a result, regional production patterns in
            the carbon reduction cases will shift differentially across regions relative to the
            reference case, rather than on a basis that is strictly proportional to national levels of
            coal consumption. In the electricity generation sector, each reduction in overall coal
            generation will make it easier to achieve the Clean Air Act Amendments sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)
            target of 9 million tons of SO<sub>2</sub>, and in the more severe carbon reduction cases,
            prices for the SO<sub>2</sub> allowances will be driven to zero. There will be upward
            pressure on coal transportation rates, as a result of higher prices (from carbon prices)
            on the diesel fuel used for rail, barge, and truck transportation. At the same time, lower
            quantities of coal shipments could place downward pressure on transportation rates. The
            strong shift to greater use of low-sulfur coal, particularly that mined in the West, in
            the reference case will cease and reverse in consuming regions where local mid- and
            high-sulfur coal can be delivered at a lower cost than western coal. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >The slower decline in coal
            consumption in the industrial, metallurgical coal, and export sectors in the carbon
            reduction cases will translate into relatively less severe production cuts in regions that
            currently supply these markets than the reductions in those regions that depend more
            heavily on electricity generators. Nevertheless, there will be intensified intraregional
            competition to serve these important, albeit declining markets, and some interregional
            shifts in production occur in the forecast as regional demands shift. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the reference case, the
            western share of total U.S. coal production increases from 47 percent in 1996 to 57

            coal under the Clean Air Act Amendments (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph4.pdf">Figure 106</a>). In
            contrast, the western share in the carbon reduction cases decreases to 54 percent in the

            2010. Approximately 75 percent of the 179 million ton reduction in western coal production
            in the 1990+24% case, 486 million ton reduction in the 1990+9% case, and the 628 million
            ton reduction in the 1990-3% case is borne by subbituminous surface mines in the Powder
            River Basin. The low-sulfur coal from these surface mines is used almost exclusively for
            electricity generation and must be transported over relatively long distances to reach
            many of the markets that are projected to expand in the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >As overall demand falls,
            eastern minemouth prices are reduced, and there is less economic incentive to transport

            transportation fuel costs increase, and its potential to expand into most industrial and
            export applications is limited by its lower heat content and other physical

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Because coal is heterogeneous
            in terms of heat content, sulfur level, and other physical properties, trends in national
            average prices are affected substantially by the relative shares of the various coal types
            produced and sold and by the units in which prices are reported. For example, coal from
            the Powder River Basin is generally the lowest-priced coal per ton on a minemouth basis;
            however, because Powder River Basin coal has roughly two-thirds the heat content of
            bituminous coal, its cost advantage is somewhat less on a Btu basis and may be nonexistent
            when delivered to more distant markets. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In general, to the extent that
            market share shifts away from Powder River Basin coal, which has a low minemouth price, to
            higher-priced bituminous coal, the national average minemouth price will increase.
            Similarly, the greater the share represented by metallurgical coal and by premium grades
            of coal for export use, the higher will be the share-weighted average price. This
            compositional effect offsets the reduction in minemouth prices at the regional level that
            is likely to occur because of intraregional competition and the lower production
            quantities that occur when carbon restrictions take effect. The regional productivity
            improvements projected in the reference case are assumed to occur at the same rates in all
            the carbon reduction cases given the same rate of technological progress. However, if the
            level of investment in new capital equipment is severely constrained, there could be
            adverse impacts on productivity. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In 2010, real minemouth prices
            are projected to decrease to $14.29 per ton in the reference case but increase to $14.72
            in the 1990+24% case, to $16.42 in the 1990+9% case, and to $17.90 in the 1990-3% case (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph4.pdf">Figure 107</a>). Minemouth prices in individual regions generally
            decline in all cases, but the national average minemouth price increases in the carbon
            reduction cases because of the shift in quantity shares to higher grade and higher priced
            coal and away from coal with a lower minemouth price, such as that from the Powder River
            Basin. In some instances, however, even the regional weighted average price for a given
            coal rank will increase relative to the reference case, if a greater share of coal is
            being shipped to export or metallurgical markets that demand premium-grade (and therefore
            higher priced) coals. The pattern of higher national average prices in the carbon
            reduction cases is accentuated by the projections for 2020, when prices increase from the
            reference case value of $12.53 to $14.29 in the 1990+24% case, to $16.24 in the 1990+9%

            The carbon price dominates the effects on delivered prices in the carbon reduction cases.
            In 2010, the carbon fee adds $1.73 per million Btu to the delivered price of coal to

            to $2.55, $3.62, and $6.14 per million Btu, respectively because the carbon price for all
            fuels is lower in 2020. </font></p>

            from 246,000 to 83,000. The decrease primarily reflected strong growth in labor
            
            productivity, which increased at an annual rate of 6.7 percent over the same period. An
            additional factor was increased output from large surface mines in the Powder River Basin,
            which require much less labor per ton of output than mines located in the Interior and
            Appalachian regions. The Powder River Basin share of total U.S. coal production increased

            from 5.8 percent in 1996 to approximately 1.6 percent per year from 2010 to 2020. With
            improvements continuing over the forecast period, further declines in employment of 1.3

            percent a year between 1996 and 2010, falling from 83,000 in 1996 to 58,000 in 2010 (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/pdf/c5graph4.pdf">Figure 109</a>). In the 1990+9% case, employment declines at a
            more rapid rate of 4.6 percent a year to 2010, resulting in employment of only 43,000
            miners in 2010. In the 1990-3% case, coal mine employment declines at a rate of 7.2
            percent a year between 1996 and 2010, reaching 29,000 in 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Production and employment are
            positively correlated. In 2010, the projected levels of coal production in the 1990+24%
            and 1990-3% cases are 20 percent and 75 percent lower, respectively, than in the reference

            in the reference case and employment in the 1990-3% case in 2010 is only 57 percent below
            the reference case. The projected declines in employment are smaller than the declines in
            production because of the relatively greater losses in output projected from mines in the
            Northern Great Plains, which require less labor per unit of output than mines in other
            coal-producing regions. </font></p>

            States. The table shows that the wages associated with coal mining exceeded 2 percent of
            all wages paid in 1996 in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Wyoming. In West Virginia and
            Wyoming, they accounted for more than 5 percent of all wages paid. The fact that coal
            mining wages are higher than average wages in these States is shown by the fact that coal
            industry jobs account for a greater share of total wages than their share of total
            employment. In West Virginia, the coal industry employs 3.2 percent of all workers in the
            State but accounts for 6.5 percent of all wages paid. In Wyoming, coal industry workers
            account for only 2.2 percent of all jobs but earn 5.3 percent of all wages. Similarly, in
            Kentucky, the coal industry provides 1.2 percent of all jobs but 2.1 percent of all wages.
            Table 24 also shows that while the potential for direct losses of coal-related wages and
            employment is concentrated in the 10 States listed, it is much more strongly concentrated
            in West Virginia, Kentucky, Wyoming, and perhaps Pennsylvania (depending on whether the
            absolute amount of wages and employment at stake is counted, or the relative proportion of
            the State&#146;s total wages and employment). </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >U.S. coal producers exported
            90 million tons of coal in 1996. Of that amount, 59 percent represented shipments of
            coking coal for use at integrated steel plants worldwide, and 41 percent was steam coal,
            used primarily for electricity generation and for the production of process steam and
            direct heat for industrial applications. In 1997, U.S. coal exports fell by 7 million
            tons, reversing the upward trend of the previous 2 years. The decline was mostly in steam
            coal exports, as a result of weak international coal prices and strong competition from
            other coal-exporting countries. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the reference case, U.S.
            coal exports are projected to&nbsp;increase from 90 million tons in 1996 to 113 million
            tons in 2010. All the increase reflects expected growth in&nbsp;steam coal exports, with
            exports of metallurgical coal projected to decline slightly. In the reference case, world
            metallurgical coal trade remains relatively constant, although regionally there is a
            slight shift away from&nbsp;markets in Europe and Japan to Brazil and the developing
            countries in Asia. World steam coal trade is projected to increase by 45 percent between
            1996 and 2010, rising from 305 million tons to 441 million tons. The U.S. share of total
            world coal trade is projected to remain constant at about 18 percent.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the reference case,
            Japan&#146;s remaining two coal mines are assumed to be closed shortly after 2000.
            Currently these mines have a combined annual production capacity of about 3.5 million
            tons, representing less than 3 percent of Japan&#146;s total coal consumption. In 1996,
            coal consumption in Japan amounted to 144 million tons&#151;82 million tons of steam coal
            
            (including 9.5 million tons of coal for pulverized coal injection at blast furnaces) and
            62 million tons of coking coal. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In the carbon reduction cases,
            two alternative coal trade scenarios were developed. In a severe carbon reduction case
            (1990-3%), carbon emissions in Western Europe were assumed to be 8 percent below their
            1990 level by 2010 consistent with the limits for the European Union that were specified
            in the Kyoto Protocol. Similarly, carbon emissions in Japan were assumed to be 6 percent
            below their 1990 level by 2010. Coal was assumed to play a proportionately greater role
            than oil or natural gas in meeting these emission reductions, because it has a higher
            carbon content (on a Btu basis) and the opportunities to substitute for petroleum products
            in the transportation sector are limited. In Western Europe, both domestic coal production
            and imports were assumed to decline by approximately 50 percent, but in Japan coal imports
            had to account for the total reduction in coal consumption. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >In Europe, steam coal imports
            from all sources are reduced from 156 million tons in the reference case in 2010 to 47
            million tons in the 1990-3% case. Only steam coal imports to the industrialized Annex I
            countries in Europe are reduced. Steam coal imports to Japan, the only Annex I country in
            
            Asia, are reduced from 99 million tons in the reference case in 2010 to 56 million tons in
            the 1990-3% case. Because other fuels are not easily substituted for coal coke at steel
            plants, coking coal imports are not adjusted downward. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Steam coal imports to Japan
            are reduced by a relatively smaller amount than are imports to Europe, primarily because
            Japan has limited access to alternative sources of energy such as natural gas and
            renewable fuels. In addition to reduced use of coal, other strategies that Japan may
            pursue to meet its carbon reduction targets include purchasing surplus emission allowances
            from other signatory countries and pursuing an accelerated nuclear program.<a href="fnote2.html#77"><sup>77</sup></a></font></p>

            or below the 1990 level in 2010) than in the reference case. In these cases, U.S. coal

            to decline by a smaller amount than in the severe case discussed above, reflecting the
            lower emission target. Japanese coal consumption and imports were also assumed to decline
            by a smaller amount as in the severe case. In Europe, projected steam coal imports from

                    consumers partly or entirely by rail. Coal freight provided Class I railroads with $7.7
                    billion, 23 percent of all revenue earned. Coal freight car loadings and ton-miles tend to
                    be dominated by a handful of railroads. For the major coal-hauling railroads, coal
                    represented 39 percent of all car loadings during 1996.<sup>a</sup> Available data from
                    the Federal Railroad Administration that summarize railroads&#146; reported return on
                    investment and the extent of their dependence on coal freight revenues are shown in the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/archive/1998/kyoto/revtbl.html">table</a> below. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Because the carbon reduction
                    cases analyzed here project heavier losses in coal production for western than for eastern
                    coalfields, and because much of the production from western coalfields is shipped long
                    distances into midwestern and eastern markets to satisfy demand for low-sulfur fuel, it is
                    likely that the burden of reduced coal transportation revenues would fall most heavily on
                    railroads in the West&#151;particularly on the Burlington-Northern and Union Pacific
                    systems, which now include the St. Louis Southwestern, the Chicago &amp; Northwestern, the
                    Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western, the Southern Pacific, and the Atchison, Topeka &amp;
                    Santa Fe railroads. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Progressively deregulated
                    since the Staggers Rail Act of 1986, railroads have made substantial progress in improving
                    productivity and reducing real costs by investing in new and more powerful locomotives,
                    improved maintenance of main-line rights of way, and more efficient use of labor. A major
                    contribution to achieving the joint goals of lower costs and maintenance of service has
                    been made through a number of mergers over the past decade. Mergers have resulted in the
                    emergence of four major railroad companies&#151;two in the East (CSX and Norfolk-Southern)
                    and two in the West (Burlington Northern - Santa Fe and Union Pacific - Southern Pacific).
                    The recent merger between Union Pacific and Southern Pacific was followed by a period of
                    service problems (particularly in Texas, but also affecting rail shipments throughout the
                    Union Pacific - Southern Pacific system) that have not yet been entirely resolved. As a
                    result of these service issues, there has been controversy surrounding the policies of the
                    Surface Transportation Board as it has sought to balance the needs of railroad shippers
                    and the continued profitability of the Union Pacific, and of the Nation&#146;s major
                    railroads in general. Even if these issues are successfully resolved over the next few
                    years, the adoption of carbon emissions restrictions would inevitably result in a
                    reduction in domestic coal traffic handled by the railroads. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >As suggested by the results of
                    the carbon reduction cases, the reductions in coal traffic range from moderate to severe,
                    depending on the case. In all cases, western coal, particularly subbituminous coal from
                    the Powder River Basin, would be most severely restricted, because of its dependence on
                    long-distance rail transportation to reach its markets in locations up to 2,000 miles away
                    and its high ratio of carbon to energy content. As shown in the table, the Burlington
                    Northern and Union Pacific systems have a fairly high dependence on coal freight revenue;
                    therefore, the loss of revenue associated with carbon reduction measures could create
                    significant financial problems for those firms. Lignite production in Texas, Louisiana,
                    and North Dakota would also be severely reduced by carbon emissions restrictions, but the
                    effect on rail revenues would be minor. Because of its inherently low heat content,
                    lignite is predominantly consumed at or close to the place of mining. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" >Although the projected losses
                    of coal production in the individual carbon reduction cases are proportionately and
                    absolutely less for Appalachian coalfields than for the Powder River Basin, the two
                    eastern rail systems (CSX and Norfolk Southern) are also highly dependent on coal revenue.
                    In the more severe carbon reduction cases, Appalachian coal production could be reduced by
                    one-third to one-half, with potentially serious financial consequences for these carriers. </font></p>
