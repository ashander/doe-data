<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because energy resources are
            used to produce most goods and services, higher energy prices can affect the
            economy&#146;s production potential. Since the energy crisis of the 1970s, economic
            research has led to a better understanding of the potential adverse economic consequences
            of rising real energy costs, in terms of both long-run equilibrium costs and short-run
            adjustment costs. Long-run equilibrium costs are associated with reducing reliance on
            energy in favor of other factors of production&#151;including labor and capital, which
            become relatively cheaper as energy costs rise. Short-run adjustment costs, or business
            cycle costs, can arise when price increases disrupt capital or employment markets.
            Long-run costs are considered unavoidable. Short-run costs might be avoidable if price
            changes can be accurately anticipated or if appropriate compensatory monetary and fiscal
            policies can be implemented. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This chapter assesses possible
            impacts on the economy associated with attaining the alternative carbon mitigation targets
            presented earlier in this report, focusing on three target cases&#151;the
            3-percent-below-1990 (1990-3%), the 9-percent-above-1990 (1990+9%), and the
            24-percent-above-1990 (1990+24%) cases&#151;and comparing them with a reference case that
            does not include the Kyoto Protocol. In evaluating these alternative targets, three key
            questions are posed: </font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">What would be the unavoidable minimum impact
              on the economy? <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">With rising energy prices and inflation,
              what cyclical reactions could the economy face, and how would the Federal Reserve Board
              implement accommodating monetary policy? <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">What would be the impact of fiscal policy on
              economic output and inflation? </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">EIA used the Data Resources,
            Inc. (DRI) model of the U.S. economy to assess these issues.<a href="fnote2.html#78"><sup>78</sup></a> The DRI model is a&nbsp;representation of the U.S. economy with detailed output, price,
            and financial sectors incorporating both long-term and short-term properties. In the DRI
            model, the concept of <i>potential</i> GDP reflects the trajectory of the long-term growth
            potential of the economy at full employment, while <i>actual</i> GDP is a measure of the
            transition effects as the economy adjusts to its long-run path. Energy end-use demands and
            prices for fuels are the key energy inputs to the DRI model.<a href="fnote2.html#79"><sup>79</sup></a> In addition, for this analysis, assumptions were made about the domestic flow of funds
            that would result from a U.S. system of carbon permits sold by the Federal Government, and
            about the international flow of funds that would result from international trading of
            permits. These assumptions were based on the results of the energy market analyses
            described in the preceding chapters of this report. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This chapter first presents a
            discussion of the U.S. permit system and the potential role of international trading of
            permits. A summary of the macroeconomic effects is presented next, focusing on the
            definition and measurement of <i>potential GDP</i>, <i>actual GDP</i>, and the <i>value of
              the purchased international permits</i> as key elements. The chapter then discusses in
            detail two topics. The first addresses the unavoidable loss to the economy that would
            result from a reduction in available energy resources. The unavoidable loss has two
            components: the loss in potential GDP and the value of the purchased international
            permits. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the possible transitional impacts on
            the aggregate economy that might occur as energy prices increase in response to carbon
            emission constraints. The critical roles of monetary and fiscal policy are highlighted.
            Two fiscal policies are considered as alternative methods of returning carbon permit
            revenues to the economy: through a lump sum personal income tax rebate and through a
            social security tax rebate that would pass funds back to both employers and employees. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>The U.S. Permit System
            and International Trading of Permits</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Two key features shape the
            discussion in this chapter&#151; first, the characterization of the carbon permit trading
            system as an auction run by the Federal Government; and second, the international trading
            of carbon permits. Both of these issues have important implications for the assessment of
            the potential macroeconomic impacts of carbon mitigation policies. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The U.S. Permit
            System</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">When a system is developed for
            the trading of carbon permits within the United States, a number of initial decisions must
            be made: How many permits will be available? Will they be freely allocated or sold by
            competitive auction? If they are allocated, how will the initial allocations be made? If
            they are sold, what will be done with the revenues? How many permits will be bought in
            international markets? If the permits are traded in a free market, holders of permits who
            can reduce carbon emissions at a cost below the permit price will sell their permits, and
            those with higher costs of reduction will buy permits, resulting in a transfer of funds
            between private parties. If the permits are sold by competitive auction, there will be a
            transfer of funds from emitters of carbon to the Federal treasury. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="2">This analysis makes the
            explicit assumption that carbon permits will be sold in a competitive auction run by the
            Federal Government.<a href="fnote2.html#80"><sup>80</sup></a> To illustrate the importance
            of recycling the funds back to the economy, two fiscal policy approaches are considered:
            first, returning collected revenues to consumer through personal income tax rebates and,
            second, lowering the social security tax rate as it applies to both employers and
            employees. The two policies are meant only to be representative of a set of possible
            fiscal policies that might accompany an initial carbon mitigation policy</font><font size="2" face="Palatino">. </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>International Trading
            of Permits</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the energy market
            assessments described earlier in this report, the projected carbon prices reflect the
            price the United States would be willing to pay to achieve a given emissions reduction
            target. The more stringent the carbon target, the higher the carbon price. The energy
            market analysis in this report does not address the international implications of
            achieving a particular target at the projected carbon price. In the absence of modeling
            international trade of emissions permits, the energy market assessment makes no link
            between the U.S. carbon price and the international market-clearing price of permits, or
            the price at which other countries would be willing to offer permits for sale in the
            United States. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The macroeconomic analysis in
            this chapter departs from the above interpretation in order to facilitate an evaluation of
            the role of the purchase of permits in an international market. The analysis first assumes
            that the U.S. State Department&#146;s assessment of the accounting of carbon-absorbing
            sinks and offsets from reductions in other greenhouse gases will reduce the binding U.S.
            emissions target to 3 percent below the 1990 level of emissions. Then, if the United
            States is to meet a target that is less stringent, the difference in emissions is assumed
            to be made up through the purchase of permits on the international market. Moreover, the
            United States is assumed to purchase international permits at <i>the marginal abatement
              cost in the United States</i>. Thus, the domestic carbon price would be the same as the
            international permit price under the alternative targets considered. If unrestricted
            international trading among Annex I countries is allowed, the international carbon price
            could fall below the levels projected here for domestic permits. If this were to occur, to
            achieve equilibrium in an unconstrained market for carbon permits, the domestic carbon
            price would fall to the international carbon price. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="2">The above assumptions
            imply that different international supplies of permits would be available in the
            alternative cases considered. This is an important simplifying assumption, and the value
            placed on the overseas transfer of funds to purchase international permits is subject to
            considerable uncertainty. However, this element must be considered a key factor in
            performing any assessment of the impacts on the economy, and therefore it is explicitly
            factored into the analysis. <a href="tbl25.html">Table 25</a> shows the assumed carbon
            reductions, carbon prices, and number and value of carbon emission permits purchased on
            the international market in the 1990-3%, 1990+9%, and 1990+24% cases.</font><font size="2" face="Palatino"> </font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Summary of Macroeconomic
            Impacts</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the long run, higher energy
            costs would reduce the use of energy by shifting production toward less energy-intensive
            sectors, by replacing energy with labor and capital in specific production processes, and
            by encouraging energy conservation. Although reflecting a more efficient use of
            higher-cost energy, this gradual reduction in energy use would tend to lower the
            productivity of other factors in the production process. The derivation of the long-run
            equilibrium path of the economy can be characterized as representing the
            &#147;potential&#148; output of the economy when all resources&#151;labor, capital, and
            energy&#151;are fully employed. As such, potential gross domestic product (GDP) in the DRI
            model is equivalent to the full employment concept calculated in a number of other models
            that focus on long-run growth while abstracting from business cycle behavior.<a href="fnote2.html#81"><sup>81</sup></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The ultimate impacts of carbon
            mitigation policies on the economy will be determined by complex interactions between
            elements of aggregate supply and demand, in conjunction with monetary and fiscal policy
            decisions. As such, cyclical impacts on the economy are bound to be characterized by
            uncertainty, possibly significant. Raising energy prices and, as a result, downstream
            prices in the rest of the economy could introduce cyclical behavior in the economy,
            resulting in employment and output losses in the short run. The measurement of losses in
            actual output for the economy, or actual GDP, incorporates the transitional cost to the
            aggregate economy as it adjusts to its long-run path. Resources may be less than fully
            employed, and the economy may move in a cyclical fashion as the initial cause of the
            disturbance&#151;the increase in energy prices&#151;plays out over time. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="2">The possible impacts on
            the economy are summarized in <a href="tbl26.html">Table 26</a>, which shows average
            changes from the reference case projections over the period from 2008 through 2012 in the
            three carbon reduction analysis cases.<a href="fnote2.html#82"><sup>82</sup></a> The <i>loss
              of potential GDP</i> measures the loss in productive capacity of the economy directly
            attributable to the reduction in energy resources available to the economy. It represents
            part of the long-run, unavoidable impact on the economy. The <i>macroeconomic adjustment
              cost</i> reflects frictions in the economy that may result from the higher prices of the
            carbon mitigation policy. It recognizes the possibility that cyclical adjustments may
            occur in the short run. The <i>loss in actual GDP</i> for the economy is the sum of the
            loss in potential and the adjustment cost. The <i>purchase of international permits</i> represents a claim on the productive capacity of domestic U.S. resources. Essentially, as
            funds flow abroad, other countries have an increased claim on U.S. goods and services. The <i>total cost to the economy</i> is represented by the loss in actual GDP plus the
            purchase of international permits (<a href="pdf/c6graph1.pdf">Figure 110</a>). These costs
            
            need to be put in perspective relative to the size of the economy, which is projected to
            average $9,425 billion between 2008 and 2012 in the reference case</font><font size="2" face="Palatino">. </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Another way to view the
            macroeconomic effects is by looking at the effects of the carbon reduction cases on the
            growth rate of the economy, both during the period of implementation and during the early
            part of the commitment period, from 2005 through 2010, and then over the entire period
            from 2005 through 2020 (<a href="pdf/c6graph1.pdf">Figures 111 and 112</a>). In all
            instances, the economy continues to grow, but growth is slower than projected in the
            reference case. In the reference case, potential and actual GDP grow at 2.0 percent per
            year from 2005 through 2010. In the 1990+9% case, the growth rate in potential GDP slows
            to 1.9 percent per year, and the growth rate in actual GDP slows to 1.6 percent per year
            when the personal income tax rebate is assumed or 1.8 percent per year when the social
            security tax rebate is assumed. However, through 2020, with the economy rebounding back to
            the reference case path, there is no appreciable change in the projected long-term growth
            rate. The results for the 1990+24% and 1990-3% cases are similar. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Aggregate impacts on the
            economy, as measured by actual GDP, are shown in <a href="tbl27.html">Table 27</a> in
            terms of losses in actual GDP per capita. In the 1990+9% case, the loss in potential GDP
            per capita is $106; however, the loss in actual GDP for in the 1990+9% case is $567
            assuming the personal income tax rebate and $305 assuming the social security tax rebate.
            Again, the lower value (loss in potential GDP) represents part of the unavoidable loss per
            person, and the higher values (loss in actual GDP) reflect the highly uncertain, but
            significant, impacts that individuals could experience as the result of frictions within
            the economy. Again, to provide scale, actual GDP per capita averages $31,528 in the
            reference case from 2008 through 2012. </font></p>

            113</a> shows the losses in the potential economic output, as measured by potential GDP,
            for the three carbon reduction cases. The shapes of the three trajectories mirror the
            carbon price trajectories. In the 1990-3% case, potential GDP declines relative to the
            reference case from 2005 through 2008, reaching a maximum loss of $64 billion (in 1992
            dollars) in 2012 and then leveling off at just under $60 billion a year through 2020. In
            the 1990+9% case, the loss in potential GDP declines to $35 billion by 2011 and reaches
            $39 billion in 2020. In the 1990+24% case, with steadily increasing carbon prices,
            potential GDP declines relative to the reference case projections throughout the period
            and is $26 billion lower than the reference case levels in 2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">These three potential GDP
            trajectories represent a valuation of the possible loss in output in the economy in the
            absence of any cyclical influences brought on by price changes. As shown in Table 25, the
            three cases considered in this chapter reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 122, 325, and 485
            million metric tons a year on average between 2008 and 2012. <a href="pdf/c6graph2.pdf">Figure
              114</a> shows the relationship between the projections of carbon emission reductions and
            carbon prices. When the carbon reduction target is more stringent, the carbon price is
            higher; and for the most stringent targets, the projected carbon prices are
            disproportionately higher than those in the less stringent cases (i.e., the relationship
            is nonlinear). This curve can be used to measure losses to the aggregate economy by
            calculating the integral under the curve up to the level of the specified target case.
            Results for the 1990-3%, 1990+9%, and 1990+24% cases are shown in <a href="tbl28.html">Table
              28</a>. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1990+9% case results in an
            average reduction in carbon emissions of 325 million metric tons per year during the
            period from 2008 to 2012. The average carbon price projected for the same period is $144
            per metric ton (in 1992 dollars) (Table 25). The triangular area under the curve in Figure
            114, labeled A, represents the value of the carbon reduction to the economy&#151;i.e., the
            value of reduction in economic output that would result from higher energy prices. In the
            1990+9% case, the economic loss projected by the NEMS model totals $25 billion (Table 28).
            In comparison, the loss in potential GDP calculated by the DRI model over the same period
            is $32 billion. As a first approximation, this value closely matches the estimate of the
            value of the lost output calculated independently using the energy model results (<a href="pdf/c6graph2.pdf">Figure 115</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The curve shown in Figure 114
            can also be used to estimate the international value of traded permits. The carbon prices
            calculated in the NEMS model can be characterized as the particular penalties that the
            United States would be willing to pay to achieve a given carbon mitigation target. For
            example, in the 1990+9% case, U.S. carbon emission reductions average 325 million metric
            tons per year during the period 2008 to 2012. The difference between that reduction and
            the binding target of 485 million metric tons under the Kyoto Protocol (as reflected by
            the 1990-3% case) is assumed to be made up through purchases of international permits
            abroad. The value of those purchases is shown as the rectangle B under the curve in Figure
            114. For the 1990+9% case, this represents a transfer of $23 billion dollars (1992
            dollars) to purchase permits abroad. For the 1990+24% case, the transfer is $21 billion
            (Table 25). Even though more permits are purchased abroad, the purchases occur in&nbsp;the
            context of greater permit availability in the 1990+24% case, and the international price
            at which they are bought is projected to be dramatically lower, as shown in Table 25. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Focusing on the last two
            columns of Table 28 highlights the role of international permit trading. Potential GDP is
            a measure of the level of the output of the economy, but as the last column indicates,
            there now is a cost to the economy reflected in the transfer of funds abroad to buy
            permits. Although the direct cost to the U.S. economy in terms of lost potential GDP as a
            result of lower energy consumption would be less in the 1990+24% and 1990+9% cases than in
            the 1990-3% case, there would be additional losses of output available to the U.S. economy
            in those cases. Funds transferred abroad for purchases of international carbon emissions
            permits would, in effect, reduce the amount of potential GDP available for domestic use. </font></p>

            focuses on the possible transitional impacts on the aggregate economy that would result
            from efforts to reduce U.S. carbon emissions. The measurement of <i>actual</i> output for
            the economy, or actual GDP, is the key concept used in the examination of changes in the
            aggregate economy as it adjusts to its long-run path. In addition to internal frictions
            caused by wage-price interactions and capital stock obsolescence, losses in domestic
            income may occur as funds are transferred out of the United States to purchase
            
            international carbon permits. Resources may be less than fully employed, and the economy
            will move in a cyclical fashion as the initial cause of the disturbance&#151;the increase
            in energy prices&#151;plays out over time. Shifts in the sectoral composition of the
            economy would also accompany the adjustment process. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="2">Here, a single fiscal

            rebates. This is a stylized analysis in that it represents only one of a wide range of
            possible combinations of monetary and fiscal responses.</font><font size="2" face="Palatino"> </font></font></p>

            Energy Prices on the Economy</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As a direct consequence of the
            carbon price, aggregate energy prices in the U.S. economy are expected to rise. One way to
            measure this effect is to look at the percentage change in the <i>level</i> of prices in
            the economy. One measure that can be used is the calculated wholesale price index for fuel
            and power (<a href="pdf/c6graph2.pdf">Figure 116</a>). In the 1990-3% case, aggregate
            energy prices are projected to double by 2010 and then decline to 79 percent above
            reference case price levels in 2020. In the 1990+9% case, energy prices are 56 percent
            higher than the reference case projection in 2010 and remain more than 50 percent above
            the reference case over the rest of the forecast period. Prices in the 1990+24% case are
            22 percent higher than the reference case in 2010 and continue to rise to 33 percent in
            2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">These changes can also be
            expressed as rates of change. In the reference case, overall energy prices rise by 3.9
            percent per year between 2005 and 2010; however, in the 1990+9% case, aggregate energy
            prices rise at a rate of 13.5 percent per year, a difference of 9.6 percentage points. The
            1990-3% case shows a more dramatic rise, at 19.2 percent per year, and the 1990+24% case
            shows a rise of 8.0 percent per year. Over the longer run, measured between 2005 and 2020,
            the rise in energy prices is less dramatic, with the reference case growth at 4.2 percent
            per year and the 1990+9% case at 7.2 percent per year, a difference of 3.0 percentage
            points. For the 2005-2020 period, the 1990-3% case shows energy prices rising by 8.3
            percent and the 1990+24% case by 6.2 percent per year. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The projected energy price
            increases would also affect downstream prices for all goods and services in the economy.
            An intermediate measure is the producer price index (<a href="pdf/c6graph2.pdf">Figure 117</a>),
            which reflects price impacts on intermediate goods and services. The projected increase in
            producer prices relative to the reference case in 2010 is 16 percent in the 1990-3% case,
            9 percent in the 1990+9% case, and 4 percent in the 1990+24% case. By 2020, the prices in
            the three carbon reduction case begin to converge, as the differences in projected carbon
            prices narrow. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Final prices for goods and
            services in 2009, as shown by the consumer price index (CPI) series (<a href="pdf/c6graph3.pdf">Figure 118</a>), are more than 6.6 percent higher in the 1990-3%
            case than in the reference case, 3.7 percent higher in the 1990+9% case, and 1.4 percent
            higher in the 1990+24% case. Again, by 2020, the differences narrow considerably. In the
            reference case the CPI rises by 3.6 percent per year between 2005 and 2010, but in the
            1990+9% case, it rises at a rate of 4.3 percent per year, a difference of 0.7 percentage
            points. The 1990-3% case shows a more dramatic rise, at 4.8 percent per year, and the
            annual increase in the 1990+24% case is 3.9 percent. In the long term, between 2005 and
            2020, the increase in the aggregate price for all goods and services is less dramatic: 3.8
            percent per year in the reference case and 3.9 percent per year in the 1990+9% case, a
            difference of only 0.1 percentage points. Over the same period, the 1990-3% case projects
            a 4.0-percent annual increase in the CPI and the 1990+24% case a 3.9-percent annual
            increase. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">One aspect of the CPI is
            particularly noteworthy. The CPI measures the prices that consumers face, regardless of
            the country of origin of the product. Import prices, to the extent that they do not rise
            at the rate of domestic prices because non-Annex I countries do not face carbon
            constraints, would dampen the price effects as lower priced imports found their way into
            U.S. markets. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">These figures suggest the
            following rule of thumb for the year 2010. Each 10-percent increase in the level of
            aggregate prices for energy may lead to a 1.5-percent increase in producer prices and a
            0.7-percent increase in consumer prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Revenues Flows With
            International Permit Purchases</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The process of auctioning
            emissions permits would raise large sums of money. If permits were purchased from other
            countries, as is assumed in both the 1990+9% and 1990+24% cases, there would actually be
            two revenue flows&#151;domestic and international. The carbon permit revenues remaining
            within U.S. borders for each case are calculated as the carbon permit price for that case
            times the level of carbon emissions in the 1990-3% case. Thus, the number of carbon
            permits purchased domestically remains constant; only the price at which they are
            available varies across cases. Permits are assumed to be purchased abroad in order for
            U.S. carbon emissions to continue above the 1990-3% level. Therefore, the international
            revenue flow equals the difference between actual emissions in the 1990+9% (or 1990+24%)
            case and those in the 1990-3% case, times the carbon permit price in the 1990+9% (or
            1990+24%) case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 1990-3% case the United
            States attains the binding target level, and all the funds collected are kept within U.S.
            borders. The revenue collected in 2010 is projected to total $585 billion nominal dollars,
            calculated as the level of carbon emissions (1,305 million metric tons) times the carbon
            permit price ($266 in 1992 dollars), adjusted to nominal dollars. In contrast, in the
            1990+9% case, U.S. emissions are reduced to 1,467 million metric tons, or 162 million
            metric tons short of the binding target. The domestic portion of the collected revenues is
            equal to the binding target value of 1,305 million metric tons times the new, lower carbon
            permit price of $148 per metric ton in 1992 dollars. The remaining 162 million metric tons
            must be offset by permits purchased abroad, again valued at $148 per metric ton. <a href="pdf/c6graph3.pdf">Figure 119</a> shows total U.S. expenditures for carbon permits in
            the three carbon reduction cases, and <a href="pdf/c6graph3.pdf">Figure 120</a> shows the
            projected split between domestic and international flows for the years 2010 and 2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The total projected payments
            for carbon permits become substantially lower as the carbon reduction target moves from
            1990-3% to 1990+9% to 1990+24%. And, although the flow of funds overseas represents an
            increasing <i>proportion</i> of the total collected funds from the 1990+9% case to the
            1990+24% case, the actual level of the transfers is relatively stable. Under the
            domestic-only program of the 1990-3% case, the revenue from permits is assumed to be
            returned to U.S. households through income tax rebates. In the 1990+9% and 1990+24% cases,
            only the domestic portion of the funds would be recycled back to consumers. The
            international flow of carbon permit revenue is considered an increase in the purchase of
            imported services. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dynamics of Adjustment in
            an Economy With Frictions</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The ultimate impacts of carbon
            mitigation policies on&nbsp;the economy will be determined by complex interactions between
            elements of aggregate supply and demand, in conjunction with monetary and fiscal policy
            decisions. As such, any discussion of possible cyclical impacts on the economy is bound to
            be characterized by uncertainty and controversy. It should be recognized, however, that
            the process of raising the price of energy and downstream prices in the rest of the
            economy by the magnitudes shown in Figure 116, 117, and 118 could introduce cyclical
            behavior in the economy resulting in employment and output losses beyond those associated
            with the projected impacts on potential GDP. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The introduction of carbon
            emission limits would affect both consumers and businesses. Households would be faced with
            higher prices for energy and the need to adjust spending patterns. Nominal energy
            expenditures would rise, taking a larger share of the family budget for goods and service
            consumption and leaving less for savings. Higher prices for energy would cause consumers
            to try to reduce spending not only on energy, but on other goods as well. Thus, changes in
            energy prices would tend to disrupt both saving and spending streams. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Energy services also represent
            a key input in the production of goods and services. As energy prices increase, the costs
            of production rise, placing upward pressure on the nominal prices of all intermediate
            goods and final goods and services in the economy, with widespread impacts on spending
            across many markets. The ultimate effect will depend on opportunities for substitution
            away from higher-cost energy to other goods and services and the effectiveness of
            compensatory fiscal and monetary policy. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The transitional adjustment of
            the economy can be captured by calculations of the actual GDP of the economy. The impacts
            on actual GDP represent a measure of the loss of output from the economy, recognizing that
            adjustments are not frictionless and that all resources may not be fully employed in the
            near term. The output of the economy as reflected by actual GDP can cycle around the
            measure of potential GDP. </font></p>

                    not include all of these investment costs. The premature obsolescence of capital&#151;when

                    life&#151;is typically ignored or assumed to be costless, because estimates of the amount
                    of capital retired early are difficult to make. Estimates of the full cost of developing
                    new technologies, particularly the associated research and development costs, are
                    generally unavailable. In addition, certain new technologies may require a considerable
                    amount of additional investment in infrastructure in order to be widely adopted. For
                    example, widespread adoption of carbon-free vehicles (such as hydrogen fuel cell
                    automobiles) may require substantial investment to guarantee consumers that hydrogen
                    refueling stations are conveniently located and that the development of hydrogen stations
                    does not present safety risks. Estimates of these costs are difficult to obtain and are at
                    best uncertain. </font></p>

                    not include costs attributable to improving the energy efficiency of structures, such as
                    insulation and thermal windows. For generators, the investment costs include additional
                    expenditures on both equipment and structures required for generation, transmission, and
                    distribution of electricity. The NEMS representations of investment costs for generators

            Policy</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Monetary policy can moderate
            or intensify the ultimate impacts on the economy; however, trying to predict the response
            of monetary authorities to large increases in energy prices is a difficult task. The
            emphasis on controlling inflation relative to concerns about rising unemployment has
            changed over the past 20 years, and using history as a guide does not remove the large
            amount of uncertainty about the response of monetary authorities. In addition, the types
            of financial instruments available have become more numerous and more interdependent, and
            the task of monitoring the Nation&#146;s money supply has become more complex. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The monetary authorities could
            concentrate on increased inflation resulting from higher energy prices and choose not to
            increase the money supply in order to moderate the resulting inflation. In this instance,
            output and employment losses would be larger than they would if the money supply were
            expanded when energy prices increased. Another option would be to allow the money supply
            to increase in order to remove the unemployment impacts while allowing substantial
            additional price inflation. This analysis uses neither extreme of these assumptions about
            the response of the Federal Reserve. The discussion that follows represents a middle path
            that the Federal Reserve might follow. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the setting that has been
            described&#151;returning funds in the form of personal income tax rebates&#151;higher
            prices in the economy would place upward pressure on interest rates. The Federal Reserve
            Board would then seek to balance the consequences of higher energy prices on the economy
            with possible adverse effects on output and employment. The Federal Reserve would respond
            to changes in inflation and unemployment brought on by the initial carbon mitigation
            policy by making adjustments to influence the Federal funds rate.<a href="fnote2.html#83"><sup>83</sup></a> The adjustments would be designed to moderate the possible impacts on both inflation and
            unemployment, and to return the economy toward its long-run growth path. The
            characterization of monetary policy reactions to inflation and unemployment used in these
            simulations is based on a DRI reaction function that has been estimated to reflect the
            historical relationship between the Federal funds rate and changes in inflation and
            unemployment. As such, the reaction function is a reflection of how the Federal Reserve
            may react to changes in the economy caused by the carbon price, based on past behavior. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If the rate of inflation
            increases, but unemployment does not increase, the Federal Reserve may choose to let the
            nominal interest rate rise in an attempt to cut the rise in inflation. However, if this is
            accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate, the Federal Reserve may consider a
            cut in the rate to stimulate economic expansion and the demand for labor. In essence,
            there is a balancing game between the two factors&#151;inflation and unemployment&#151;as
            the initial originating policy initiative has uneven impacts on the two over time. <a href="pdf/c6graph3.pdf">Figures 121</a>, <a href="pdf/c6graph4.pdf">122, and 123</a> show
            the interrelationship between the projected inflation rate, unemployment rate, and Federal
            funds rate in the 1990+24%, 1990+9%, and 1990-3% cases. This assessment combines the
            monetary policy formulation described above with a fiscal policy that returns collected
            carbon permit revenues back to consumers. An alternative combination of fiscal and
            monetary policy is considered later in this section. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Focusing first on the 1990+9%
            case, the inflation rate jumps from 3.3 percent per year to 5.1 percent per year, a
            difference of 1.8 percentage points in 2005, the first year of the energy price rise, and
            continues to remain high for the first 4 years of the carbon reduction program. In the
            same 4-year period, the unemployment rate first responds slowly and then accelerates to a
            peak in 2009 that is more than a full percentage point above the reference case
            unemployment rate, rising from 5.6 percent in the reference case to 6.8 percent in the
            1990+9% case. The key point here is that the responses of inflation and unemployment are
            not symmetric over time. There is a lag between the two effects with output and employment
            effects lagging behind price effects. Prices rise in the economy in response to the
            initial energy price increase and then to secondary price effects as the costs of
            intermediate goods and services rise. Business, in response to rising prices and lower
            aggregate demand, absorbs the near-term output loss but eventually reduces its use of
            labor. The lag from initial price effects to ultimate output and employment losses can be
            a year or so. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As a result of the
            differential effects projected for inflation and unemployment during the years from 2005
            to 2008, the Federal Reserve is assumed to allow a modest rise in the Federal funds rate
            in the short term, when concern over inflation outweighs concern over GDP losses and
            unemployment. After the initial rise in energy prices, with the carbon price actually
            projected to fall after 2009, the inflation rate reverts to that projected in the
            reference case; however, aggregate output is still depressed, and unemployment in the
            economy remains above the reference case value. During this period, the Federal Reserve
            reacts by reducing the Federal funds rate, in order to combat the loss in output and
            employment in the economy. After 10 years, by 2015, both inflation and unemployment have
            returned to at or about reference case levels. The Federal Reserve again allows interest
            rates to rise to bring the economy back to its long-run growth path. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Impacts on Actual
            Output and Consumption</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 1990+9% case, potential
            GDP is projected to decline smoothly over time, leveling off to a steady-state value of
            approximately 0.35-percent loss in output for the economy (<a href="pdf/c6graph4.pdf">Figure
              124</a>). In contrast, actual GDP is buffeted about as the economy adjusts to the
            significant price pressures brought on by higher energy prices, losing approximately 2.5
            percent in real output by 2009. The loss in actual output can also be described in terms
            of the impacts on the growth rate for actual GDP. Between 2005 and 2010, actual GDP is
            projected to grow by 2.0 percent per year in the reference case. In the 1990+9% case, the
            growth rate slows to 1.6 percent per year, reducing growth in the economy over the same
            period by 0.4 percentage points. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">After 2010, although the
            economy is still below the reference case, actual GDP begins to cycle in response to
            energy prices. The economy cycles for two fundamental reasons. First, output effects lag
            price effects in the economy as consumers and businesses adjust to the price changes.
            Also, in the case considered, the rise in energy prices levels off dramatically by 2010,
            and inflation rates are actually lower than in the reference case, as shown in Figure 121.
            The interesting property of the two output concepts, actual and potential, is that they
            begin to converge by 2015, 10 years after the beginning of the initial impacts on the
            economy. By 2020 they have merged into a steady-state path. This suggests that while the
            economy may very well be on a long-run path that could yield a loss to the economy of
            about 0.3 percent if its potential output, there is the possibility that near-term impacts
            may be larger as the economy adjusts to its long-run trajectory. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The projected impacts on
            actual GDP in the 1990-3% case peak at a loss of 4.1 percent in 2009, but again rebound
            back toward and merge with the ultimate potential GDP impact measure of 0.55 percent (<a href="pdf/c6graph4.pdf">Figure 125</a>). The growth rate between 2005 and 2010 slows to
            
            1.3 percent per year, a reduction of 0.7 percentage points from the reference case growth
            rate of 2.0 percent. In the 1990+24% case, actual GDP shows a peak loss of 1.0 percent
            relative to the reference case in 2010, with no significant impact on the growth rate,
            then begins to return to its long-run potential GDP path. In this case, however, because
            the carbon price is still rising, the economy continues to show a slight divergence
            between actual and potential GDP in 2020, although the gap is significantly narrowed (<a href="pdf/c6graph5.pdf">Figure 126</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Beyond the aggregate impact on
            GDP, a significant change in the composition of final demand is projected in the carbon
            reduction cases (<a href="tbl29.html">Table 29</a>). In the 1990+9% case, consumption in
            2009 is projected to be 1.9 percent lower than projected in the reference case (<a href="pdf/c6graph5.pdf">Figure 127</a>). Returning the carbon permit revenues to
            households through personal income tax rebates moderates the impacts on disposable income
            in the economy, which, in turn moderates the adverse impact on purchases of consumer goods
            and services, and therefore the impact on the aggregate economy measured by actual GDP.
            Investment is more severely affected, with rising interest rates and a general loss in
            demand in the economy projected in the years immediately after the imposition of the
            carbon price (<a href="pdf/c6graph5.pdf">Figure 128</a>). In 2007, investment in the
            1990+9% case is projected to be 5.9 percent below the reference case projection. After
            2008, with lower interest rates, the economy begins to rebound as investment expands
            rapidly. By 2013, investment is above the reference case by 3.2 percent and is leading the
            recovery. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1990-3% case shows a
            pattern of adjustment similar to that projected in the 1990+9% case, except that the
            reaction in terms of both consumption and investment is more extreme, given the higher
            carbon price. Consumption reaches its lowest point in the year 2009 at 2.8 percent below
            the reference case. Thereafter, consumption returns to the reference case level in 2013
            and by 2015 is 0.8 percent above the reference case level. Investment is more volatile,
            falling to 9.1 percent below reference case levels by 2008. Again, with interest rates
            declining relative to the reference case after 2010, investment recovers rapidly and by
            2013 is 5.1 percent above the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 1990+24% case reflects a
            
            much smoother path for both consumption and investment. Consumption remains below the
            reference case throughout the period, but with a maximum loss of only 0.8 percent in 2010.
            The impact on investment, likewise, is more moderate than in the 1990-3% and 1990+9%
            cases, falling to 2.2 percent below the reference case in 2008. Thereafter, investment
            returns to the reference case level and essentially remains at that position for the
            remainder of the forecast period. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="pdf/c6graph5.pdf">Figure
            129</a> shows the projected impacts on consumption and investment in terms of growth rates
            between 2005 and 2010 and between 2005 and 2020. Between 2005 and 2010, consumption growth
            rates fall from 2.0 percent per year in the reference case to 1.9 percent in the 1990+24%
            case, 1.7 percent in the 1990+9% case, and 1.6 percent in the 1990-3% case. Investment
            shows a similar, but more pronounced profile, with growth declining from 2.9 percent per
            year in the reference case to 2.5 percent, 2.6 percent, and 2.2 percent in the respective
            carbon reduction cases. Slight variations in the order of the impacts&#151;the 1990+24%
            case at 2.5 percent and the 1990+9% case at 2.6 percent&#151;can be explained by the
            highly cyclical effects on investment, as shown in Figure 128. In the long run, as
            indicated by the projected growth rates between 2005 and 2020, growth in both consumption
            and investment returns to the reference case rates. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">These results indicate that,
            as a result of higher energy prices, the economy may absorb a near-term loss in output in
            response to higher inflation and a rise in the unemployment rate. However, with
            appropriate action on the part of the monetary authorities, these impacts could be
            mitigated, and in the long-term the economy could rebound. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The Role of Fiscal
            Policy</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This analysis assumes that
            revenues from carbon permits would be collected by the Federal Government, which would
            have a number of alternatives with regard to their disposition. The producers of
            carbon-intensive fuels could keep the permit revenues; or the Government could either use
            the revenues to reduce the national debt, return them to businesses through reductions in
            corporate income tax rates or increased business tax credits, return them to consumers
            through personal income tax rebates, or return them to both consumers and businesses
            through social security tax rebates. Each method of using the collected permit revenue is
            plausible, and each method would have a different economic impact. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Returning the funds to
            consumers through personal income tax rebates or returning them to consumers and
            businesses through social security tax rebates would work to ameliorate the short-term
            impacts on the economy by bolstering disposable income. Alternative fiscal policies, such
            as having the Federal Government use the funds to lower the Federal debt level, or a
            corporate income tax rebate, probably would result in larger near-term impacts, because
            disposable income and therefore consumption would fall by greater amounts. Conversely,
            policies that serve to shift the economy away from consumption toward investment may have
            greater long-term benefits in terms of expansion of the aggregate capital stock. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">All the projections discussed
            so far in this chapter have assumed a policy of returning carbon permit revenues to
            households through personal income tax rebates, using a lump sum transfer.<a href="fnote2.html#84"><sup>84</sup></a> To highlight the potential significance of an
            alternative fiscal regime this chapter next reviews the potential effects of a rebate of
            social security taxes that passes funds back to both employees and employers in equal
            amounts. The analysis of a hypothetical rebate of the social security tax is meant only to
            be descriptive of a tax measure that could have the effect of reducing price pressures in
            the economy by lowering business costs, while also accomplishing a partial compensation to
            consumers for the higher energy bills they would face. The two policies considered in this
            analysis&#151;the personal income tax rebate and the social security tax rebate&#151;are
            only meant to be representative of a set of possible fiscal policies that might accompany
            an initial carbon mitigation policy. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The fundamental difference
            between the two policies is in their treatment of business. On the employer side, the
            reduction in employer contributions to the social security system would lower costs to the
            firm and, thereby, moderate the near-term price consequences to the economy. Since it is
            the price effect that produces the predominately negative effect on the economy, any steps
            to reduce inflationary pressures would serve to moderate adverse impacts on the economy.
            The smaller impact on aggregate prices would also moderate the monetary policy reaction,
            as shown in <a href="pdf/c6graph6.pdf">Figures 130, 131, and 132</a>. In all the carbon
            reduction cases, the reaction of the Federal funds rate to the economic effects of higher
            energy prices would be less pronounced than projected under the assumption of a personal
            income tax reduction. Similarly, the social security tax option would moderate the
            potential impact on actual GDP in the carbon reduction cases (<a href="pdf/c6graph6.pdf">Figure
              133</a>), largely because of the cost-cutting aspects of lowering of the employer portion
            of the tax. Similar moderating effects would be seen for consumption (<a href="pdf/c6graph7.pdf">Figure 134</a>) and investment (<a href="pdf/c6graph7.pdf">Figure
              135</a>). Under both policies, the economy would eventually revert to a long-run path
            consistent with the path of potential output. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Sectoral Impacts</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Regardless of the effects of
            carbon mitigation policies on the ultimate level of the aggregate economy, there are
            
            likely to be impacts on the configuration of the sectoral output of the economy. This
            section describes one possible set of outcomes. While the results are very uncertain, they
            indicate the potential for differential impacts among industries, primarily as the result
            of four key factors: </font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">First, the direct impact of higher energy
              prices is a reduction in energy demand, particularly for coal with its high carbon
              content. The consequences are reductions in output from the mining sector and from all
              services connected to the production and distribution of coal. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Second, higher energy prices
              disproportionately increase the cost of production for energy-intensive industries. As
              energy price increases are passed along by industry through higher prices for their
              products, consumers will tend to substitute away from the relatively expensive
              energy-intensive products to less energy-intensive products and services. The consequences
              are reductions in gross output from the energy-intensive sectors of the economy,
              principally, chemicals and allied products; stone, clay, glass, and concrete; and primary
              metals. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Third, the changing composition of
              macroeconomic final demand will alter the composition of sectoral output. In the cases
              considered here, all the carbon permit revenues are assumed to be returned to consumers
              through personal income tax rebates, moderating the projected impacts on disposable
              income. Consequently, in percentage terms, consumer spending falls by less than GDP, while
              investment falls by more. This change in the composition of final demand decreases the
              output from consumer-related sectors, such as services and retail trade, by less than the
              average drop for all economic output, while decreasing the output from the construction
              and manufacturing sectors by more than the average. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, because the carbon emissions
              restrictions are placed only on Annex I countries, industries with high levels of imports,
              particularly those with imports from non-Annex I countries, will see larger reductions in
              domestic output than industries with low import penetration. If imports are already
              competitive, increasing the cost of production for the domestic industry and not for
              non-Annex I importers will tend to increase imports, leading to a drop in&nbsp;domestic
              output. For this reason, output from manufacturing sectors such as leather and leather
              products, electronic and other electrical equipment, and miscellaneous manufacturing will
              fall by more than the output for the manufacturing sector as a whole. </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is difficult, <i>a priori</i>,
            to predict the degree and rate of change of such effects. <a href="pdf/c6graph7.pdf">Figure
              136</a> shows the disaggregated impacts of restricting carbon emissions in the 1990+9%
            case. The upper part of the graph shows the projected growth rates for GDP, total gross
            output, and sectoral gross output for the major SIC divisions between 2005 and 2010. The
            GDP and total gross output growth rates provide an economy-wide frame of reference against
            which the sectoral growth rates can be&nbsp;compared. The lower part of the graph shows
            the growth rates for total manufacturing gross output and&nbsp;sectoral gross output by
            2-digit SIC breakdown between 2005 and 2010, with the growth rate for total manufacturing
            gross output as a reference. <a href="pdf/c6graph7.pdf">Figures 137 and 138</a> show the
            results for the 1990-3% and 1990+24% cases, respectively.</font></p>
