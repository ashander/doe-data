<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" ><a name="19" id="19">[19]</a> A permit
            auction system is identical to a carbon tax as long as the marginal abatement reduction
            cost is known with certainty by the Federal Government. If the target reduction is
            specified, as in this analysis, then there is one true price, which represents the
            marginal cost of abatement, and this also becomes the appropriate tax rate. In the face of
            uncertainty, however, the actual tax rate applied may over- or undershoot the carbon
            reduction target. Auctioning of the permits by the Federal Government is evaluated in this
            report. To investigate a system of allocated permits would require an energy and
            macroeconomic modeling structure with a highly detailed sectoral breakout beyond those
            represented in the NEMS and DRI models. For a comparison of emissions taxes and marketable
            permit systems, see R.&nbsp;Perman, Y. Ma, and J. McGilvray, <i>Natural Resources and
              Environmental Economics</i> (New York, NY: Longman Publishing, 1996), pp. 231-233. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font ><a name="22" id="22">[22]</a> The modeling approach assumes perfect foresight of carbon prices for capacity planning in
            the electricity industry. Perfect foresight, in this context, means that the carbon prices
            that are anticipated during planning are later realized. An algorithm solves for the path
            of carbon prices in which anticipated and realized carbon prices are approximately the
            same, while ensuring that the carbon prices clear the carbon permit market each year. In
            the end-use demand sectors, foresight is assumed not to have a material influence on
            energy equipment decisions, and such decisions are modeled on the basis of prices in
            effect at the time of the decision. </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" ><a name="23" id="23">[23]</a> A
            related factor influencing the effect of carbon prices on gasoline demand is that the
            price of gasoline already includes Federal and State excise taxes averaging 37 cents per
            gallon in 1996, equivalent to a carbon permit price of $155 per metric ton. When
            additional carbon permit prices are included in the delivered price of gasoline, the
            percentage increase in price is not as high as it would be if gasoline were untaxed
            initially. In turn, the percentage change in gasoline demand due to the carbon price is
            not as high as it would be if gasoline were not already taxed. </font></p>

            &#147;hurdle rate&#148; for evaluating energy efficiency investments has also been
            referred to as the &#147;implicit discount rate&#148; (i.e., the empirically based rate
            required to simulate actual purchases&#151;the one implicitly used). These rates are often
            much higher than would be expected if financial considerations alone were their source.
            Among the reasons often cited for relatively high apparent hurdle rates are uncertainty
            about future energy prices and future technologies, lack of information about technologies
            and energy savings, additional costs of adoption not included in the calculations,
            relatively short tenure of residential home ownership, hesitancy to replace working
            equipment, attributes other than energy efficiency that may be more important to
            consumers, limited availability of investment funds, renter/owner incentive differences,
            and builder incentives to minimize construction costs. For a good discussion of potential
            market barriers and the economics of energy efficiency decisions, see Jaffe and Stavins,
