<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

            employed, and the particular points of view embodied in the models.<a href="fnote2.html#91"><sup>91</sup></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Two cases were solicited for
            analyses from each group: a 7-percent-below-1990 (1990-7%) case in which the United States

            the benefit of sinks, offsets, international carbon permit trading, or the Clean

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because the information
            available varies considerably, a detailed comparison among the sources is virtually
            impossible. Therefore, a comparison of common variables is provided in this section, with
            an explanation for the differences between the sources. Comparisons are provided for three
            of the cases analyzed in this report: the 1990-7% case and two cases&#151;9 percent
            above&nbsp;1990 (1990+9%) and 14 percent above 1990 (1990+14%)&#151;that are comparable in
            some respects to the Annex I trading case. The variables compared are carbon price, change
            in actual gross domestic product (GDP) from the respective reference case in each study,
            actual and potential GDP loss, expenditures for purchases of carbon emission permits,
            change in carbon intensity from the respective reference case, and change in fossil fuel
            consumption. Tables 30 and 31 provide comparisons of the results for 2010 and 2020.
            Further details are provided in Appendix C. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For the WEFA study,
            comparisons are provided only with the 1990-7% case. For DRI comparisons are provided only
            for a trading case (Case 2). WEFA does not believe that sinks, offsets, or trading will be
            agreed upon and implemented before the target period of 2008 to 2012, nor by 2020. As
            noted earlier in the report, EIA does not have the capability to analyze international
            trading and thus is unable to provide a most likely estimate of the impacts of the
            international trading provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, or of sinks and offsets, on the
            level of the energy-related carbon reductions required to meet the 1990-7% reduction in
            greenhouse gases. EIA's 1990+9% and 1990+14% cases are used in Table 31, because the
            carbon emissions levels of those cases were most closely aligned with the other studies
            presented. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of the major factors that
            result in differences in the projected carbon prices and costs to achieve the 1990-7%
            carbon reduction level are: </font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Relative differences in reference GDP and
              carbon emissions growth rates through 2020.</b> For example, if the GDP or carbon
              emissions growth rate in a given reference case is lower than that in EIA's reference
              case, a smaller carbon reduction will be needed, and it will generally be easier to
              achieve the emissions target. If the reference GDP growth or carbon emissions growth is
              higher than in EIA's reference case, the carbon price and GDP impacts relative to those
              projected by EIA in this study will generally be higher. Most of the major differences
              among the analyses are attributable to differences in the reference case projections. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Differences in assumptions about the
              potential for economical life extension or refurbishment of existing nuclear power plants
              beyond their normal licensing period.</b> If, for example, no existing nuclear plants were
              retired by 2020, about 40 million metric tons of carbon emissions would be avoided from
              the combustion of fossil fuel used in plants to replace them.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The amount of knowledge about future
              events assumed for decisionmakers.</b> For example, models that assume that decisionmakers
              have perfect knowledge about future prices, demands, or policies could underestimate
              compliance costs, because all future events would be anticipated with certainty and
              responded to at minimum cost. Analyses that assume that all decisionmakers are myopic will
              tend to overstate transition costs. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The amount of lead time decisionmakers
              are assumed to have to adjust to the Kyoto Protocol.</b> For example, if a model starts to
              begin the adjustment process in 1985, 1990 or 1995, it could underestimate the costs of
              complying with the Kyoto Protocol, because it has more time to adjust. Models that wait
              until the last moment to begin the adjustments could overstate adjustment costs. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The level of aggregation in the model for
              technologies and goods.</b> A model that deals only with aggregate products such as oil,
              gas, or coal without the benefit of an explicit technology representation may not capture
              important variables that can significantly affect energy efficiency and intensity or the
              changing mix of industries that may result from compliance efforts. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The amount of focus on the transition
              process and the associated costs.</b> For example, a model that assumes that all capital
              and labor can be immediately switched from one use to another cannot capture the
              short-term or medium-term impacts of complying with the Kyoto Protocol, because those
              costs are not reflected in the model. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The assumed speed and extent of changes
              that consumers can make in energy consumption or demand for energy services in response to
              changing prices (price elasticities of demand).</b> Higher assumed elasticities make it
              easier to achieve the carbon target through demand reductions. Lower elasticities make it
              more difficult. </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Among the studies compared in <a href="tbl30.html">Table 30</a>, the projected carbon prices in 2010 fall into three
            groups. MIT, EPRI, CRA, and WEFA project prices in the range of $265 (WEFA) to $295 (CRA)
            per metric ton of carbon. PNNL projects carbon prices of about $221 per metric ton. EIA
            projects carbon prices of $348 per metric ton. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the PNNL study, assumptions
            about consumer price responsiveness (demand elasticities and capital/energy substitution
            elasticities) are consistent with a long-term time frame where everything is changeable.<sup><a href="fnote2.html#92">92</a>,<a href="fnote2.html#93">93</a></sup> Applying the long-term
            elasticities to the short-term andmidterm period can overstate the ease and willingness
            with which consumers change their equipment or reduce their consumption in response to
            price increases.<a href="fnote2.html#94"><sup>94</sup></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Further contributing to the
            low carbon price projection is the amount of lead time consumers have to respond, as well
            as differences in the reference case economic growth rates. The PNNL and EIA reference
            case GDP projections are very similar. However, PNNL's end-use representation does not
            explicitly represent technologies, and PNNL's assumed consumer responsiveness to prices
            (prompting lower energy service demand) and interfuel substitution potential appear to be
            substantially higher in the medium term (through 2010) than the implicit elasticities in
            EIA's explicit representation of technologies and consumer choices. The PNNL model begins
            solving in 1985 in 5-year increments. The PNNL reference case is calibrated to <i>AEO98</i>.
            In the PNNL policy runs, the carbon policy was phased in over a 10-year period beginning
            in 2000. Consequently, policy adjustments begin in 2001, consumers and producers begin to
            anticipate the Kyoto Protocol in that year, making the appropriate adjustments. In the
            PNNL analysis, electricity demand grows by 0.4 percent annually in the reference case
            between 2010 and 2020. This is a significant departure from the annual growth rate of more
            than 2 percent in recent years. Most electricity demand projections have annual growth in
            excess of 0.9 percent between 2010 and 2020, as compared with PNNL's 0.4 percent.<a href="fnote2.html#95"><sup>95</sup></a> Offsetting these factors are factors that tend to
            overstate cost. For example, in the PNNL analysis, primary renewable use for generation
            changes only slightly from the reference case in 2020, even with a carbon price of $286
            per metric ton. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The group of models projecting
            costs between $265 per metric ton and $295 per metric ton in 2010 for the 1990-7% case
            include transitional processes and costs&#151;either in the macroeconomy or in the energy
            system&#151;through a detailed representation of the cost, performance, and market
            adoption of technologies.<a href="fnote2.html#96"><sup>96</sup></a> This group includes
            the CRA model. Through 2010, CRA projects that, in the reference case, U.S. GDP will grow
            by $270 billion more than projected in most of the other studies compared. The higher
            growth rate of GDP normally makes the reduction in emissions harder and more costly to the
            U.S. economy. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If differences in the
            reference cases were the only factor accounting for the different estimates of the costs
            of complying with the Kyoto Protocol, then CRA's costs would exceed EIA's and WEFA's in
            2010; however, large econometric models of the U.S. economy like those of WEFA and DRI
            tend to focus on the transitional process, including the method of recycling any carbon
            fees that may be collected by the Federal Government, and unemployment that may be
            increased as a result of policy implementation. The WEFA, EIA, and DRI analyses assume
            that labor can be dislocated, whereas most other analyses assume full employment<a href="fnote2.html#97"><sup>97</sup></a> despite the sudden reduction of energy resources.
            More aggregated world analyses, including the CRA, PNNL, EPRI, and MIT studies, omit such
            details, because the inclusion of global regional coverage and trade flows requires
            simplifications (some important) in the detail with which each region is represented.
            Model aggregation tends to underestimate the macroeconomic costs; on the other hand, a
            lack of global coverage (as in the EIA, DRI, and WEFA models) may overstate transition
            costs, particularly if international trading is implemented efficiently. Also, fossil fuel
            consumption in 2010 in the CRA analysis is about 6 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu)
            less than in the EIA reference case, with virtually identical carbon emissions levels,
            suggesting an accounting difference in emissions coefficients. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because of the aggregation of
            sectors and outputs in the CRA analysis, CRA's analytical approach is likely to
            underestimate the costs of the Kyoto Protocol.<a href="fnote2.html#98"><sup>98</sup></a> In the CRA reference case GDP grows rapidly from 2010 to 2020, making it more difficult to
            comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990-7% case. Hence, the carbon price is projected
            to rise to $316 per metric ton in 2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">WEFA projects reference case
            GDP that is about 1.3 percent lower than EIA's in 2010 but then rises above EIA's by about
            $670 billion, or about 6 percent, by 2020. The difference in the carbon prices in 2010
            between the two studies ($265 per metric ton for WEFA and $348 per metric ton for EIA) is
            largely attributable to (1) a lower reference case GDP and lower emissions in the WEFA
            study, so that smaller reductions are needed to comply with the 1990-7% target, and (2)
            differences in the mix of fuels used in the reference case to generate electricity. WEFA's
            analysis projects less coal and more gas use for electricity generation than EIA's
            analysis, with basically the same electricity demands in 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 2020, the WEFA carbon price
            rises to about $360 per metric ton&#151;about $55 per metric ton higher than the EIA
            carbon price for the same case. The reason for this difference is based on three factors.
            Differences in the reference case GDP growth rates (WEFA's GDP grows much faster than
            EIA's from 2010 to 2020) lead to the need for higher fuel prices in the WEFA projection to
            comply with the 1990-7% case. WEFA assumes that nuclear life extensions would not be
            economical or feasible, whereas EIA allows economical nuclear refurbishments. WEFA
            projects that renewables cannot contribute significantly to electricity generation:
            renewable use for generation increases by only 11 percent in 2020 relative to the
            baseline, even with a carbon price&nbsp;of $360 per metric ton, whereas EIA projects a
            115-percent increase in the use of renewables for electricity&nbsp;generation in the
            1990-7% case relative to the EIA reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The EPRI analysis begins to
            react to the Kyoto Protocol in 1990, resulting in lower carbon prices and GDP losses than
            in the EIA analysis for 2010.<a href="fnote2.html#99"><sup>99</sup></a> Further, since the
            model does not have end-use technology detail, the rate of autonomous energy efficiency
            improvement is assumed as a policy lever and is based on the analyst's judgement or on
            calibration with other midterm, technology-rich models. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The pattern of carbon prices
            in the MIT study is similar to that in the EIA and EPRI studies. In the MIT analysis,
            decisionmakers do not see future prices or the impending Kyoto Protocol. In addition,
            capital stock is vintaged&#151;i.e., once capital is invested in equipment, that capital
            is sunk and the technology's efficiency and use cannot change during its survival period. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Carbon prices in 2020 for the
            1990-7% case are more evenly distributed among the studies, ranging between $147 per
            metric ton for MIT to about $360 per metric ton for WEFA. The declining carbon prices in
            the EPRI and EIA studies result from the projected increasing penetration of carbon-free
            or low-carbon generation technologies, coupled with greater selection of more efficient
            technologies that become economical with higher end-use fuel prices. MIT's carbon price in
            2020, $147 per metric ton, is the lowest because this study implicitly has greater
            optimism than EIA and EPRI that the economy will produce and adopt low-carbon or
            carbon-free technologies by 2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As already mentioned, the lead
            time that decisionmakers have to anticipate the Kyoto Protocol and the assumed
            responsiveness of consumers and equipment (demand elasticities and fuel substitution
            elasticities) can significantly affect the projections of how costly and difficult the
            transition will be. Most of the studies compared, with the exception of WEFA and EIA,
            allow the transitions to begin as early as 1990 or 1995.<a href="fnote2.html#100"><sup>100</sup></a> Since starting earlier allows consumers and producers to react earlier, the economy has
            more time to adjust to the Kyoto Protocol. This may result in an underestimation of the
            carbon prices and the midterm actual GDP losses to the economy that will be required to
            achieve the 1990-7% case.. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The CRA, WEFA, and PNNL
            studies exhibit a rising trend in the carbon prices required over time to maintain the
            1990-7% emissions target, because technological improvements do not occur quickly enough
            relative to demand growth. The technology-rich studies reach their peak carbon price in
            the early part of the compliance period, followed by a flat or declining carbon price to
            2020 as more efficient technologies are adopted. The relatively high energy prices make
            higher-efficiency and higher-cost equipment more competitive in the early part of the
            compliance period and give rise to normal learning through manufacturing experience, which
            helps to reduce equipment costs in the later part of the compliance period. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The other major area of
            disagreement among the projections is the impact on actual GDP. In 2010, actual GDP losses
            relative to each reference case range from -1.0 percent (EPRI) at the low end to about 4.2
            percent (EIA) at the high end. Some economists have noted that the total GDP impact on the
            U.S. economy of regulatory programs such as the Kyoto Protocol are large, and that the
            true costs typically exceed direct costs by a factor of two to four, particularly in the
            few years following implementation.<a href="fnote2.html#101"><sup>101</sup></a> CRA
            projects a 2.1-percent loss in GDP in 2010 and a 2.4-percent loss in GDP in 2020. This
            contrasts with the EIA projection of a 4.2-percent loss in GDP in 2010 and a 0.8-percent
            loss in 2020, a trend returning to the reference case GDP. The EIA projected recovery
            trend is due to declining real prices after 2012, whereas increasing GDP losses for CRA
            are due to continued increasing delivered energy prices throughout the projection period
            and the relative high GDP level in the reference case from which the reductions must be
            made. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Most of the reasons for the
            differences in carbon prices also contribute to the differences in GDP losses. For
            
            example, perfect foresight and long lead times allow the economy to adjust at minimum cost
            as in the PNNL, EPRI, and CRA models. In the WEFA analysis, lower GDP growth in the early
            period allows for lower carbon prices and smaller GDP losses relative to the EIA study.
            CRA's lower carbon price and smaller GDP losses are attributable to four factors: (1) the
            lack of representation of a revenue recycling mechanism, (2) the high level of aggregation
            of the U.S. energy-economy, (3) the length of the adjustment period, and (4) the
            incorporation of international trade flows. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The GDP losses portrayed in
            the analyses are not based on the same definitions. EIA, DRI, and WEFA report losses in
            potential GDP<a href="fnote2.html#102"><sup>102</sup></a> and full macroeconomic
            adjustment costs. CRA and EPRI report losses to potential GDP plus some but not all of the
            macroeconomic adjustment costs, because the level of aggregation used to represent the
            U.S. macroeconomy does not permit a full representation of the macroeconomic adjustment
            costs. PNNL reports only the direct cost of meeting the required commitment level, i.e.,
            losses in potential GDP. The loss in potential GDP can be estimated for all the studies
            except MIT and can be combined with payments for international permits to develop
            &#147;irreducible&#148; losses to the economy arising from compliance with the Kyoto
            Protocol for each of the two cases (no trading and Annex I trading).<a href="fnote2.html#103"><sup>103</sup></a> Estimates of irreducible losses to GDP in the
            1990-7% case in 2010 are remarkably close, ranging from $60 billion for WEFA to about $94
            billion for EIA (in 1996 dollars). The range of irreducible losses in 2020 is $75 billion
            for EIA to $130 billion for WEFA. WEFA projects the largest potential loss in 2020 because
            it has the highest carbon prices and its reference case projection of GDP in 2020 is one
            of the two highest. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The GDP comparisons imply that
            there is a great deal of uncertainty about the actual economic losses that could result
            from adherence to the Kyoto Protocol, with actual economic losses rising to as high as 4.2
            percent of reference case GDP in 2010&#151;particularly for analyses that use highly
            disaggregated representations of the U.S. economy (EIA and WEFA). The difference between
            actual losses and potential GDP losses represents macroeconomic adjustment costs, which
            are viewed by economists as <i>theoretically</i> reducible by optimal fiscal and monetary
            policies. This may be another factor leading to the wide variation in estimates of
            macroeconomic adjustment costs. Nevertheless, there is considerable agreement on the level
            of the potential GDP losses. </font></p>

            respectively). The carbon price projected in these cases ranges from $109 per metric ton

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Annex I trading cases,
            only the DRI and EIA analyses consider how the domestic funds will be recycled back to the
            economy. EIA assumed that the revenues from domestic sales of carbon emission permits
            would be recycled back to consumers through a personal income tax rebate, as described in <a href="economic.htm">Chapter 6</a>,<a href="fnote2.html#106"><sup>106</sup></a> and DRI
            assumes a return of funds to business. The DRI choice of returning the carbon revenues to
            business provides a significant boost to business investment in the economy, which implies
            higher business profits and lower real incomes for consumers in the medium term. According
            to the DRI analysis, returning carbon revenues to business ultimately would accelerate
            recovery and lead to stronger economic growth in the longer term than would recycling the
            carbon revenues to consumers. The impacts of the two recycling mechanisms account for most
            of the differences in macroeconomic results between the EIA and DRI analyses. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The DRI approach also phases
            in the carbon policy over a 10-year period (an approach necessitated by the structure of
            the DRI energy model), whereas EIA phases in the policy over a 3-year period. This factor
            adds to the difference between the EIA and DRI analyses of macroeconomic costs. In the DRI
            study, the 10-year phase-in and the assumption that consumers will anticipate and respond
            to the Kyoto Protocol early results in a smoother economic transition and tends to give a

            many frictions that can increase costs above the irreducible minimum. These include
            business cycles, international trade and capital constraints, regulation, use of imperfect

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The EPRI analysis, because of
            its perfect foresight and optimizing framework, yields actual GDP losses that are closest
            to its estimated unavoidable losses. CRA estimates actual GDP losses that are almost 3
            times its unavoidable losses in 2010, and estimated actual GDP losses in 2010 for the DRI
            and EIA 1990+14% cases are 3 to 4 times the unavoidable losses. Because DRI's and EIA's
            actual GDP losses are based on a detailed macroeconomic model that has limited foresight,
            focuses on the transitional process rather than the steady-state condition of the economy,
            their projected GDP losses are expected to be the largest and perhaps more appropriate in
            the mid term (through 2010). WEFA and EIA incorporate revenue recycling, while DRI
            redirects the revenues through higher profits to business. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The DRI and EIA analyses share
            the same DRI macroeconomic model; however, they differ in the way they represent the
            energy market. DRI uses a largely econometric approach, with some technology components to
            simulate equipment turnover. Responses of energy demand to energy prices are approximated
            through demand elasticities. Elasticity estimates can vary dramatically and are a major
            factor in determining results. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Because DRI and EIA share the
            same macroeconomic model, the reference case<a href="fnote2.html#108"><sup>108</sup></a> estimates of macroeconomic variables are nearly identical for 2010. The differences in the
            reference case energy projections are primarily due to differences in fuel prices. By
            2020, the differences between the DRI and EIA macroeconomic projections widen as
            differences in fuel prices widen. </font></p>

            more emissions domestically (325 million metric tons) than the 1990+14% case at an average
            carbon price of $159 per metric ton (peaking at $163 per metric ton) for the 2008-2012
            period. The unavoidable losses to the U.S. economy for 2010 are estimated to be slightly
            ($3 to $6 billion) more than in the 1990+14% case. The actual GDP losses are more than 3.5
            times the unavoidable losses in the EIA cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The carbon price in the two

            the EPRI, CRA, and DRI analyses that increase over the decade. Most of the reasons for
            these differences have already been described in the 1990-7% comparison case and will not
            be repeated here. However, one noteworthy difference remains&#151;the availability and
            cost of Annex I carbon permits and international trade. In the EPRI model, inexpensive
            permits are presumed to be available from Russia in the early part of the Kyoto Protocol
            implementation period but are assumed not to be available in the later part of the period.
            The elimination of the easy Russian permits makes it harder for the United States to meet
            its commitments in 2020 through Annex I trading and raises the carbon permit price by 65
            percent relative to 2010. The reason for the 60-percent increase in 2020 in the CRA carbon
            price is related to the differences in the representation of advanced technologies, the
            level of aggregation of the CRA model as previously discussed, and the absence of easy
            carbon permits from Russia. </font></p>

            not provide sufficient data to be included in Tables 30 and 31; however, the
            Administration asserts in Table 4 of the analysis (page 52) that under Annex I trading,
            the carbon price would be reduced by 72 percent and the resource cost would be decreased
            by 57 percent relative to a case in which all carbon reductions are achieved domestically.
            Using Tables 4 and 5 on pages 52 and 53 of the Administration's report on the Kyoto
            Protocol, the carbon price for the 1990-7% case can be calculated to be $192 per metric
            ton (in 1996 dollars), and the irreducible economic losses can calculated to be $60
            billion. When Annex I trading is assumed, the Administration projects that carbon prices

            case), and (3) the EIA case that focuses on advanced technologies (the 1990+9% high
            technology sensitivity case). By design, none of the Five-Lab Study scenarios results in
            carbon emissions that are below 1990 levels, because they were targeted to achieving
            stabilization at 1990 levels. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Five-Lab Study defines
            three scenarios: (1) an efficiency case, (2) a high efficiency/low carbon case with a $25
            per metric ton carbon price (25 HE/LC), and (3) a high efficiency/low carbon case with a
            $50 per metric ton carbon price (50 HE/LC). The efficiency case assumes better technology
            and improved cost competitiveness as compared to the business-as-usual case, as a result
            of additional government spending on R&amp;D and new, unspecified government programs and
            policies encouraging adoption of energy-efficient technologies. The HE/LC cases assume
            even more aggressive government spending, policies, and programs with regard to
            development and deployment of energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies. These cases
            assume that government policies and programs will be phased in gradually beginning in 2000
            and implemented by 2010, with a carbon price that begins in 2000 and rises until 2010. The
            two HE/LC cases differ only in the carbon prices assumed, one reaching $25 per metric ton
            in 2010 and the other $50 per metric ton. The Five-Lab Study focuses on the $50 per metric
            ton case because that analysis finds that carbon emissions can be stabilized at 1990
            levels by 2010. This case is equivalent to 5 percent above 1990 levels when adjusted for
            the carbon emission and economic baseline used in the EIA analysis. </font></p>

            Cases With the Five-Lab Study 50 HE/LC Case</b></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The principal factors that
            explain differences between the EIA cases and the Five-Lab Study results include (1) lower
            reference case economic growth (1.9 percent annually for the Five-Lab study versus 2.2
            percent annually for EIA) and carbon emissions growth (70 million metric tons lower in
            2010) than the EIA reference case; (2) a more aggressive menu of technologies in the 50
            HE/LC case than in either the 1990+24% case or the 1990+9% case, due to the assumption of
            aggressive R&amp;D; (3) a more aggressive consumer response&#151; assumed through changes
            to their purchase behavior for energy-efficient equipment and changes to energy
            conservation&#151;than has been seen historically, as the result of new, unspecified
            government policies; and (4) a non-integrated analysis, in which the feedback between
            markets is not captured and some double counting of benefits is probable. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As illustrated below,
            differences in the reference GDP and carbon emission growth rates can have an enormous
            impact on the difficulty or ease of achieving target carbon emissions, the carbon prices
            needed to achieve a carbon emissions target, and the emissions reductions achieved. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Comparison With the EIA
            1990+24% Case:</b> This comparison is made because the carbon prices are similar in the
            two cases ($60 per metric ton for EIA and $50 per metric ton for the Five-Lab Study.) At
            $67 per metric ton, EIA projects carbon emissions will be reduced by 123 million metric
            tons (7 percent relative to the reference case) in 2010. The Five-Lab Study projects a
            carbon emissions reduction of 395 million metric tons (23 percent) from its baseline in
            2010 at the carbon price of $50 per metric ton. EIA projects a GDP loss of about $14
            billion in 2010 and an annual 1.25-percent rate of decline in energy intensity from 1996
            
            to 2010. The Five-Lab Study estimates no GDP losses and an annual energy intensity decline
            rate of 2.0 percent. Although the EIA cases assume a dynamically changing menu of
            technologies, the differences in energy intensity result from the assumed penetration of
            even more efficient technologies in the Five-Lab Study due to the more aggressive
            technology assumptions and consumer behavior. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Comparison With the EIA
            1990+9% Case:</b> The EIA 1990+9% case reaches a carbon target of 1,467 million metric
            tons&#151;about 325 million metric tons below EIA's reference case&#151;in 2010. The
            Five-Lab Study 50 HE/LC case reduces carbon emissions by 396 million metric tons below the
            business-as-usual case. If the two studies had used EIA's reference levels of emissions in
            2010, then 1,416 million metric tons would have been the adjusted carbon emissions in the
            Five-Lab Study 50 HE/LC case. Nevertheless, the carbon price required in the EIA 1990+9%
            case is about $163 per metric ton, compared with $50 per metric ton in the Five-Lab Study.
            The combination of more advanced technologies and consumer behavior, coupled with a lower
            reference case economy and carbon emissions, allows the Five-Lab Study to achieve
            comparable carbon emission reductions at a much lower carbon price. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">GDP losses are estimated to be
            close to zero in the Five-Lab Study. GDP losses in the EIA 1990+9% case are estimated to
            be about 2.0 percent relative to the EIA reference case. GDP in the EIA 1990+9% case in
            2010 is about $80 billion above that in the Five-Lab Study' business-as-usual case.
            Consequently, a significant portion of the difference in the carbon prices required to
            achieve the respective carbon emission targets can be explained by differences in
            reference GDP and carbon emission levels. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Comparison With the EIA
            1990+9% High Technology Case:</b> In the 1990+9% high technology case, EIA's projected
            energy intensity reduction rate approaches 1.8 percent annually and requires a carbon
            price of $110 per metric ton. The technological progress assumed is roughly similar to
            that in the Five-Lab Study, but EIA's consumer decisionmaking remains unchanged. The
            annual rate of change in energy intensity, due primarily to technological change, in the
            50 HE/LC for 1996-2010 is about 2 percent per year, a rate that is historically
            unprecedented for any 14-year period when energy prices are relatively stable,
            illustrating the study's more aggressive assumptions about cost-effective technology and
            consumer behavior. Some of the assumptions of the Five-Lab Study that explain the major
            differences from the EIA results presented in this report are discussed below. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The following list identifies
            representative differences between the major assumptions between the EIA reference
            case&#151;a minor modification of the <i>Annual Energy Outlook 1998</i> (<i>AEO98</i>)
            reference case&#151;and those used for the Five-Lab Study. The EIA reference case assumes
            that current policies continue unchanged for the entire forecast period and that
            technology continues to evolve as represented by EIA's assessment of the best engineering
            estimates of their cost and performance during the forecast period. The Five-Lab Study is
            based on the assumption that technological advances are supported by various new
            governmental policies; therefore, it is expected that penetration rates of new
            energy-efficient technologies will generally be higher in the Five-Lab Study. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><i><b>Buildings Sector
            Assumptions</b></i></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Technological Optimism and
            Adoption:</b> The EIA reference case technology menu for the buildings sector improves
            over time in terms of both costs and efficiencies, including future technologies that are
            unavailable today. Market penetration is determined by economics and observed consumer
            behavior. For the commercial sector, available technologies are selected on the basis of
            annualized life-cycle costs and specified replacement equipment behavior rules (e.g., same
            fuel or no constraints). For the residential sector, technologies are selected on the
            basis of first cost and first-year operating cost, using observed market discount rates.
            The EIA reference case and carbon reduction cases use a distribution of implicit discount
            rates developed from observed consumer behavior, ranging from 15 percent to more than 200
            percent in real terms; energy-efficient investments must earn returns greater than these
            discount rates in order to be adopted by consumers. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Five-Lab Study 50 HE/LC
            case includes implementation of most of the cost-effective efficiency improvements, using
            a life-cycle cost calculation based on a 7-percent real discount rate for both the
            residential and commercial sectors. By assumption, in the Five-Lab Study 50 HE/LC case, 65
            percent of the cost-effective potential is achieved. The 7-percent discount rate implies
            that consumers on average are willing to wait about 15 years to get their payback on the
            incremental investments required to acquire more energy-efficient equipment. Currently,
            residential and commercial consumers tend to have payback periods of 6 months to 5 years,
            and residential homeowners tend to move about every 7 years. Further, the assumption that
            65 percent of all equipment that is cost-effective at a 7-percent discount rate is
            purchased assumes that dramatic changes will occur in consumer behavior as a result of
            government policy. Because the EIA cases assume no new government policies, these Five-Lab
            Study assumptions make a dramatic difference in the efficiency of equipment purchased in
            the buildings sector and in the carbon price required to achieve a specified carbon
            target. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Miscellaneous Electricity
            Growth:</b> In the EIA cases, miscellaneous electricity use in the buildings sector,
            measured in primary terms, grows at 2.8 percent per year from 1997 to 2010. In the
            Five-Lab Study, buildings sector miscellaneous electricity growth is 0.9 percent per year
            from 1997 to 2010 in the HE/LC cases. The difference is significant because it means that
            electricity demand is lower in the Five-Lab Study HE/LC cases than in the EIA cases,
            requiring a lower carbon price in the Five-Lab Study to achieve the target. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Light-Duty Vehicle Cost and
            Performance:</b> The EIA reference case achieves a new car efficiency of 30.6 miles per
            gallon by 2010. In EIA's 1990+24% case, with a carbon price of $67 per metric ton, new car
            efficiency increases to about 32.0 miles per gallon in 2010. In comparison, new car
            efficiencies reach 50.2 miles per gallon in the Five-Lab Study HE/LC cases. The Five-Lab
            Study achieves the higher efficiency by reaching 73-percent diesel penetration, 11-percent
            electric hybrid penetration, and a small penetration of fuel cell vehicles by 2010. The
            Five-Lab Study higher efficiencies and penetration rates were achieved through a variety
            of assumptions: (1) a major breakthrough of diesel NO<sub>x</sub> catalysts was assumed;
            (2) the characteristics of advanced diesel vehicles (vehicle price, vehicle range, fuel
            availability, commercial availability, etc.) were assumed to be the same as those of
            gasoline vehicles and to be accepted by consumers; (3) the incremental costs of advanced
            vehicles were assumed to be substantially lower than those in the EIA cases; and (4) with
            a price increase of 12.5 cents per gallon, consumers were assumed to prefer vehicles with
            much lower horsepower in the Five-Lab Study in 2010 (182 horsepower) than projected in the
            EIA cases (258 horsepower). </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Model Methodology and
            Calibration:</b> For the Five-Lab Study, the Long-Term Industrial Energy Forecasting
            (LIEF) model was calibrated to yield <i>AEO97</i> results for the business-as-usual case.
            Variations from the business-as-usual case involved changing two major assumptions in the
            LIEF model. For the HE/LC cases, the capital recovery factor (the implicit discount rate
            used to evaluate investment alternatives) was reduced from 33 percent to 15 percent, and
            the market penetration factor (the rate at which cost-effective investments are
            undertaken) was doubled from 3 percent to 6 percent. Both assumptions accelerate adoption
            of advanced technologies in the Five-Lab Study. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Additional Assumptions:</b> The HE/LC cases in the Five-Lab Study included additional reductions of 31 million metric
            tons of carbon-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, based on results that were not part of
            
            the LIEF modeling exercise. The additional reductions included 14 to 24 million metric
            tons from advanced turbine systems and 12 to 16 million metric tons of biomass and black
            liquor gasification, cement clinker replacement, and aluminum technologies. The cement
            clinker replacement and advanced aluminum production cells were assumed to reduce
            emissions by 1 to 2 million metric tons and 3.5 million metric tons of carbon equivalent,
            respectively, by 2010. These technologies were not included in the EIA cases. </font></p>

            Assumptions</b></i></font><font size="3" face="Helvetica"> </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Electricity Competition:</b> In each of the Five-Lab Study cases, greenhouse gas emission reductions in the
            utility&nbsp;sector result from lower electricity demand in the end-use sectors, the
            assumed deregulation of the electric power industry, an assumed carbon permit trading
            price of $50 per metric ton, and utility supply-side assumptions for fossil, nuclear, and
            renewable technologies. The Five-Lab Study assumes competitive prices in 2010 in all
            
            regions. The competitive pricing assumption tends to raise the price of electricity
            relative to the regulated cost-of-service price when a carbon price is applied to the
            carbon content of the fuels. The EIA reference case assumes competitive prices in 2010 in
            only three regions&#151;New York, California, and New England. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Electricity Demand Growth:</b> In the EIA reference case, electricity demand is expected to grow by 1.6 percent per year
            from 1996 to 2010. In the EIA carbon reduction cases, electricity demand initially falls
            in response to higher electricity prices and then recovers as more efficient units are
            constructed and brought on line to displace uneconomical units. In the Five-Lab Study 50
            HE/LC case, electricity demand is assumed to grow by just 0.2 percent per year. In 2010,
            total electricity demand in the 50 HE/LC case is 17 percent lower than in the EIA
            reference case.<a href="fnote2.html#113"><sup>113</sup></a> The lower electricity demand
            growth in the Five-Lab Study results from its estimates of efficiency improvements in the
            end-use sectors and lower growth for new electricity uses. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Coal Retirements:</b> The
            EIA reference case determines when and if any generation plants should be retired based on
            economics. In the Five-Lab Study, external assumptions are used in the business-as-usual
            and HE/LC cases to determine whether coal plants should be retired and whether coal units
            should be co-fired with biomass. In the 50 HE/LC case, 75 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity
            was assumed to be retired by 2010. In the EIA 1990+24% case, only 2.5 gigawatts of coal
            capacity and about 30 gigawatts of oil and gas steam were economically retired by 2010. In
            the EIA analysis, a carbon price of $50 per metric ton is insufficient to cause
            large-scale retirements of coal plants and replacement by natural-gas-fired advanced
            combined-cycle plants. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>An Integrated Estimate of

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The U.S. Environmental
            Protection Agency, Office of Atmospheric Programs, contracted with Lawrence Berkeley
            Laboratory to modify the <i>AEO98</i> version of the National Energy Modeling System to
            
            analyze the technology and policy assumptions of the Five-Lab Study within an integrated
            accounting system.<a href="fnote2.html#114"><sup>114</sup></a> Substantial modifications
            were made to the NEMS to model the variations of the Five-Lab Study. For example, the NEMS
            demand models were used as an accounting tool to represent the aggressive research and
            development program that facilitates adoption of energy-efficient technologies in the
            Five-Lab Study. Major assumptions regarding the retirement of fossil fuel units were
            implemented manually in the NEMS electricity module to make room for advanced, low-carbon
            technologies. The NEMS integrated framework was retained so that interactions between the

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The EPA/LBNL study analyzes
            two of the Five-Lab Study cases: a high efficiency/low carbon case with a carbon price of
            $23 per metric ton and a high efficiency/low carbon case with a carbon price of $50 per
            metric ton. All the technology and behavioral assumptions in the Five-Lab Study, with a
            few exceptions listed below, were adopted by the EPA/LBNL study. A scenario approach was
            used to determine the impact of each major group of assumptions. </font></p>

            (1) the hurdle rates assumed in the residential and commercial sectors were reduced from
            the <i>AEO98</i> baseline to 15 and 18 percent, respectively, instead of 7 percent in the
            Five-Lab study&#151; roughly matching energy consumption in the HE/LC cases in the
            Five-Lab Study; (2) 16 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity and 100 gigawatts of oil- and
            gas-fired steam were retired by 2008, whereas the Five-Lab Study retired about 75
            gigawatts of older coal plants and repowered an additional 45 gigawatts of coal plants as
            combined-cycle units; (3) cogeneration capacity was increased between 2000 and 2010 by 35
            gigawatts instead of the 42 to 51-gigawatt capacity increase assumed in the 50 HE/LC case
            of the Five-Lab Study; (4) wind received an extension of the renewable tax credit of 1.5
            
            cents per kilowatthour rather than assuming the penetration of wind in the Five-Lab Study;
            and (5)power plant efficiencies were not improved relative to the baseline, unlike the
            Five-Lab Study. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The EPA/LBNL preliminary
            results indicate that, when all the efficiency and capacity improvements, fossil
            generation retirements, other technology enhancements, electricity demand reductions, and
            behavioral assumptions are used simultaneously with a carbon price of $50 per metric ton,
            carbon emissions can be reduced in 2010 to 1,491 million metric tons (11 percent above
            1990) and 1,461 million metric tons (9 percent above 1990) in 2020. Energy intensity
            declines by a projected annual rate of 1.9 percent in this case. In comparison, the EIA
            1990+9% high technology case yields the equivalent carbon emissions with an energy
            intensity decline rate of -1.78 percent and a carbon price of $110 per metric ton but
            without the additional behavioral assumptions used in the EPA/LBNL analysis.</font></p>
