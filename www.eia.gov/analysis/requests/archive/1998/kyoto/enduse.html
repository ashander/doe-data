<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >This chapter provides in-depth
            
            analyses of the carbon emissions reduction cases for the four end-use demand
            sectors&#151;residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation. Additional analyses
            are included for a number of alternative cases, including low and high technology
            sensitivity cases, which have the most direct impacts on energy end use. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Primary and Delivered
            Energy Consumption</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In each of the reduction
            cases, carbon emissions are reduced through a combination of switching to carbon-free or
            lower-carbon fuels, reductions in energy services, and increased energy efficiency. The
            latter two options lower total energy consumption (<a href="pdf/c3graph1.pdf">Figure 25</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Electricity generation
            typically consumes about three times as much energy, on the basis of British thermal units
            (Btu), as is contained in the electricity delivered to final consumers. In <i>AEO98</i>,
            total delivered energy consumption in 1996 is estimated at 70.4 quadrillion Btu, compared
            with total primary energy consumption of 94.0 quadrillion Btu (<a href="tbl3.html">Table 3</a>).
            The difference comes from electricity-related generation and transmission losses and,
            consequently, is relatively small for the transportation sector, where little electricity
            is consumed. Although the delivered price of electricity per Btu generally is more than
            three times the delivered price of other energy sources, the convenience and efficiency of
            electricity use outweigh the price difference for many applications. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because consumers base their
            fuel and equipment choices on performance at the point of use, the analysis of end-use
            energy consumption presented in this chapter focuses on energy delivered to final
            consumers. When consumers choose to purchase a particular type of energy-consuming
            equipment or to use a particular fuel, their decisions are based on the cost and
            performance characteristics of the technology, mandated efficiency standards, and energy
            prices. End-use energy prices include all the direct costs of providing energy to the
            point of use. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The distinction between
            end-use and primary energy consumption is an important one for the evaluation of
            efficiency standards and other energy policies. Reducing electricity demand through the
            use of more efficient technologies reduces primary energy consumption by a factor of
            three. In addition, although electricity at its point of use produces no carbon emissions,
            reductions in electricity use produce savings in emissions from the fuels used for its
            generation. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Integrated Energy Market
            Analysis</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The analysis in this report is
            a fully integrated analysis of U.S. energy markets, representing the interactions of
            energy supply, demand, and prices across all fuels and sectors. For example, initiatives
            to lower energy consumption may lower the prices of the energy supplied, causing some
            offsetting increase in energy consumption. An integrated market analysis can capture such
            feedback effects, which may be missed in an analysis that focuses on end-use demand for
            energy without accounting for impacts on energy prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The Energy Information
            Administration&#146;s <i>Annual Energy Outlook 1998</i> (<i>AEO98</i>), includes results
            from a number of alternative sensitivity cases in addition to its reference case
            projections. Sensitivity cases generally are designed by varying key assumptions in one of
            the demand, conversion, or supply modules of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS),
            in order to isolate the impacts of the revised assumptions. For example, the high
            
            technology sensitivity cases for the end-use demand sectors in <i>AEO98</i> do not include
            any feedback effects from energy prices, and energy consumption in each sector is lower
            than in the reference case solely due to the revised assumptions about technology costs
            and efficiencies. The sensitivity cases described in this report, in contrast, were
            combined into an integrated analysis. As a result, lower energy consumption in the high
            technology case leads to lower energy prices, which in turn produce some offsetting
            increases in consumption. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Carbon emission reduction
            targets and carbon prices further complicate the integrated market analysis. In the high
            technology sensitivity cases presented in this chapter, the carbon reduction targets are
            the same as those in the comparable cases that use the <i>AEO98</i> reference case
            technology assumptions. For example, the 9-percent-above-1990 (1990+9%) case and the
            1990+9% high technology sensitivity case have the same carbon emissions target. The effect
            of the high technology assumptions is to lower the projected carbon price that would be
            required to achieve the same level of carbon emissions, which also reduces the delivered
            price of fuel. With lower carbon prices, adverse impacts on the macroeconomy and on energy
            markets are moderated. Assuming that the technological advances posited in the high
            technology cases for the various end-use sectors could in fact be achieved, energy
            consumption levels would not necessarily be lower in each sector. Rather, the carbon price
            would be lower, and it would be less costly to achieve a given emissions reduction target. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="4" ><a name="residential" id="residential"></a><b>Residential Demand</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Background</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >As the largest
            electricity-consuming sector in the United States, households were responsible for 20
            percent of all carbon emissions produced in 1996, of which 63 percent was directly
            attributable to the fuels used to generate electricity for the sector. Electricity is a
            necessity for all households, and with electricity use per household growing at 1.5
            percent per year since 1990, the projected increase in residential sector electricity
            consumption has become a central issue in the debate over carbon stabilization and meeting
            the goals of the Kyoto Protocol. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The number of occupied
            households is the most important factor in determining the amount of energy consumed in
            the residential sector. All else being equal, more households mean more total use of
            energy-related services. From 1980 to 1996, the number of U.S. households grew at a rate
            of 1.4 percent per year, and residential electricity consumption grew by 2.6 percent per
            year. In the reference case, the number of households is projected to grow by 1.1 percent
            per year through 2010, and residential electricity consumption is projected to grow by 1.6
            percent per year. Strong growth in the South, which features all-electric homes more
            prominently than do other areas of the country, and the advent of many new electrical
            devices for the home have significantly contributed to high electricity growth since 1980.
            Although these trends are projected to continue through 2010, efficiency
            improvements&#151;due in part to recent Federal appliance standards, utility demand-side
            management programs, building codes, and nonregulatory programs (e.g., Energy
            Star)&#151;should dampen electricity growth somewhat as residential appliances are
            replaced with newer, more efficient models. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Within the residential sector,
            all of the major end-uses (heating, cooling, lighting, etc.) are represented by a variety
            of technologies that provide necessary services. Technologies are characterized by their
            cost, efficiency, dates of availability, minimum and maximum life expectancies, and the
            relative weights of the choice criteria&#151;installed cost and operating cost. The ratio
            of the weight of installed cost to that of operation cost gives an estimate of the
            &#147;hurdle rate&#148; used to evaluate the energy efficiency choice<a href="fnote1.html#24">.<sup>24</sup></a>When more emphasis is placed on installed cost,
            the hurdle rate is higher. The hurdle rates for residential equipment range from 15
            percent for space heating technologies to more than 100 percent for some water heating
            applications. The range in part reflects differences in the way consumers purchase the two
            technologies. In the case of water heaters, for example, purchases tend to occur at the
            time of equipment failure, which tends to restrict the choice to equipment readily
            available from the plumber. Space conditioning equipment, on the other hand, is not used
            all year round, allowing some latitude in terms of timing the replacement of an older
            unit. It is assumed that residential consumers expect future energy prices to remain at
            the current level at the time of purchase when calculating the future operating cost of a
            particular technology. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Technological advances and
            availability play a large role in determining future energy savings and carbon emission
            reductions. Even in today&#146;s marketplace, there exist many efficient technologies that
            could substantially reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, however the relatively
            high initial cost of these technologies restricts their widespread penetration. Over time,
            the costs of more advanced technologies are assumed to fall as the technology matures, one
            example being natural gas condensing water heaters. In addition, technologies that are not
            available today but are nearing commercialization are assumed to become available in the
            future. Three technology menus are used in the analysis below: a reference technology
            menu, a high technology menu (reflecting more aggressive research and development), and a
            &#147;frozen&#148; menu limited to equipment available today. In all cases, the menu
            options and characteristics are fixed. In the high technology sensitivity case, for
            example, the cost of a condensing natural gas water heater is assumed to fall by almost 75
            percent by 2005, relative to the reference case, and a natural gas heat pump water heater
            becomes available for purchase, by 2005. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In response to energy price
            changes, residential elasticities, defined as the percent change in energy consumed with a
            1-percent change in price, range from -0.24 to -0.28 in the short run, depending on the
            fuel type, to -0.33 to -0.51 in the longer term. The elasticities reported here are
            derived from NEMS by a series of simulations with only one energy price varying at a time,
            beginning in 2000.<a href="fnote1.html#25"><sup>25</sup></a>These price elasticities
            reflect changes in both the demand for energy services and the penetration rate of more
            efficient technologies. In the absence of energy price changes, energy intensity, as
            defined as delivered energy consumption per household, declines at an average rate of 0.5
            percent per year through 2010. This non-price-induced intensity improvement reflects the
            efficiency gain brought about by ongoing stock turnover, equipment standards, new housing
            stock, and the future availability of new technologies. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Energy consumption, including
            the combustion of various fossil fuels, is the major source of U.S. carbon emissions.
            Energy use in the residential sector is greatly affected by year-to-year variations in
            seasonal temperatures, particularly in the winter, as illustrated by the decline in
            delivered energy use in 1990 (<a href="pdf/c3graph1.pdf">Figure 26</a>), which was one of
            the warmest winters on record. The projections in this analysis assume normal seasonal
            temperatures over the 1996-2020 forecast period. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the 3-percent-below-1990
            (1990-3%) carbon reduction case, which assumes an emissions target of 3 percent below 1990
            levels for the United States, a sharp drop in residential energy use is projected between
            2005, when the target is implemented, and 2010 (Figure 26). However, the projected decline
            is nearly identical to that seen historically from 1978 to 1983, in terms of both
            consumption and intensity (<a href="pdf/c3graph1.pdf">Figure 27</a>). Housing starts, a
            major predictor of residential energy use, fell from 2.02 million units in 1978 to 1.062
            million in 1982.<a href="fnote1.html#26"><sup>26</sup></a> The drop in housing starts was
            tied directly to mortgage rates, which increased from 9.6 percent in 1978 to over 16
            percent in 1981-1982. In addition, real energy prices to the residential sector increased
            by 87 percent from 1978 to 1982, similar to the 82-percent real price increase projected
            in the 1990-3% case. In the carbon reduction cases, delivered energy consumption in the
            residential sector never reaches its 1990 level, which has been used as a benchmark in
            setting carbon reduction targets. Given the uncertainty regarding technology and consumer
            behavior in a high-price energy world, additional sensitivities are examined here to
            analyze the effects of variations in the level of optimism associated with assumptions
            about both technology advances and consumer responsiveness. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Carbon Reduction Cases</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Carbon emissions associated
            with electricity generation are the largest component of emissions from the residential
            sector, in terms of both the levels and projected growth in the reference case, and in
            terms of&nbsp;the projected declines in the carbon reduction cases. In the reference case,
            which does not include the Kyoto&nbsp;Protocol, 98 percent of the projected increase
            in&nbsp;residential sector carbon emissions by 2010 results from increasing electricity
            use and the fuels used for electricity generation. In the 1990+9% case, 87 percent of the
            sector&#146;s decline in carbon emissions is related to reduced electricity demand and
            changes in electricity generation (<a href="pdf/c3graph1.pdf">Figure 28</a>). The
            following discussion focuses on the results of three carbon reduction cases&#151;1990-3%,
            1990+9%, and 24-percent-above-1990 (1990+24%)&#151;in which carbon emissions, averaged
            across all energy sectors, reach targeted levels relative to 1990 in the 2008-2012 period. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Although the use of
            electricity contributes most to the projected growth in emissions in the residential
            sector, natural gas consumption, which emits relatively low levels of carbon per Btu
            burned compared with coal (the major fuel used to generate electricity), is projected to
            remain the most important fuel in the sector as measured by delivered energy. <a href="pdf/c3graph2.pdf">Figure 29</a> shows delivered energy consumption by major fuel as
            well as the losses associated with electricity generation. On a delivered basis, natural
            gas use is projected to decrease the most in the three carbon reduction cases by 2010.
            Relative to the projected level of consumption in the reference case in 2010, delivered
            energy consumption is projected to be 10 percent lower in the 1990+9% case and
            electricity-related losses 22 percent lower. Of the 2.0 quadrillion Btu savings in
            electricity-related losses in 2010 in the 1990+9% case, 43 percent (0.9 quadrillion Btu)
            can be attributed to reduced electricity demand in the residential sector. The remaining
            1.1 quadrillion Btu (57 percent) of the savings in electricity-related losses comes from
            efficiency gains and/or fuel switching for electricity generation. Thus, changes in
            electricity supply, absent any major technological or behavioral changes in residential
            end use over the next 12 years, are the key to controlling carbon emissions for the
            residential sector. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Energy is used in the
            residential sector to provide a number of different services, which vary in end-use
            intensity (energy consumption per household) (<a href="pdf/c3graph2.pdf">Figure 30</a>).
            Space conditioning (which includes heating, cooling, and ventilation) is clearly the most
            energy-intensive end use in the sector, and it accounts for most of the direct use of
            fossil fuels. &#147;White goods&#148; (which include refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers,
            clothes washers and dryers, and stoves), lighting, and other uses are almost entirely
            powered by electricity and, therefore, are responsible for most of the electricity-related
            losses. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the reference case, most of
            the projected growth in residential energy consumption between 1996 and 2010 comes from
            increasing use of miscellaneous electric devices, such as personal computers and home
            security systems (<a href="pdf/c3graph2.pdf">Figure 31</a>). The rate at which energy
            consumption changes over time depends on factors such as equipment turnover rates, ability
            to control unit operation (thermostatic controls), energy prices, household size (people
            per house), housing unit size (square feet), and the efficiency of newly purchased
            appliances. Stock turnover can provide drastic reductions in energy intensity, even
            without future gains in appliance efficiency. On average, a new refrigerator purchased in
            1995 used 62 percent less electricity than one purchased 20 years earlier.<a href="fnote1.html#27"><sup>27</sup></a>Conversely, slow stock turnover can limit the role
            of energy efficiency gains in the future. Equipment purchased in the 1990s that lasts 20
            years or more will not be eligible for replacement until after 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >With the exception of white
            goods, increases in total energy consumption for all the major residential energy services
            are projected from 1996 to 2010 in the reference case. The negative growth in total energy
            consumption for white goods results from a decline in energy use for refrigeration, as
            aggressive Federal efficiency standards<a href="fnote1.html#28"><sup>28</sup></a> taking
            effect in 1993 and 2001 reduce the amount of energy needed to provide the same level of
            service. In the carbon reduction cases, increasing energy prices act to reduce the growth
            in energy consumption for all major services relative to their growth in the reference
            case. In the absence of mandatory standards, residential consumers traditionally have been
            reluctant to purchase highly efficient appliances. However, faced with the higher energy
            prices projected in the carbon reduction cases, it is expected that consumers will respond
            by purchasing more efficient appliances (<a href="tbl4.html">Table 4</a>). The extent of
            consumer response and its impact on average equipment efficiencies would also depend on
            the purchase price of the new equipment (the initial investment required). </font></p>

            real (inflation-adjusted) prices of electricity and natural gas to residential consumers
            are projected to decline between 1996 and 2010 (<a href="pdf/c3graph2.pdf">Figure 32</a>),
            by 8 and 10 percent, respectively. The outlook for prices in the carbon reduction cases,
            however, is much different. Without major changes in energy policy, technology, or
            consumer response, prices to the residential sector are expected to be as much as 94
            percent higher in 2010 in the 1990-3% case. In response to the higher prices, total
            residential energy consumption is projected to decline by more than 20 percent by 2010 in
            the 1990-3% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The factors that contribute to
            lower consumption include behavioral responses, such as adjusting the thermostat or

            more efficient appliances. The rate of improvement in average appliance efficiency is
            constrained by the rate of stock turnover. For example, it is not uncommon for major
            energy-using appliances, such as furnaces, to last for 30 years or more. More immediate
            responses to higher energy prices can be achieved through retrofits to improve the thermal
            efficiency of building shells. During the energy price shocks of the 1970s, for example,
            homeowners increased insulation levels substantially,<a href="fnote1.html#29"><sup>29</sup></a> with the immediate effect of conserving energy and lowering energy bills. The potential
            for similar improvement between 1996 and 2010 is reduced, given the improvements already

            Technology</strong>. Technology improvements over time can take the form of increased
            efficiency, decreased cost, or both. To examine the effects of assumptions about the rate
            at which technologies will improve in the future, two sets of sensitivity cases were
            analyzed. The low technology sensitivity cases assume that none of the improvements
            assumed in the reference case will occur. In other words, future technologies are assumed
            to be &#147;frozen&#148; at their 1998 cost and efficiency levels. Technological
            improvement occurs in this case as older units are retired and are replaced with 1998
            technologies. Engineering technology experts were consulted to develop the high technology
            case, which assumes more rapid advances than those in the reference case, due to research
            and development (<a href="tbl5.html">Table 5</a>).<a href="fnote1.html#30"><sup>30</sup></a> In the high technology case, for example, the efficiency of the best available natural gas

            pumps. The cost of the unit and the placement of the ground loop have been major barriers
            to wide market acceptance, however. Different levels of stocks of ground-source heat pumps

            case low and high technology cases (<a href="pdf/c3graph3.pdf">Figure 33</a>). Given that
            significant market acceptance is seen only in the high technology case, it can be
            concluded that the costs associated with the technology restrict its acceptance. Space
            heating technologies, in general, have the lowest hurdle rates (15 percent) of all

            technology to penetrate the market, one would expect that over a longer period of time,
            the prices in the high technology sensitivity would fall relative to the other cases.
            After 2008, prices in the high technology sensitivity begin to fall, as reduced energy

                  some households. Geothermal energy is used to power ground-source heat pumps, which
                  exchange energy with below-ground earth or water, extracting heat in the winter and
                  delivering heat to the earth (and cooling the building) in the summer. Solar thermal
                  energy is used mainly to heat water for swimming pools and household use. Photovoltaics
                  provide small-scale electricity generation, often in remote locations, using
                  semiconductors to transform sunlight directly into electricity, which may be used for a
                  variety of functions, such as water pumps or remote lighting systems. Fuel cells convert
                  liquid fossil fuels into electricity through electrochemical processes. </font></p>

                  as a primary heating fuel in the residential sector has been falling for nearly two
                  decades. In 1982, 6.7 percent of all U.S. households heated with wood, but its share fell
                  to 3.2 percent in 1993. The aggregate quantity of wood consumed as primary heating in
                  households has fallen as well, from 28.7 million cords in 1982 to 12.6 million cords in
                  1993.<sup>b</sup> The decline has resulted in part from local laws restricting wood
                  burning. In addition, the convenience of natural gas heating and the decline in real oil
                  and gas prices over the past decade have led many households to choose gas or oil over
                  wood. </font></p>

                  percent in 1993, suggesting that wood stoves are being kept as backup heating systems. If
                  the prices of other fuels rise significantly, however, the use of wood as a primary
                  household heating fuel may well increase. In the reference case for this analysis, wood
                  energy use is projected to be 0.61 quadrillion Btu in 2010. In the most stringent carbon
                  reduction case (7 percent below 1990 levels), higher energy prices lead to wood use of

            efficiency, even with ample financial benefits. Many market barriers tend to create what
            are known as high hurdle rates for consumer investments in energy efficiency. As of 1993,
            35 percent of all homes were occupied by renters,<a href="fnote1.html#31"><sup>31</sup></a> most of whom were responsible for paying energy bills but not for purchasing major
            energy-consuming appliances. Such households tend to buy the least expensive equipment on
            the market, which also tends to be the least energy-efficient. The same reasoning can be
            applied to many newly constructed homes as well, because the builders, not the occupants,
            are tasked with equipping them with most of the major energy-using appliances. Other
            barriers include equipment availability (e.g., whether plumbing contractors have
            high-efficiency water heaters available when they make service calls) and lack of
            information. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >To examine the effects that
            lower hurdle rates could have on both energy prices and expenditures in the carbon
            reduction cases, and at the same time differentiate those effects from the effects of
            technological advances, an increased consumer response sensitivity case was analyzed. This
            sensitivity case includes assumptions of lower discount rates, higher short-run
            elasticities of demand, greater inclination to change fuels when purchasing equipment, and
            lower growth in miscellaneous electricity use.<a href="fnote1.html#32"><sup>32</sup></a></font></p>

            assumptions regarding technological advancement and consumer behavior with respect to
            delivered energy consumption, sensitivity cases were analyzed relative to the 1990+9% case
            where delivered energy prices were the same across all cases. These cases serve to isolate
            the impact of each of the key variables separately, and to understand the impact of
            implementing the sensitivities simultaneously. This section evaluates the relative impact
            that each of these concepts could have on future energy intensity at a price level
            realized in the 1990+9% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Changes in technological
            development and the value residential consumers place on energy related issues can
            significantly affect the pattern of energy consumption&#151;and carbon emissions&#151;in
            the future. The availability of high-efficiency technologies in itself does not guarantee
            increased energy efficiency. Without the willingness of consumers to purchase the more
            efficient products, which usually cost significantly more, technology may not have much of
            an impact on future energy consumption patterns. Conversely, in a world where energy
            conservation was of paramount concern to energy consumers, yet at the same time
            high-efficiency products were unavailable, future energy consumption patterns would
            probably not be greatly affected either. </font></p>

            technologies, it is important to analyze the results at the technology level, as well as
            the overall level. With nearly 40 million households (38 percent) using electric water
            heaters in 1995, and given the relatively high intensity associated with using electric
            water heaters, the projected impact of increased energy efficiency can have a large impact
            on future electricity use for this service. Electric resistance water heaters have
            traditionally exhibited slow growth in energy efficiency. In fact, the highest efficiency
            unit available today is not likely to see any efficiency improvement due to thermal limits
            and diminishing returns on controlling heat loss<a href="fnote1.html#33">.<sup>33</sup></a> This implies that future gains in efficiency for electric water heating must be achieved
            through the increased penetration of electric air-source heat pump water heaters, which
            achieve higher efficiency levels by extracting heat from the air surrounding the unit. The
            current cost of this technology, however, is several times that of a traditional
            resistance unit, and coupled with observed implicit discount rates of over 100 percent,
            has led to very limited market penetration. </font></p>

            consumer behavior together, results in over a 25 percent decline in energy intensity for
            electric water heating over time. This indicates that a combination of both technology and
            consumer behavior changes can bring about large declines in energy intensity for this
            service, all else being equal. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Overall annual energy
            consumption per household, or energy intensity, for these sensitivity cases follows the
            general pattern described for electric water heating. Again, technology advances exhibit a
            greater potential for energy intensity decline in the long run (<a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure
              37</a>), but the combination of the two cases yields roughly half of the intensity decline
            projected for electric water heating. This is due to the fact that all other major
            technologies exhibit much lower observed hurdle rates and less range in terms of
            high-efficiency products. For example, natural gas furnaces, the largest energy consuming
            product class in terms of delivered energy in the U.S., has already matured in terms of
            product efficiency, and at the same time hurdle rates are at 15 percent. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font ><font size="2" face="Arial">The commercial sector
            consists of businesses and other organizations that provide services. Stores, restaurants,
            hospitals, and hotels are included, as well as a wide range of facilities that would not
            be considered &#147;commercial&#148; in a traditional economic sense, such as public
            schools, correctional institutions, and fraternal organizations. In the commercial sector,
            energy is consumed mainly in buildings, and relatively small amounts are used for
            services, including street lights and water supply. <br />

              </a><font size="2">T</font></font><font size="2" face="Arial">he commercial sector is
                currently the smallest of the four demand sectors in terms of energy use, accounting for
                11 percent of delivered energy demand in 1996. The commercial sector is also responsible
                for fewer carbon emissions than the other sectors, emitting 230 million metric tons, or 16
                percent of total U.S. carbon emissions, in 1996. The sector has a larger share of
                emissions than its share of energy use because of the importance of commercial electricity
                use. The emissions associated with electricity-related losses are included in the
                calculation of emissions from electricity use. </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Several factors determine
            energy use and, consequently, carbon emissions in the commercial sector. One of the most
            important is floorspace. Building location, age, and type of activity also affect
            commercial energy use. Currently, total commercial floorspace in the United States exceeds
            the area of the State of Delaware and amounts to about 200 square feet for every U.S.
            resident. Mercantile (retail and wholesale stores) and service businesses are the most
            common type of commercial buildings, and offices and warehouses are also common.<a href="fnote1.html#35"><sup>35</sup></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because of the relatively long
            lives of buildings, the characteristics of the stock of commercial floorspace change
            slowly. Over half of the commercial buildings in the United States were built before 1970,
            and the reference case used for this analysis projects that total commercial floorspace
            will grow at about the same rate as population, 0.8 percent annually, through 2020. This
            limits the effects that new, more efficient building practices can achieve in the near
            term, but as time passes and building stock &#147;turnover&#148; occurs, current and
            future building practices will have a greater effect on commercial energy use. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The composition of end-use
            services is another determinant of the amount of energy consumed and the type of fuel
            used. The majority of energy use in the commercial sector is for lighting, space heating,
            cooling, and water heating. In addition, the proliferation of new electrical devices,
            including telecommunications equipment, personal computers, and other office equipment, is
            spurring growth in electricity use. Electricity use currently accounts for 45 percent of
            delivered energy consumption in the sector, and that share is projected to grow to about
            48 percent by 2010 in the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Consideration of end-use
            services leads to another determining factor in commercial energy consumption&#151;the
            effects of turnover and change in end-use technologies. The stock of installed equipment
            changes with normal turnover as old, worn-out equipment is replaced and new buildings are
            outfitted with newer versions of&nbsp;equipment that tend to be more energy-efficient.
            Equipment with even greater energy efficiency is expected to be available to commercial
            consumers in the future. Energy prices have both short-term and long-term effects on
            commercial energy use. Fuel prices influence energy demand in the short run by affecting
            the use of installed equipment and in the long run by affecting the stock of installed
            equipment. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Legislated efficiency
            standards also affect energy use, by imposing a minimum level of efficiency for purchases
            of several types of equipment used in the commercial sector. Two mandates currently affect
            commercial appliances: the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486, Title II,
            Subtitle C, Section 342), which specifically targets larger-scale commercial equipment and
            fluorescent lighting, and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments (NAECA),
            which affect commercial buildings that install smaller residential-style equipment.
            Examples include standards for heat pumps, air conditioning units, boilers, furnaces,
            water heating equipment, and fluorescent lighting. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font  size="3" face="Arial"><b>Effects of Technology
            Availability and Choice</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The degree to which
            energy-efficient equipment can affect energy consumption, and in turn carbon emissions, in
            the commercial sector is limited by the level of efficiency available to commercial
            consumers and the rate at which more efficient equipment is purchased. Technologies for
            all the major end uses (lighting, heating, cooling, water heating, etc.) are defined by
            their installed cost, operating cost, efficiency, average useful life, and first and last
            dates of availability. These parameters are considered, along with fuel prices at the time
            of purchase, in the selection of technologies that provide end-use services. Commercial
            consumers are not assumed to anticipate any future changes in fuel prices when choosing
            equipment. The commercial sector encompasses a wide variety of buildings, and not all
            consumers will have the same requirements and priorities when purchasing equipment. Major
            assumptions that take these differences in behavior into account and affect commercial
            technology choices are described below. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In making the tradeoffs
            between equipment cost and equipment efficiency, the purchase behavior of the commercial
            sector is represented by distributing floorspace over a variety of hurdle rates. Rates of
            return on investments in energy efficiency (referred to in financial parlance as
            &#147;internal rates of return&#148;) are required to meet or exceed the hurdle rate.
            Floorspace is distributed over hurdle rates that range from a low of about 18 percent to
            rates high enough to cause choices to be made solely by minimizing the costs of installed
            equipment (i.e., future potential energy cost savings are ignored at the highest hurdle
            rate).<a href="fnote1.html#36"><sup>36</sup></a> The distribution of hurdle rates used in
            all the cases for this analysis is not static: as fuel prices increase, the nonfinancial
            portion of each hurdle rate in the distribution decreases.<a href="fnote1.html#37"><sup>37</sup> </a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >For a proportion of commercial
            consumers, it is assumed that newly purchased equipment will use the same fuel as the
            equipment it replaces. This proportion varies by building type and by type of
            purchase&#151;whether it is for new construction, to replace worn-out equipment, or to
            replace equipment that is economically obsolete. Purchases for new construction are
            assumed to show the greatest flexibility of fuel choice, while purchases for replacement
            equipment have the least flexibility. For example, when space heating equipment in large
            office buildings is replaced, 8 percent of the purchasers are assumed to consider all
            available equipment using any fuel or technology, while 92 percent select only from
            technologies that use the same fuel as the equipment being replaced. The proportions used
            are consistent with data from EIA&#146;s Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey
            and from published literature.<a href="fnote1.html#38"><sup>38</sup></a> Considerations
            such as owner versus developer financing, past experience, ease of installation, and fuel
            availability all play a role in fuel choice. This assumption also accounts for some of the
            factors that influence technology choices but cannot be measured. For example, a hospital
            adding a new wing has an economic incentive to use the same fuel that is used in the
            existing building. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The availability and costs of
            advanced technologies affect the degree to which they can contribute to future energy
            savings and carbon emission reductions. Many efficient technologies currently available to
            commercial consumers could significantly reduce energy consumption; however, their high
            purchase costs and the current low level of fuel prices have limited their penetration to
            date. As more advanced technologies mature over time, their costs are expected to decline
            (compact fluorescent lighting is an example). New technologies, beyond those available
            today, may also enter the market in the future. For example, the high technology
            sensitivity case, described below, assumes that by 2005 a triple-effect absorption
            natural-gas-fired commercial chiller will be widely available, and that
            &#147;typical&#148; heat pump water heaters will cost 18 percent less than assumed in the
            reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The combination of technology
            and behavior assumptions determines the commercial-sector price elasticity for each of the
            major fuels&#151;that is, how commercial-sector demand projections are affected by changes
            in energy prices. Specifically, the commercial-sector price elasticity for a particular
            fuel is the percent change in demand for that fuel in response to a 1-percent change in
            its delivered price. In the reference case, short-run price elasticities for fuel use in
            the commercial sector are -0.34 for electricity, -0.39 for natural gas, and -0.39 for
            distillate fuel oil. Long-term price elasticities in the reference case are higher,
            reflecting changes in both the use of existing equipment and the adoption rates for more
            efficient equipment: -0.36 for electricity, -0.44 for natural gas, and -0.45 for
            distillate fuel oil.<a href="fnote1.html#39"><sup>39</sup></a> The similarity of the
            short-run and long-run elasticities for electricity has two main causes. First, electric
            equipment becomes more efficient even with the reference case assumptions, thus reducing
            opportunities for further reductions when prices are higher. For example, electric
            lighting efficiency in the reference case increases on average by 0.6 percent per year
            from 1996 through 2020. Electric space cooling and ventilation improve on average by 1.1
            and 0.7 percent per year, respectively, over the same period. Second, miscellaneous
            electric end uses capture a growing share of commercial electricity consumption and
            exhibit the same response in the long run as in the short run. Building codes, equipment
            standards, and improvements in technology costs and performance contribute to reduced
            energy intensity in the commercial sector (i.e., annual energy consumption per square foot
            of floorspace) even in the absence of price changes. With constant real energy prices,
            energy intensity declines on average by 0.1 percent per year through 2010. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the 1990-3% case,
            commercial sector energy use in 2010 is projected to be below the 1996 level (<a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure 38</a>), and carbon emissions attributable to the
            commercial sector are projected to be 29 percent below their 1990 levels (<a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure 39</a>), despite 1-percent annual growth in commercial
            floorspace from 1996 to 2010. Projected fuel prices in 2010 in the 1990-3% case are more
            than twice as high as the reference case projection, and they are higher in real terms
            than they have been in any year since 1980 (<a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure 40</a>). As
            a result, energy consumption in 2010 is 22 percent lower in the 1990-3% case than in the
            reference case, and expenditures for energy purchases are 52 percent higher. Energy
            consumption starts to increase again later in the 1990-3% case, as demand reductions lead
            to a decline in fuel prices. Energy consumption in the 1990+24% and 1990+9% cases does not
            rebound as much, because prices do not fall at the rate seen in the 1990-3% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Floorspace expansion in the
            commercial sector will lead to growth in energy consumption if other factors remain the
            same. <a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure 41</a> removes the effects of floorspace growth by
            presenting commercial energy intensity in terms of delivered energy consumption per square
            foot of commercial floorspace. Although total energy consumption continued to increase
            
            when energy prices were rising from 1970 through 1982, commercial energy intensity
            declined by about 12 percent. Delivered energy intensity in the reference case is
            projected to remain essentially flat throughout the forecast. Projected commercial sector
            growth is offset by the availability and continued development of energy-efficient
            technologies, existing equipment efficiency standards, and voluntary programs such as
            those for the Climate Change Action Plan. In the carbon reduction cases, with higher
            energy prices, the energy intensities projected for 2010 are below the 1996 level. The
            projections for commercial delivered energy intensity in 2010 in the 1990+24%, 1990+9%,
            and 1990-3% cases are 5 percent, 13 percent, and 21 percent below the reference case
            projection, respectively. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >When energy prices rise,
            consumers are expected to reduce energy use by purchasing more efficient equipment and by
            altering the way they use energy-consuming equipment. In addition to buying more efficient
            boilers and chillers, commercial customers in the 1990-3% case are expected to choose more
            heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and efficient lighting technologies than they would
            in the reference case (<a href="tbl6.html">Table 6</a>). The same trends toward purchasing
            efficient technologies and monitoring energy use are projected in the 1990+9% case and in
            the 1990+24% case, but to a lesser degree than projected for the 1990-3% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The adoption of more efficient
            technologies reflects the reaction to rising fuel prices and a change in the way
            commercial consumers are expected to look at purchase decisions involving energy
            efficiency if carbon emissions are severely limited. Most commercial consumers give some
            consideration to fuel costs when buying equipment. A significant increase in fuel prices
            is expected to cause consumers to give energy costs greater weight in the purchase
            decision, by seeking out more information about energy efficiency options and by accepting
            a longer time period to recoup the additional initial investment typically required to
            obtain greater energy efficiency. While taking client comfort and employees&#146; working
            conditions into consideration, commercial energy consumers would also be expected to turn
            thermostats down (up) a few degrees during cooler (warmer) weather and to be more
            conscientious about turning off lights and office equipment not in use. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The vast majority of the
            projected commercial sector reductions in carbon emissions in the carbon reduction cases
            are related to electricity use (see <a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure 39)</a>. Two factors
            contribute to electricity-related carbon savings: reductions in the level of carbon
            emitted during the generation of a given amount of electricity (as discussed in Chapter
            4), and reductions in electricity consumption. The projections for delivered electricity
            consumption in the commercial sector in 2010 for the 1990-3% and 1990+9% cases are 19
            percent and 12 percent lower, respectively, than the reference case projection (<a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure 42</a>), and the 1990+24% case is 5 percent lower. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Historically, steady growth in
            electricity consumption has been seen in the commercial sector during times of both rising
            and falling prices. The growth has resulted in part from expansion in the sector and, more
            importantly, from an increasing number of end uses for electricity (i.e., increasing
            electricity intensity). The reference case projects further growth in electricity use
            between 1996 and 2010. In the 1990-3% case, however, the electricity consumption projected
            for 2010 falls to 1996 levels. The growth in commercial sector electricity intensity is
            projected to slow in the reference case for the same reasons that apply to energy
            intensity, and further reductions are expected in the carbon reduction cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The projected share of total
            end-use energy services that each major fuel provides to the commercial sector in 2010 is
            fairly stable across the different carbon reduction cases, and each fuel&#146;s share of
            energy consumption within specific end uses (space heating, cooling, water heating, etc.)
            shows little change. Electricity does increase slightly in share, however&#151;up to 2
            percentage points in 2010 in the 1990-3% and 7-percent-below-1990 (1990-7%) cases relative
            to the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because the carbon prices
            required to meet emissions reduction targets cause a greater percentage increase in
            natural gas prices than electricity prices relative to those in the reference case,
            commercial consumers are expected to curtail their use of equipment powered by natural gas
            more than their use of electrical equipment. In addition, because of its critical nature,
            the usage pattern of existing commercial refrigeration equipment is not assumed to change
            in response to price changes, limiting projected reductions in electricity use for
            refrigeration to those caused by potential earlier retirements and purchases of more
            efficient equipment when prices are higher. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Finally, the fastest-growing
            commercial end uses, under reference case assumptions, include office equipment and
            miscellaneous devices powered by electricity (e.g., telecommunications equipment, medical
            imaging equipment, ATM machines), which are continuing to penetrate the commercial sector.
            Although electricity consumption for these end uses would be responsive to the price
            signals resulting from emissions reduction efforts, their growth still is expected to be
            faster than growth in the end uses that consume fossil fuels (primarily space heating and
            water heating). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The expected effects of carbon
            emission reduction efforts on the average efficiencies of equipment stocks in the
            commercial sector are exemplified by the projections for natural-gas-fired space heating
            equipment. In the reference case, the average efficiency of natural gas space heating
            systems in the commercial sector is projected to increase by 0.6 percent per year through
            2010, and gas heating equipment purchased in 2005 is projected to be about 6.4 percent
            more efficient than the average system in use at that time. The 1990+24% case projects the
            same level of efficiency improvement and purchased efficiency. With 2010 natural gas
            prices expected to be near 1996 levels in this case (see <a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure
              40</a>), there is little incentive for purchasers to invest additional capital in more
            efficient gas heating systems. In the 1990+9% case, however, the projected higher gas
            prices yield a projected 0.7-percent annual increase in average stock efficiency and an
            average efficiency for new equipment purchases in 2005 that is 7.2 percent higher than the
            stock average. Similarly, in the 1990-3% case, the average stock efficiency for gas
            heaters in the commercial sector increases by 0.8 percent per year, and new gas heating
            systems are 7.5 percent more efficient, on average, than the stock average in 2005.
            Heating systems typically are purchased only for new construction, for major renovations,
            or when an existing system needs to be replaced. Once in place, they typically last over
            20 years. Therefore, the energy savings realized from purchases of more efficient
            equipment take time to accumulate. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Sensitivity case assumptions
            &nbsp;were developed for the 1990+9% case, to examine uncertainties about technology
            development in the commercial sector. Similar assumptions were developed for each of the
            demand sectors, and results were derived from integrated model runs requiring the entire
            U.S. energy system, not the commercial demand sector individually, to meet the specified
            emission reduction goals. Much different results might be expected if only commercial
            sector assumptions were modified and/or only the commercial sector was required to meet a
            specific emissions target, independent from other demand sectors and utilities. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The low technology sensitivity
            case assumes that all future equipment purchases will be made only from the equipment
            available to commercial consumers in 1998, and that commercial building shell efficiencies
            will remain at 1998 levels. Alternatively, the high technology sensitivity assumptions
            were developed by engineering technology experts, considering the potential impact on
            technology given increased research and development into more advanced technologies <a href="fnote1.html#40"><sup>40</sup></a>. The high technology sensitivity case includes
            technologies with higher efficiencies and/or lower costs than those assumed to be

            all sectors, may have on the fuel costs required for the United States to meet a specific
            emissions level. Different actions expected in the residential, commercial, industrial,
            transportation, and electricity generation sectors all contribute to meeting the emissions

                  considered in this report, neither photovoltaics nor fuel cells are projected to gain
                  significant market penetration, because of their high costs. With payback periods of more
                  than 20 years, the success of these technologies seems largely dependent on reducing
                  production costs and increasing efficiency (which would result in further cost reductions
                  for the consumer). Federal financial assistance would also play a role in their success. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Currently, electricity from

                  electricity from utility grids. Average prices in 1998 were 79 mills per kilowatt for
                  utility power, 112 mills for phosphoric acid fuel cells (with no cogeneration), and 461
                  mills for photovoltaic systems. To increase the market penetration rates of the
                  alternative technologies, their costs would have to be more competitive. </font></p>

                  chart below. The first pair of bars shows the projected payback periods in 2010 for the
                  1990-3% case with current technology performance and costs. The other projections
                  incorporate performance improvements of 50 percent for fuel cells and 70 percent for
                  photovoltaics, as well as the cumulative effects of various methods for reducing the
                  payback periods. The second set of bars shows the effects of the assumed performance
                  improvement. The third includes a 30-percent production cost reduction, the fourth
                  includes a 50-percent cost reduction, the fifth includes the incorporation of capital
                  costs into a mortgage plan, and the sixth includes a tax credit for photovoltaics and
                  depreciation adjustments for businesses. It is important to note that the substantial cost
                  reductions and improvements in efficiency (50 percent for fuel cells, 70 percent for
                  photovoltaics) are merely arbitrary assumptions and are not calculated projections for
                  future costs and efficiencies. These assumptions are not included in the carbon reduction

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Under the most favorable
                  assumptions shown in the graph, payback periods could be reduced to less than 1 year for
                  fuel cells and 2 years for photovoltaics. Although penetration levels are hard to predict
                  from payback periods, it can generally be assumed for the commercial and residential
                  sectors that paybacks within 3 to 4 years would be needed for significant penetration. In
                  the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, the Federal efficiency payback standard
                  for appliances is 3 years or less for investments to be non-burdensome to the consumer.
                  Although some utilities may have payback periods on their plants of 20 years, building
                  consumers are more likely to spend their money for efficient technologies elsewhere if
                  payback periods are over 4 years. To achieve 3- to 4-year paybacks, both the current
                  performance and the costs of these alternatives would have to be improved by the levels
                  shown here; however, the likelihood of such substantial improvements in the next two
                  decades is small. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Production costs for
                  photovoltaic modules have fallen from $100 per watt to $4 per watt over the past three
                  decades, an 11-percent annual decline, but since 1990 they have declined by an annual
                  average of only 3.9 percent.<sup>a</sup> To meet the cost reduction assumptions in these
                  scenarios, the production costs for photovoltaic cells and modules would have to decline
                  at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent through 2010. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The energy production
                  efficiency of photovoltaic modules has also improved, to approximately 12 percent today
                  from 9 percent in 1980.<sup>b</sup> Reaching the goal of 70 percent improvement in
                  performance, as assumed for this sensitivity analysis, would require an efficiency level
                  of 20 percent in 2010. Since 1980, the rate of improvement in performance for
                  photovoltaics has been less than 2 percent annually, whereas a 4.3-percent annual rate
                  would be needed to achieve a 70-percent improvement by 2010, and that improvement would
                  also have to be accompanied by cost improvements to achieve a 3- to 4-year payback period.
                  Fuel cells have been on the market for only a short time, and historical information is
                  not available. Neither technology appears to be on course to accomplish such a goal during
                  the period of this analysis, however, and thus extensive market penetration is not
                  probable for either photovoltaics or fuel cells. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Among the technology cases the
            highest carbon prices, and thus the highest fuel prices, in 2010 are projected in the
            1990+9% low technology sensitivity case. Due to the lack of technological progress in all
            sectors, higher fuel prices are required to achieve the demand reductions needed to reach
            the emissions target. The projected price of fuel to the commercial sector is 20 percent
            higher in the low technology case than in the 1990+9% case, resulting in 7 percent less
            commercial energy use. Commercial expenditures for fuel are also expected to be highest
            under these conditions (<a href="pdf/c3graph4.pdf">Figure 43)</a>. Fewer options for
            increased efficiency limit the potential for energy savings in the low technology case.
            The average efficiency of the equipment stock in this case continues to improve as normal
            turnover takes place and older equipment is replaced, but the most energy-efficient
            equipment available for purchase in 2010 or 2020 is what is available today (<a href="tbl8.html">Table 8</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the 1990+9% high technology
            sensitivity case, advanced technologies are expected to penetrate the market in all
            sectors over time as normal stock turnover results in the replacement of older, less
            efficient equipment. Projected technological advances throughout the energy market result
            in a carbon price in 2010 that is 25 percent lower than that projected in the 1990+9% case
            (see Table 7). In turn, the expected commercial fuel price in 2010 is 12 percent lower
            than in the 1990+9% case, resulting in 4 percent more energy consumption. Even though more
            advanced technologies are available in the high technology case, with less price
            incentive, commercial consumers are not as likely to purchase more costly equipment. For
            technologies such as commercial natural gas water heaters, where high technology
            assumptions specify lower costs in 2015 for the most efficient equipment, as compared with
            the reference case technology assumptions, more consumers are expected to adopt the
            efficient technology (see Table 8). The projected reduction in energy demand in other
            sectors causes commercial fuel prices to decline in the later years of the forecast,
          lowering commercial expenditures for fuel (Figure 43).</font></p></td>
