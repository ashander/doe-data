<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

            Higher or lower rates of productivity growth could occur in the carbon reduction cases

            In June 1998, a panel headed by then Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto urged the government
            to construct an additional 20 new nuclear plants over the next 12 years, with the goal of
            increasing Japan&#146;s nuclear generation by more than 50 percent between 1997 and 2010.
            EIA&#146;s <i>International Energy Outlook</i> (<i>IEO98</i>) high nuclear case projects
            an increase of 12.4 gigawatts (29 percent) in Japan&#146;s nuclear generating capacity
            over the same period. The <i>IEO98</i> reference case projects an increase of only 5.2
            gigawatts (12 percent) between 1996 and 2010.</p>

            This macroeconomic analysis of the costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol is limited to
            the consideration of investment costs that are comparable in magnitude to those in the
            reference case, as well as direct fuel costs. No consideration is given to the potential
            incremental costs of investment in technology and infrastructure that would be necessary
            in each of the specific cases analyzed. Business investments above reference case levels
            may be required to reduce energy costs in response to increasing energy prices.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="80" id="80"></a>[80] A
            permit auction system is identical to a carbon tax as long as the marginal abatement
            reduction cost is known with certainty by the Federal Government. If the target reduction
            is specified, as in this analysis, then there is one true price, which represents the
            marginal cost of abatement, and this also becomes the appropriate tax rate. In the face of
            uncertainty, however, the actual tax rate applied may over- or undershoot the carbon
            reduction target. Auctioning of the permits by the Federal Government is evaluated in this
            report. The costs of administering the program are not considered. To investigate a system
            of allocated permits would require an energy and macroeconomic modeling structure with a
            highly detailed sectoral breakout beyond those represented in the NEMS and DRI models. For
            a comparison of emissions taxes and marketable permit systems, see R. Perman, Y. Ma, and
            J. McGilvray, <i>Natural Resources and Environmental Economics</i> (New York, NY: Longman
            Publishing, 1996), pp. 231-233).</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="81" id="81"></a>[81]
            In the DRI model, the aggregate production function (the potential GDP equation) uses the
            following concepts as important variables: energy, labor, capital stocks of equipment and
            structures, and research and development expenditures. The aggregate supply is estimated
            by a Cobb-Douglas production function that combines factor input growth and improvements
            in total factor productivity. Factor input equals a weighted average of energy, labor,
            fixed capital (outside the energy-producing sector), and public infrastructure. Factor
            supplies for the non-energy sector are defined by estimates of the full-employment labor
            force, the full-employment capital net of pollution abatement equipment, domestic energy
            consumption, and the stock of infrastructure. Total factor productivity depends on the
            stock of research and development capital and a technological change trend.</p>

            The output measures presented in this chapter are expressed in constant 1992
            chain-weighted dollars. The DRI macroeconomic model uses National Income and Products
            Accounts (NIPA) as an estimating framework. Expressing these output measures in 1992
            dollars maintains consistency with the NIPA framework and facilitates comparison with
            results from other macroeconomic models. For the purposes of recycling the funds,
            collections and rebates are expressed in nominal dollars, to be consistent with the
            Federal Government&#146;s tax accounting system.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="83" id="83"></a>[83]
            The Federal funds rate is the rate charged by a depository institution on an overnight
            sale of Federal funds to another depository institution. This rate influences the trend in
            behavior for other interest rates in the economy.</p>

            In the DRI model for personal taxes only, a lump sum transfer produces the same effects as
            a cut in the personal income tax rate.</p>

            The PNNL study uses a dynamic-recursive, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with
            neoclassical elements. A model is a &#147;general equilibrium&#148; model if it represents
            all parts of the economy, both energy and non-energy, and all markets clear (supply equals
            demand at the prices determined). The model is &#147;computable&#148; if a computer is
            used to solve for the equilibrium; it is &#147;dynamic&#148; if it keeps track of
            variables over time. A model is &#147;neoclassical&#148; if the model structure assumes
            that (1) its economic agents have perfect foresight and knowledge of all past, present,
            and future events, (2) there is perfect and instantaneous ability of capital and labor to
            move between uses and sectors, and (3) such transitions are costless and instantaneous.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="93" id="93"></a>[93]
            The PNNL model (SGM) can be run with either perfect or imperfect foresight. Labor and new
            capital move freely.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="94" id="94"></a>[94] A
            carbon price of $221 per metric ton in 2010 would increase the delivered electricity price
            by 49 to 69 percent and reduce electricity consumption by 22 percent relative to PNNL's
            reference case. This implies that, on average, consumers will reduce consumption of
            electricity by 3.2 to 4.5 percent for every 10-percent increase in the price of
            electricity. In 2020, a carbon price of $286 per metric ton translates to an electricity
            price increase of 59 to 66 percent, resulting in a 28-percent reduction in electricity
            consumption. This implies that consumption will decline by about 4.2 to 4.7 percent for
            every 10-percent increase in price. (The estimated electricity price changes were derived
            from comparable EIA cases.)</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="95" id="95"></a>[95]
            For example, WEFA's annual electricity growth rate is 1.7 percent and EIA's is 0.9
            percent.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="96" id="96"></a>[96]
            The WEFA, CRA, MIT, and DRI models are econometric, general equilibrium, macroeconomic
            models. WEFA and DRI model the United States, CRA and MIT model the world.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="97" id="97"></a>[97]
            The full employment assumption means that the unemployment rate is unchanged from
            reference case levels.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="98" id="98"></a>[98]
            
            The CRA model uses perfect foresight for investment behavior, which may also contribute to
            underestimating the costs. It assumes that products (like gas and coal) are not perfect
            substitutes and capital is not perfectly malleable. Further, the demand for energy is only
            moderately responsive to price changes, compared to the PNNL model. CRA develops its model
            parameters using the GTAP database from Purdue University and the International Energy
            Agency (IEA) database.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="99" id="99"></a>[99]
            EPRI's MERGE model is an Aggregate Optimization Model and has perfect foresight. The EPRI
            model is being rebenchmarked to start in 2000 and should result in higher carbon prices
            and higher GDP losses in 2010 than are shown in their current analysis.</p>
          <p align="left"> <a name="100" id="100"></a>[100]
            For PNNL, since the model begins solving in 1985, policy instruments could be introduced
            as early as 1990. For this study, PNNL reports that the policy instruments for the Kyoto
            Protocol were phased in beginning in 2001.</p>

            The curve shown in Figure 114 in Chapter 6 of this report summarizes the relationship
            between the level of control and the marginal cost of that level of control. Hence, at
            each increment of control, the marginal cost is by definition equal to the economic
            resources that must be forgone in order to achieve the increment in control. It follows,
            therefore, that the sum of the marginal costs must equal the total cost of the controls
            that would be internalized in markets. This is the integral of the area under the curve,
            shown as area A in Figure 114. Conceptually, this is essentially the same effect that is
            measured by the unavoidable cost in the reduction of potential GDP in the macroeconomic
            models. As shown in Figure 115, this measure of the unavoidable costs using the results of
            the NEMS model is nearly identical to the similar estimate from the DRI macroeconomic
            model. </p>

            Furthermore, for the balance of total emissions needed to meet the Kyoto targets, permits
            would be purchased on the international market. If the marginal cost of control in the
            United States and the international prices of permits are in equilibrium, then the area B
            in Figure 114 will represent the total payments for permits, and the sum of the two parts
            will represent the irreducible losses to the economy under that trading regime to meet the
            Kyoto requirements.</p>

            Standard and Poors DRI recently analyzed three cases for the UMWA-BCOA LMPCP Fund. Case 1
            assumed that 8 percent of the necessary carbon reduction in 2010 would be accomplished
            from sinks and offsets, 15 percent from trading, and 77 percent domestically. Case 2
            
            assumed that sinks and offsets would account for 12 percent of the required reduction from
            baseline in 2010, 30 percent would be purchased from abroad, and 58 percent would be
            accomplished domestically. Case 3 assumes that sinks and offsets would generate 16 percent
            of the required reductions from baseline, 55 percent of the reduction would be purchased
            from abroad, and 29 percent of the reduction to be accomplished within domestic energy
            markets. Given that the DRI baseline for 1990 carbon emissions is 1,336 million metric
            tons, the domestic target for Case 1 in 2010 (1,354 million metric tons) is about 1
            percent above 1990 levels, Case 2 (1,452 million metric tons) is about 9 percent above
            1990 levels, and Case 3 (1,593 million metric tons) is about 19 percent above 1990 levels.</p>

            For simplicity and ease of exposition, it is assumed in this chapter that the carbon
            price, the price at the margin that the United States is willing to pay to reduce carbon
            emissions, equals the internationally traded permit price.</p>

            Other reference case differences that influence the Kyoto analysis include: (1) The DRI
            reference case projects 3.1 quadrillion Btu lower primary energy consumption and 1.8
            quadrillion Btu lower fossil fuel consumption in 2010 than does EIA. By 2020, the
            differences grow to 4.2 quadrillion Btu of primary energy and 2.4 quadrillion Btu of
            fossil fuel consumption. Associated carbon emissions are also lower. Consequently, it
            should be less costly for the economy to achieve the same carbon target (1,452 million
            metric tons) in the DRI analysis than in the EIA analysis (1,461 million metric tons in
            1990+9% case), as Table 31 confirms. (2) The DRI reference case projects higher world oil
            prices, higher delivered coal prices, and lower gas prices than the EIA reference case and
            greater coal, lower gas, and lower oil consumption than the EIA reference case for 2010
            and 2020. The differences in the mix of fuel consumption are related to the differences in
            fuel prices in the cases. Because the delivered price that consumers react to is the sum
            of the fuel costs plus the carbon price, when oil and coal prices are higher (without the
            carbon price), the additional carbon price required to achieve the same delivered coal and
            petroleum product prices will be lower. Higher reference case prices imply lower required
            carbon prices to induce an energy demand or mix change. Lower carbon prices usually result
            in lower economic losses.</p>

            According to Table 5, page 53, of the Administration's report, Annex I trading with
            participation by key developing countries would result in a permit price of $23 per metric
            ton and irreducible losses of $12 billion. Table 4 on page 52 of the report indicates that
            the permit price in that case would be reduced by 88 percent and the resource cost would
            be reduced by 80 percent relative to a &#147;domestic only&#148; case. This means that 12
            percent of the carbon price for the domestic only case would be $23, and thus the carbon
            price in the domestic only case would equal $192 per metric ton. Similarly, 20 percent of
            the domestic only resource cost would be $12 billion, meaning that the domestic only
            resource cost would be $60 billion. Using the percentages for Annex I trading in Table 4,
            the carbon price and the irreducible losses can also be derived for the Annex I trading
            case.</p>

            For the buildings sector (residential and commercial), a spreadsheet model was used for
            the Five-Lab Study, and it was calibrated to yield the results of the <i>Annual Energy
              Outlook 1997 (AEO97)</i> for a business-as-usual case. For the industrial sector, the
            Long-Term Industrial Energy Forecasting model was used, and it was calibrated to the <i>AEO97</i> results for the business-as-usual case. For the transportation sector, the transportation
            model of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) was used, and the <i>AEO97</i> baseline was modified based on the judgment of analysts at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
            to develop the business-as-usual case. For the electricity sector, a new model was
            developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which assumed a deregulated electricity
            industry.</p>
