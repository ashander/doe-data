<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>The Greenhouse Gas Effect</b> </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The greenhouse effect is a
            natural process by which some of the radiant heat from the Sun is captured in the lower
            atmosphere of the Earth, thus maintaining the temperature of the Earth's surface. The
            gases that help capture the heat, called &#147;greenhouse gases,&#148; include water
            vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and a variety of manufactured chemicals.
            Some are emitted from natural sources; others are anthropogenic, resulting from human
            activities. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Over the past several decades,
            rising concentrations of greenhouse gases have been detected in the Earth's atmosphere.
            Although there is not universal agreement within the scientific community on the impacts
            of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, it has been theorized that they may lead
            to an increase in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. To date, it has been
            difficult to note such an increase conclusively because of the differences in temperature
            around the Earth and throughout the year, and because of the difficulty of distinguishing
            permanent temperature changes from the normal fluctuations of the Earth's climate. In
            addition, there is not universal agreement among scientists and climatologists on the
            potential impacts of an increase in the average temperature of the Earth, although it has
            been hypothesized that it could lead to a variety of changes in the global climate, sea
            level, agricultural patterns, and ecosystems that could be, on net, detrimental. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The most recent report of the
            Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that: &#147;Our ability to
            quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited because the expected
            signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are
            uncertainties in key factors. These include the magnitudes and patterns of long-term
            variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing by, and response to, changes in
            concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and land surface changes. Nevertheless,
            the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernable human influence on global
            climate.&#148;<a href="fnote1.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In 1990, total greenhouse gas
            
            emissions in the United States were 1,618 million metric tons carbon equivalent,<a href="fnote1.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> according to 1997 estimates published by the Energy
            Information Administration (EIA).<a href="fnote1.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> Of this total,
            1,346 million metric tons, or 83 percent, was due to carbon emissions from the combustion
            of energy fuels&#151;the focus of this report. By 1996, total U.S. greenhouse gas
            emissions had risen to 1,753 million metric tons carbon equivalent, including 1,463
            million metric tons of carbon emissions from energy combustion. EIA's <i>Annual Energy
              Outlook 1998</i> (<i>AEO98</i>)<a href="fnote1.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a>projects that
            energy-related carbon emissions will reach 1,577 million metric tons in 2000, 17 percent
            above the 1990 level. Projected emissions continue to rise at an average annual rate of
            1.5 percent a year from 1996 to 2010, reaching 1,803 million metric tons of carbon
            emissions in 2010, 34 percent above the 1990 level. Because energy-related carbon
            emissions are a large portion of total greenhouse gas emissions, any efforts to reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions will likely have a significant impact on the energy sector;
            however, as discussed later, there are a number of factors outside the domestic energy
            market that also affect emissions levels. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >To put U.S. emissions in a
            global perspective, the United States produced about 24 percent of the worldwide
            energy-related carbon emissions in 1996, which totaled 6.6 billion metric tons, as noted
            in EIA's <i>International Energy Outlook 1998</i> (<i>IEO98</i>).<a href="fnote1.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> Although continued increases in carbon emissions are expected for the United States and

            projected for the developing countries of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central and
            South America. As a result, global carbon emissions from energy use are expected to
            increase at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent from 1996 through 2010, reaching 8.3
            billion metric tons, to which the United States would contribute about 22 percent. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>The Framework Convention on
            Climate Change</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >As a result of increasing
            warnings by members of the climatological and scientific community about the possible
            harmful effects of rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the IPCC was established by the
            World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme in 1988 to
            assess the available scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information in the field of
            climate change. A series of international conferences followed, and in 1990 the United
            Nations established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention
            on Climate Change. After a series of&nbsp;negotiating sessions, the text of the Framework
            Convention on&nbsp;Climate Change was adopted at the United Nations on May 9, 1992, and
            opened for signature at Rio de Janeiro on June 4. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The objective of the Framework
            Convention was to &#147;. . . achieve . . . stabilization of the greenhouse gas
            concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic
            interference with the climate system.&#148; The signatories agreed to &#147;formulate,
            implement, . . . and . . . update . . . programmes containing measures to mitigate climate
            change by addressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks&#148; and to
            prepare periodic emissions inventories, promote development and diffusion of technologies
            for emissions control, and cooperate in adaptation. In addition, the developed country
            signatories agreed to &#147;adopt national policies and take corresponding measures on the
            mitigation of climate change&#148; and to &#147;communicate . . . detailed information on
            its policies and measures . . . with the aim of returning individually or jointly to their
            1990 levels these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
            gases.&#148; The Convention excludes chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
            hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), greenhouse gases that are deemed to cause damage to the
            Earth's stratospheric ozone and are controlled by the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances
            that Deplete the Ozone Layer. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The Framework Convention
            established the Conference of the Parties to &#147;review the implementation of the
            Convention and . . . make, within its mandate, the decisions necessary to promote the
            effective implementation.&#148; In 1995, the first Conference of the Parties met in Berlin
            and issued the Berlin mandate, an agreement to &#147;begin a process to enable it to take
            appropriate action for the period beyond 2000.&#148; The second Conference of the Parties,
            held in Geneva in July 1996, called for negotiations on quantified limitations and
            reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and policies and measures for the third Conference
            of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Responding to the Framework
            Convention, on April 21, 1993, President Clinton called upon the United States to
            stabilize greenhouse gas emissions by 2000 at 1990 levels. Specific steps to achieve U.S.
            stabilization were enumerated in the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP),<a href="fnote1.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> published in October 1993, which consists of a
            series of 44 actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The actions include voluntary
            programs, industry partnerships, government incentives, research and development,
            regulatory programs including energy efficiency standards, and forestry actions.
            Greenhouse gases affected by these actions include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
            hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). At the time CCAP was developed,
            the Administration estimated that the actions it enumerated would reduce total net
            emissions<a href="fnote1.html#7"><sup>7</sup></a> of these greenhouse gases in the United
            States to 1990 levels by 2000. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In addition to the
            climate-related actions of CCAP, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), Section 1605(a),
            provided for an annual inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, which is contained in
            the EIA publication series, <i>Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States</i>.<a href="fnote1.html#8"><sup>8</sup></a> Also, Section 1605(b) of EPACT established the
            Voluntary Reporting Program, permitting corporations, government agencies, households, and
            voluntary organizations to report to EIA on actions that have reduced or avoided emissions
            of greenhouse gases. The results of the Voluntary Reporting Program are reported annually
            by EIA, most recently in <i>Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Voluntary Reporting</i>,<a href="fnote1.html#9"><sup>9</sup></a> which reports 1995 activities. Entities providing
            data to the Voluntary Reporting Program include some participants in government-sponsored

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Climate Wise and Climate
            Challenge programs, which are cosponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
            the U.S. Department of Energy to foster reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by industry
            and electricity generators. Voluntary activities for 1996 and 1997 will be available in
            the fall of 1998. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>The Kyoto Protocol</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Prior to the third Conference
            of the Parties, at the June 26, 1997, Earth Summit+5 Conference at the United Nations,
            President Clinton pledged U.S. support for binding emissions targets and announced three
            initiatives: a pledge of $1 billion over 5 years by the United States for the development
            of more energy-efficient and alternative energy technologies in developing countries; the
            strengthening of environmental guidelines for U.S. companies investing overseas; and a
            partnership with private industry to install solar panels on 1 million rooftops in the
            United States by 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >On October 22, 1997, President
            Clinton proposed that developed countries should stabilize emissions at 1990 levels
            between 2008 and 2012, with reductions below 1990 levels in the following 5-year period.
            He also indicated his support for joint implementation projects and international
            emissions trading and declared that participation by developing countries was necessary
            for the United States to assume binding obligations. At the same time, the President
            announced additional initiatives to address greenhouse gas emissions: a $5 billion program
            of tax incentives and research and development spending for energy-efficient and
            lower-carbon technologies; the establishment of an emissions trading system with credit
            for early reductions; the restructuring of the electricity industry; and reductions of
            emissions from Federal sources. Funding for the program was increased to $6.3 billion in
            the Administration's 1999 budget request. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Representatives from more than
            160 countries met in Kyoto on December 1 through 11, 1997. The resulting Kyoto Protocol
            established binding emissions targets for developed nations, relative to their emissions
            levels in 1990, for an overall reduction of about 5 percent.<a href="fnote1.html#10"><sup>10</sup></a> The&nbsp;individual targets for the Annex I countries<a href="fnote1.html#11"><sup>11</sup></a> range from an 8-percent reduction for the European Union (EU) (or its individual member
            states) to a 10-percent increase allowed for Iceland. Australia and Norway also are
            allowed increases of 8 and 1 percent, respectively, while New Zealand, the Russian
            Federation, and the Ukraine are held to their 1990 levels. Other Eastern European
            countries undergoing transition to market economies have reduction targets of between 5
            and 8 percent. The reduction targets for Canada and Japan are 6 percent and, for the
            United States, 7 percent. Although atmospheric <i>concentrations</i> of greenhouse gases
            ultimately have the potential to affect the global climate, the Protocol establishes
            targets in terms of <i>annual emissions</i>. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The greenhouse gases included
            in the targets are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons,
            perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.<a href="fnote1.html#12"><sup>12</sup></a> For
            the latter three gases, individual nations have the option of using 1995 as the base year
            from which to achieve reductions, instead of 1990. The aggregate target is established
            using the carbon dioxide equivalent of each of the greenhouse gases. Other greenhouse
            gases are not limited by the Protocol, although CFCs and HCFCs are controlled by the
            Montreal Protocol. This analysis focuses on carbon emissions from the combustion of energy
            fuels, which constituted 83 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. Carbon
            dioxide emissions from sources other than energy use are not included in the analysis, nor
            are emissions of the five other gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol; however, reductions
            in those gases may lessen the required reductions in energy-related carbon emissions, as
            discussed below. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The established targets must
            
            be achieved over the period 2008 to 2012, the first commitment period. Essentially, each
            country can average its emissions over that 5-year period to establish compliance,
            smoothing out short-term fluctuations that might result from economic cycles or extreme
            weather patterns. Each country must have made demonstrable progress by 2005. No targets
            are established for the period after 2012, although lower targets may be set by future
            Conferences of the Parties. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Sources of emissions include
            fuel combustion, fugitive emissions from fuels, industrial processes, solvents,
            agriculture, and waste management and disposal. The Protocol does not prescribe specific
            actions to be taken but lists a number of potential actions, including energy efficiency
            improvements, enhancement of carbon-absorbing sinks, such as forests and other vegetation,
            research and development of sequestration technologies, phasing out of fiscal incentives
            and subsidies that may inhibit the goal of emissions reductions, and reduction of methane
            emissions in waste management and in energy production, distribution, and transportation. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Several provisions of the
            Protocol allow for some flexibility in meeting the emissions targets. Net changes in
            emissions by direct anthropogenic land-use changes and forestry activities will also be
            used in meeting the commitment; however, these are limited to afforestation,
            reforestation, and deforestation since 1990. Emissions trading among the Annex I countries
            is permitted. No rules for trading are established, however, and the Conference of the
            Parties is required to establish principles, rules, and guidelines for trading at a future
            date. Joint implementation projects are also allowed among the Annex I countries, whereby
            a nation could take emissions credits for projects that reduce emissions or enhance sinks
            in other countries. It is specifically indicated that trading and joint implementation are
            supplemental to domestic actions. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The Protocol also establishes
            a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), under which Annex I countries can take emissions
            credits for projects that reduce emissions in non-Annex I countries, provided that the
            projects lead to measurable, long-term benefits. Reductions from such projects undertaken
            from 2000 until the first commitment period can be used to assist compliance in the
            commitment period. This provision calls for the establishment of an executive board to
            oversee the projects. In addition, an unspecified share of the proceeds from the project
            activities must be used to cover administrative expenses and to assist with adaptation
            those countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Banking&#151;the carrying over
            of unused allowances from one commitment period to the next&#151;is allowed; however, the
            borrowing of emissions allowances from a future commitment period is not permitted. Under
            the Protocol, Annex I countries, such as the nations of the&nbsp;European Union (EU), may
            create a bubble or umbrella to meet the total commitment of all the member nations. In a
            bubble, countries agree to meet the total commitment jointly by allocating a share to each
            member. In an umbrella arrangement, the total reduction of all member nations is met
            collectively through the trading of emissions rights. There is potential interest in the
            United States in entering into an umbrella trading arrangement. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Non-Annex I countries have no
            targets under the Protocol, although it reaffirms the commitments of the Framework
            Convention by all parties to formulate and implement climate change mitigation and
            adaptation programs and to promote the development and diffusion of environmentally sound
            technologies and processes. Developing countries can voluntarily enter into the Protocol
            by full amendment of the Protocol. </font></p>

            accounting for at least 55 percent of the total 1990 carbon dioxide emissions from Annex I

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >There are a number of
            uncertainties and issues to be resolved at future Conferences of the Parties. As indicated
            in the Protocol, rules and guidelines for the accounting of emissions and sinks from
            activities related to agriculture, land use, and forestry activities must be developed.
            The specific guidelines may have a significant impact on the level of reductions from
            other sources that a country must undertake. This issue was directed to the IPCC by
            subsequent climate change talks in Bonn in June 1998. In addition, rules and guidelines
            must be established for emissions trading, joint implementation projects, and the CDM. </font></p>

            change adaptation actions, sanctions for failure to meet commitments, guidelines for the
            reporting and review of emissions and sinks, and international cooperation in education,
            research and development, and technology transfer. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Emissions Trading</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Even before the Kyoto
            Protocol, many analyses of the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions reductions have favored
            emissions trading programs, including joint implementation programs, as a means of
            achieving emissions reductions. In the United States, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
            (CAAA90) established a trading program for emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) by
            electricity generators in order to reduce emissions to fixed specified levels. Permits
            issued to electricity generators allow them to emit up to a specified level of SO<sub>2</sub>,
            with the total number of issued permits equal to the national limit on emissions.
            Generators may reduce emissions by using lower-sulfur coals, installing scrubbers, or
            increasing the utilization of cleaner-generating plants. Generators that reduce emissions
            below their allowed levels can sell excess emissions permits, which can be purchased by
            other generators for whom it is more cost-effective to purchase permits at the prevailing
            market price than to reduce emissions. Emissions permits can also be banked for future
            use. Compared with traditional control programs that mandate specific compliance options
            or require uniform reductions, this SO<sub>2</sub> trading program is credited with
            reducing the overall cost of compliance by allowing reductions to be made in the most
            cost-effective manner. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Unlike SO<sub>2</sub>, carbon
            emissions are primarily an international, rather than domestic, issue. In theory, a
            similar trading scheme for carbon emissions could be formulated either internationally or
            within individual countries to achieve fixed emissions levels. Indeed, the Kyoto Protocol
            provides for international emissions trading but defers the determination of specific
            guidelines and rules for establishing an open trading market and managing the
            international flow of funds for the purchase of permits. Additional complexities may arise
            in establishing baseline projections against which to monitor and verify net emissions
            reductions, particularly with regard to the CDM. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Even within the United States,
            carbon emissions trading may be more complicated than the current SO<sub>2</sub> trading
            plan for several reasons. The largest sources of SO<sub>2</sub> are a small number of
            large coal-burning generation plants. This makes it relatively easy to monitor their fuel
            use and emissions and to build and maintain an allowance trading system to ensure
            compliance. In contrast, there are a large number of entities that emit carbon, including
            households, commercial establishments, industrial facilities, automobiles, trucks,
            airplanes, ships, and fossil-fired generating stations. The development and operation of a
            monitoring and trading system for carbon emissions would thus be much more complicated. In
            addition, there were technologies available to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions at
            generation plants at the time the allowance trading program was initiated, and switching
            to low-sulfur coal was an option. Although research is ongoing, there are no readily
            available pre- or post-combustion technologies for removing carbon from fossil fuels
            (although the high technology sensitivity case included in this analysis assumes that
            carbon sequestration technologies will become available for electricity generators).
            Therefore, the options for carbon reduction are limited to fuel switching to lower-carbon
            or carbon-free fuels, efficiency improvements, and reductions in energy demand. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="4" ><b>Methodology of the
            Analysis</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In March 1998, the U.S. House
            of Representatives Committee on Science requested that the EIA perform an analysis of the
            Kyoto Protocol, focusing on the impacts of the Protocol on U.S. energy prices, energy use,
            and the economy in the 2008 to 2012 time frame for a number of emissions targets. (See
            letters of request in Appendix D.) The request specified that the analysis use the same
            reference case assumptions as in <i>AEO98</i> unless changes in the assumptions could be
            justified on the basis of the Protocol&#151;that is, there should be no changes in
            assumptions regarding policy, regulatory actions, or funding of&nbsp;energy or
            environmental programs, including the energy-related provisions of the Administration's
            revenue proposals of February 1998. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Each target in the analysis
            was to be achieved on average between 2008 and 2012, phasing in beginning in 2005 and
            stabilizing at the target level after 2012, although targets beyond 2012 have not yet been
            established and may in fact be more stringent. The Committee indicated that no new nuclear
            plants should be allowed, although economical life extensions of nuclear plants should be
            permitted. Construction of new nuclear plants, variations in economic growth, and
            different assumptions concerning technology characteristics were all to be analyzed as
            sensitivities to the target cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Numerous studies have been
            conducted on the topic of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They can be clustered into
            several broad categories. One group of studies are cost-benefit analyses, which seek to
            establish an optimal level of either emissions reductions or emissions prices with a goal
            of balancing the costs and benefits of emissions reductions, explicitly accounting for the
            mitigation of damage as a result of emissions controls. A second category of studies
            address the cost-effectiveness of alternative paths for emissions reductions. Assuming a
            level of global concentrations of greenhouse gases, these analyses derive an optimal
            timing strategy for the imposition of emissions controls. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Other studies are more
            narrowly focused on the costs of achieving specific emissions reductions or on the impacts
            of policies and technology on emissions levels. Before the Conference of the Parties in
            Kyoto, analyses examined the costs of emissions targets under a variety of assumptions
            about the possible level and timing of the targets. Since the Conference, analyses have
            focused on the levels and timing specified in the Kyoto Protocol and studied the costs of
            achieving those levels under a range of assumptions about the international provisions and
            other flexibility measures in the Protocol. Some of those analyses are included in the
            comparison of results in Chapter 7. This EIA analysis is among this final category of
            studies, with more detail on U.S. energy markets and the economy than other analyses but
            not addressing the potential benefits of emissions reductions, optimal timing, or
            international trade. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The Protocol includes a number
            of international provisions&#151;including international emissions trading, joint
            implementation projects, and the CDM&#151;that may reduce the cost of compliance. Because
            EIA cannot fully address these aspects of the Protocol at this time, the analysis focuses
            on domestic impacts and includes a range of cases with different levels of energy-related
            carbon emissions. Although any impact on the global climate will likely be caused by
            atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, the targets in the Kyoto Protocol are in
            terms of annual emissions. This analysis addresses the annual emissions targets as
            specified in the Protocol. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >At the request of the
            Committee, this analysis uses the same basic assumptions and methodologies that were used
            for <i>AEO98</i>. The projections in <i>AEO98</i> were developed using the National Energy
            Modeling System (NEMS), an energy-economy modeling system of U.S. energy markets, which is
            designed, implemented, and maintained by EIA.<a href="fnote1.html#13"><sup>13</sup></a> The production, imports, conversion, consumption, and prices of energy are projected for
            each year through 2020, subject to assumptions on macroeconomic and financial factors,
            world energy markets, resource availability and costs, behavioral and technological choice
            criteria, costs and performance characteristics of energy technologies, and demographics.
            NEMS is a fully integrated framework, capturing the interactions of energy supply, demand,
            and prices across all fuels and all sectors of U.S. energy markets. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Reference case projections are
            developed annually using NEMS and published in the <i>Annual Energy Outlook</i> (<i>AEO</i>).
            NEMS is also used to analyze the effects of existing and proposed laws, regulations, and
            standards related to energy production and use; the impacts of new and advanced energy
            technologies; the savings from higher energy efficiency; the impacts of energy tax policy
            on the U.S. economy and energy system; and the impacts of environmental policies, such as
            the CAAA90 and regulations on alternative and reformulated fuels. Special analyses of
            these and other topics are performed at the request of the U.S. Congress, other offices in
            the U.S. Department of Energy, and other government agencies. Because NEMS provides annual
            projections, it is well suited to represent the transitional effects of proposed energy
            policy and regulation. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Within NEMS, four end-use
            demand modules represent energy consumption in the residential, commercial, industrial,
            and transportation sectors, subject to fuel prices, macroeconomic factors, and the
            characteristics of energy-using technologies in those sectors. The fuel supply and
            conversion modules represent the domestic production, imports, transportation, and
            conversion processes to meet the domestic and export demand for coal, petroleum products,
            natural gas, and electricity, accounting for resource base characteristics, industry
            infrastructure and technology, and world market conditions. The modules of NEMS interact
            to solve for the economic supply and demand balance for each fuel. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In order to capture regional
            differences in energy consumption patterns and resource availability, NEMS is a regional
            model. The end-use demand for energy is represented for each of the nine Census divisions.
            The supply and conversion modules use the North American Electric Reliability Council
            regions and subregions for electricity generation; aggregations of the Petroleum
            Administration for Defense Districts for refineries; and production regions specific to
            oil, natural gas, and coal supply and distribution. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >NEMS incorporates interactions
            between the energy system and the economy and between domestic and world oil markets. Key
            macroeconomic variables, including the gross domestic product (GDP), disposable personal
            income, industrial output, housing starts, employment, and interest rates, drive energy
            consumption and investment decisions. In turn, changes in energy prices and energy
            activity affect economic activity, a feedback captured within NEMS. Also, an international
            energy module in NEMS represents world oil prices, production, and demand and the
            interactions between the domestic and world oil markets. Within this module, world oil
            prices and supplies respond to changes in U.S. demand and production. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Technology Representation
            in NEMS</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >A key feature of NEMS is the
            representation of technology and technology improvement over time. The residential,
            commercial, transportation, electricity generation, and refining sectors of NEMS include
            explicit treatments of individual technologies and their characteristics, such as initial
            cost, operating cost, date of commercial availability, efficiency, and other
            characteristics specific to the sector. In addition, for new generating technologies, the
            electricity sector accounts for technological optimism in the capital costs of
            
            first-of-a-kind plants and for a decline in the costs as experience with the technologies
            is gained both domestically and internationally. In each of these sectors, equipment
            choices are made for individual technologies as new equipment is needed to meet growing
            demand for energy services or to replace retired equipment. In addition, in the
            electricity generation sector, fossil-fired and nuclear generating units can be retired
            before the end of their useful lives if it is more economical to bring on a replacement
            unit than to continue to operate the existing unit. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the other
            sectors&#151;industrial, oil and gas supply, and coal supply&#151;the treatment of
            technologies is somewhat more limited due to limitations on the availability of data for
            individual technologies. In the industrial sector, technology improvement for the major
            processing steps of the energy-intensive industries is represented by technology
            possibility curves of efficiency improvements over time. In the oil and gas supply sector,
            technology progress for exploration and production activities is represented by
            trend-based improvement in finding rates, success rates, costs, and the size of the
            resource base. Productivity improvements over time represent technological progress in
            coal production. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because of the detailed
            representation of capital stock vintaging and technology characteristics, NEMS captures
            the most significant factors that influence the turnover of energy-using and producing
            equipment and the choice of new technologies. New, more advanced technologies for
            buildings and equipment are generally characterized by the technology costs, performance,
            and availability, existing standards, and energy prices. Equipment that does not meet
            efficiency standards is not available as a choice. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The relative costs of
            purchasing and operating different types of equipment are factored into consumer choices,
            which are represented by elasticities and discount rates derived from the analysis of
            available data. Within the residential sector, for example, housing stocks are calculated
            by region and housing type, using aggregate housing starts from the macroeconomic forecast
            and assumed retirement rates. Stocks of energy-using equipment are also tracked,
            reflecting equipment retirement, replacements, and new housing starts. Choices for new
            equipment and efficiency levels for new houses are influenced by the characteristics of
            available technology, existing standards, energy prices, and consumer preferences as
            reflected in past decisions. In the end-use sectors, all technology choices are based on
            the assumption that future energy prices will remain at the same level as the prices for
            the year in which the decision is being made, this being the most likely representation of
            how customer decisions are made. However, in the generation and refining sectors, which
            are cost minimizers, capacity expansion decisions include foresight of future energy
            prices and demand. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In all sectors, technology
            improvement occurs even in a reference case because new, more efficient technology will be
            
            adopted as demand for energy services increases and existing buildings and equipment are
            retired. The characteristics of the technologies include initial dates of commercial
            availability of more advanced technologies as well as changes in efficiency and cost that
            are assumed to occur in the future. Higher energy prices may accelerate the adoption of
            more efficient technologies. Past improvements in energy efficiency have resulted in part
            from efficiency standards that are included in the analysis; future efficiency standards
            assumed are those approved standards with specified efficiency levels. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The detailed characterization
            of energy consumption patterns and technology decisions in NEMS allows for an explicit
            representation of the introduction of new energy-using equipment and the improvement of
            the capital stock. Because longer-term forecasting models typically are not annual models,
            they tend not to capture the gradual transition of energy markets, including the capital
            stock vintaging and turnover, as NEMS does. In addition, because of the longer time
            horizon, longer-term models tend to have less detailed representations of energy markets. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Although prices play a role in
            consumers' decisions on energy-consuming equipment, there are other factors that come into
            play. Consumers tend to make decisions based on a number of personal preferences and
            lifestyle choices, in which energy prices may be only a part of the decisionmaking
            process. Preferences for larger televisions or higher horsepower vehicles are examples of
            factors that may outweigh energy costs. As another example, in the residential sector,
            home rental instead of purchase and frequent moving tend to lower the incentive to invest
            in more energy-efficient equipment. Information also has a major role in consumer
            decisions and will likely continue to do so in the adoption of new, more advanced
            technologies. Particularly when a more efficient or alternatively fueled technology
            carries a significantly higher cost or has different operational characteristics than more
            conventional technologies, information on the benefits of the new technology will be key
            to its adoption and penetration. Ultimately, the success of a given technology will depend
            not on the behavior of the marginal consumer, who may be particularly cost-conscious or
            innovative, but on the behavior of the average consumer, whose decision rests on a number
            of considerations. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Technology improvements, even
            when adopted in the market, may not necessarily lead to reductions in energy demand. In
            the transportation sector, for example, the use of more advanced technologies that could
            improve vehicle efficiency has been offset by increasing demand for larger and higher
            horsepower vehicles. To the extent that energy prices are a factor in consumer decisions,
            efficiency improvements may also increase energy demand. Efficiency gains may lower the
            cost of driving or operating other equipment, perhaps encouraging more travel, larger
            homes, and purchases of more equipment and increasing the demand for energy services. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >New or tightened efficiency
            standards could also reduce the demand for energy, but stock turnover would still limit
            the speed of penetration. Standards have also been suggested to encourage the use of
            renewable fuels for electricity generation, such as those in the proposed Electric System
            Public Benefits Protection Act of 1997, the proposed Electric Consumers Protection Act of
            1997, and the Administration's proposed Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act;
            however, proposed and possible future standards, legislation, and programs are not
            included in the analysis. </font></p>

            year. Domestically, with technological advances in the exploration and production of
            natural gas, the average annual growth in the average wellhead price is projected to be
            0.5 percent even with rapid growth in the demand for natural gas. The average price of
            coal declines throughout the projection period due to increasing productivity in coal
            production and the expansion of production from lower-cost western sources. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" ><i>AEO98</i> represents the
            ongoing restructuring of the electricity industry by assuming lower operating,
            maintenance, and administrative costs, as noted in the trends of recent data; early
            retirements of higher-cost coal-fired and nuclear power plants; and lower capital costs
            and efficiency improvements for coal- and natural-gas-fired generation technologies.
            Additional assumptions include a revised financial structure that features a higher cost
            of capital in competitive markets. Specific restructuring plans are included for those
            regions that have announced plans. California, New York, and New England are assumed to
            begin competitive pricing in 1998 with stranded cost recovery phased out by 2008. The
            provisions of the California legislation for stranded cost recovery and price caps are
            incorporated. With these assumptions and declining coal prices, electricity prices decline
            at an average annual rate of 1 percent in the <i>AEO98</i> projections. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Electricity generation from
            nuclear power declines significantly in the projections. About 20 percent of the nuclear
            capacity available in 1996 is assumed to be retired by 2010, with no new plants
            constructed. It is assumed that nuclear units would be retired as early as 10 years before
            the expiration of their operating licenses, based on utility announcements and on analysis
            of the age and operating costs of the units. To offset the decline of nuclear power and to
            meet the growth of electricity demand, coal and natural gas generation expand in the
            projections, particularly the gas technologies. The financial assumptions for
            restructuring weigh against more capital-intensive projects, such as coal and baseload
            renewable technologies. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >With decreases or moderate
            increases in the prices of energy and continued economic growth, total energy consumption
            in <i>AEO98</i> increases by 1 percent a year on average through 2020. Consumption in all
            end-use sectors grows in the projections; however, demand in the transportation sector
            increases most rapidly, reflecting increased travel and slow improvement in the efficiency
            of vehicles. Total energy intensity, measured as energy use per dollar of GDP, declines in
            the projections at an average annual rate of 0.9 percent. This rate is considerably less
            than the 2.3-percent decline in energy intensity experienced between 1970 and 1986 when
            rapid price increases and a shift to less energy-intensive industries led to rapid energy
            intensity improvements. On average, energy intensity has been flat between 1986 and 1996.
            The projected improvement still reflects continued improvements in energy efficiency that
            partially offset increases in the demand for energy services. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >As noted earlier, projected
            carbon emissions from energy combustion in <i>AEO98</i> reach 1,803 million metric tons in
            2010, 34 percent above the 1990 level of 1,346 million metric tons, rising to 1,956
            million metric tons in 2020. Total emissions are projected to increase at an average
            annual rate of 1.5 percent between 1996 and 2010 in the reference case, and per capita
            emissions also increase at an average annual rate of 0.7 percent during that period, as
            continued economic growth and moderate price increases encourage growth in energy services
            and energy consumption. Between 2010 and 2020, efficiency improvements tend to offset
            
            continued growth in the demand for energy services, and per capita emissions nearly
            flatten. During that period, total emissions increase at an average rate of 0.8 percent a
            year. Over the entire projection period, the slow growth of renewable technologies and the
            decline of electricity generation from nuclear power plants also contribute to the growth
            of emissions. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Projections of carbon
            emissions in <i>AEO98</i> include EIA's analysis of the impacts of CCAP for the 31 of the
            44 CCAP actions that relate to carbon dioxide emissions from energy combustion. The
            analysis does not account for the remaining actions related to non-energy programs, gases
            other than carbon dioxide, or forestry and land use. The analysis of CCAP represents EIA's
            estimate of the effects of incorporating assumptions concerning behavioral change as a
            result of CCAP and does not result in the reductions estimated by the developers of CCAP.
            The initial estimates of the impacts of the CCAP actions by the Administration projected
            stabilization of net greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 at 1990 levels; however, a more
            recent review and update of CCAP significantly reduces the expected impact.<a href="fnote1.html#14"><sup>14</sup></a> In <i>AEO98</i>, carbon emissions in 2010 are
            reduced by about 36 million metric tons as a result of CCAP, compared with the more recent
            estimate by the sponsors of about 95 million metric tons for the energy-related actions in
            CCAP. Differences between the CCAP impacts estimated by EIA and by the program sponsors
            are due primarily to differences in the estimated impacts of voluntary programs; some
            estimates by the sponsors that include ongoing trends that would occur even in the absence
            of CCAP; and regulatory actions included by the sponsors but not included by EIA because
            they are not yet enacted or finalized. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The <i>Annual Energy Outlook
            1995</i> (<i>AEO95</i><a href="fnote1.html#15">)<sup>15</sup></a> was the first <i>AEO</i> to include the impacts of CCAP in the projections. Even then, the goal of stabilizing
            carbon emissions in 2000 at 1990 levels seemed unlikely. <i>AEO95</i> projected that
            energy-related carbon emissions would reach 1,471 million metric tons in 2000, a level
            nearly reached in 1996 when emissions were 1,463 million metric tons. Each subsequent <i>AEO</i> has raised the estimate of carbon emissions, primarily because of lower price projections
            that encourage energy use and reduce the penetration of renewable sources of energy. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >There are several reasons that
            the target specified by CCAP for 2000 is unlikely to be realized. First, U.S. economic
            growth has been slightly higher than assumed at the time the CCAP programs were
            formulated. Second, energy prices have increased at a more moderate rate than initially
            assumed in the early 1990s. Both these factors have contributed to higher growth in energy
            consumption than earlier assumed, leading to higher emissions levels. Third, the funding
            for a number of the CCAP programs is lower than initially requested. Finally, some
            voluntary programs have proven less effective than initially estimated by the
            Administration. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial" ><b>Carbon Reduction Cases</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The Kyoto Protocol specifies
            that the U.S. target for total greenhouse gas emissions in the first commitment period
            will be 7 percent below the level of emissions in 1990. This analysis focuses on the
            carbon dioxide emissions from the use of energy, which constituted 83 percent of total
            U.S. greenhouse emissions in 1996 (1,463 million metric tons of energy-related carbon
            emissions in the total greenhouse gas emissions of 1,753 million metric tons carbon
            equivalent). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The specific reduction in
            energy-related carbon emissions that will be required is highly dependent on a number of
            factors outside the domestic energy sector. Programs to reduce emissions of the other five
            greenhouse gases covered by the Protocol may decrease the requirement for reductions in
            carbon dioxide emissions. Similarly, forestry, agriculture, and land use programs may also
            offset some carbon dioxide emissions; however, the rules to account for agriculture and
            forestry emissions and sinks have yet to be developed and are subject to considerable
            uncertainty. According to a fact sheet prepared by the U.S. Department of State on January
            15, 1998, discussing the Kyoto negotiations, the method of accounting for sinks and the
            flexibility to use 1995 as the base year for the synthetic greenhouse gasses may mean that
            the reduction would be no more than 3 percent below 1990 levels, based on the
            Administration's estimates<a href="fnote1.html#16">.<sup>16</sup></a> Similar estimates
            were cited by Dr. Janet Yellen, Chair, Council of Economic Advisers, in her testimony
            before the House Committee on Commerce, Energy and Power Subcommittee, on March 4, 1998.<a href="fnote1.html#17"><sup>17</sup></a> Finally, because this analysis does not fully
            represent international energy markets and other activities, the potential role of
            international emissions trading and the CDM in alleviating U.S. reductions of carbon
            dioxide is not directly represented in the analysis. Even those analyses that do include
            international trade must make assumptions about the activities, because the development of
            guidelines and mechanisms has been deferred. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The success of programs to
            reduce greenhouse gases at relatively low costs may depend on the success of international
            trade of carbon permits, joint implementation projects, and the CDM. Some analyses of
            greenhouse gas reductions that have low costs of compliance assume that a number of
            relatively low-cost carbon permits will be available from Annex I countries with less
            expensive opportunities to reduce emissions. Based on EIA's analysis in <i>IEO98</i>,
            there may be 165 million metric tons of carbon permits available from the Annex I
            countries in the former Soviet Union in 2010, because of the economic decline of those
            countries in the 1990s, and additional permits may be available as a result of carbon
            reduction projects. The total estimate of such opportunities is highly uncertain, however,
            and it is also unclear whether those countries would choose to sell available permits
            immediately or bank them for later use as their economies and populations grow. The
            potential transaction costs of international trading are also unknown. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The role of developing
            countries is another area of uncertainty for international activities. In July 1997, the
            Senate unanimously passed the Byrd-Hagel resolution, sponsored by Senators Robert Byrd of
            West Virginia and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, resolving &#147;that the United States should
            not be a signatory to any protocol to, or other agreement regarding, the United Nations
            Framework Convention on Climate Change . . . which would mandate new commitments to limit
            or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or other
            agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments . . . for Developing Country
            Parties within the same compliance period or would result in serious harm to the economy

            has declared on several occasions that he will not submit the Protocol for ratification

            by developing countries may be key to the acceptance of the Protocol, development of
            specific guidelines and rules for the international programs has been deferred, including
            the means to establish baseline projections and to monitor and verify emissions
            reductions. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >There is also a possibility
            that investments to reduce carbon emissions in developing countries could be limited.
            First, such bilateral ventures may be viewed as substitutes for or additions to foreign
            aid, a political concern to both the United States and developing countries. Also, it is
            possible that the continuing discussions about the implementation of the Protocol will
            raise the topic of trade limits&#151;restrictions on the amount of reductions that any one
            country can satisfy through international programs. The Protocol states that such
            activities are to be supplemental to domestic actions. In the views of some countries,
            there is a potential problem with certain nations undertaking little internal action. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because the potential impacts

            required reductions in energy-related carbon emissions in the United States cannot be
            developed at present. This analysis includes a number of cases, as requested by the
            Committee, assuming different levels of reductions in energy-related carbon emissions, in
            order to develop the energy and economic impacts of achieving those reductions. By
            establishing this range of carbon reductions, the analysis allows others to perform their
            own analyses of the impacts of sinks, offsets, and international programs, derive their
            own targets for energy-related carbon emissions, and use one of the EIA target cases to
            assess the energy and economic impacts of the carbon reductions in that case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In addition to a reference
            case, six targets for reductions in energy-related carbon emissions are considered. </font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>Reference Case (33 Percent Above 1990
              Levels).</b> This case represents the reference projections of energy markets and carbon
              emissions without any enforced reductions and is presented as a comparison for the energy
              market impacts in the reduction cases. Although this reference case is based on the
              reference case from <i>AEO98</i>, as specified by the Committee, there are small
              differences between this case and <i>AEO98</i>. Some modifications were made in order to
              permit additional flexibility in NEMS in response to higher energy prices or to include
              certain analyses previously done offline directly within the modeling framework, such as
              nuclear plant life extension and generating plant retirements. Also, some assumptions were
              modified to reflect more recent assessments of technological improvements and costs.
              Significant changes to NEMS and its assumptions relative to <i>AEO98</i> are noted in
              
              Appendix A. As a result of these modifications, the projections of carbon emissions in the
              reference case for this analysis are slightly lower than those in the <i>AEO98</i> reference case&#151;1,791 million metric tons in 2010 compared with 1,803 million metric
              tons. The carbon emissions projections in the reference case, as well as in all the carbon
              reduction cases, include EIA's estimate of the impacts of CCAP. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>24 Percent Above 1990 Levels (1990+24%).</b> This case assumes that carbon emissions can increase to an average of 1,670 million metric
              tons in the commitment period 2008 to 2012, 24 percent above the 1990 levels, but 122
              million metric tons below the average emissions in the reference case during that period.<br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>14 Percent Above 1990 Levels (1990+14%).</b> This case assumes that carbon emissions in the commitment period average 1,539 million
              metric tons, which is approximately the level estimated for 1998 in <i>AEO98</i> and is 14
              percent above 1990 levels. This requires the average annual carbon emissions between 2008
              and 2012 to be reduced by 253 million metric tons. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>9 Percent Above 1990 Levels (1990+9%).</b> This case assumes that energy-related carbon emissions can reach an average of 1,467
              million metric tons in the commitment period, 9 percent above 1990 levels, an average
              reduction of 325 million metric tons from the reference case projection. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>Stabilization at 1990 Levels (1990).</b> This case assumes that carbon emissions are stabilized approximately at the 1990 level of
              1,346 million metric tons, averaging 1,345 million metric tons during the commitment
              period, a reduction of 447 million metric tons from the reference case. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>3 Percent Below 1990 Levels (1990-3%).</b> This case assumes that energy-related carbon emissions are reduced to an average of 1,307
              million metric tons in the commitment period. A reduction of 485 million metric tons from
              the reference case level is required. <br />
            </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>7 Percent Below 1990 Levels (1990-7%).</b> In this case, energy-related carbon emissions are reduced to an average of 1,250 million
              metric tons in the commitment period, a reduction of 542 million metric tons from the
              reference case projection. This case essentially assumes that energy-related carbon
              emissions must meet the 7-percent target in the Kyoto Protocol with no net offsets from
              sinks, other greenhouse gases, or international activities. </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Reductions in both the 1990-3%
            and 1990-7% cases would likely come from domestic actions only. The reductions in the
            other carbon reduction cases imply some international trade in carbon permits, CDM
            activity, or joint implementation projects, but this analysis does not address the shares
            that might result from international and domestic actions. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In each of the carbon
            reduction cases, the target is achieved on average for each of the years in the first
            commitment period, 2008 through 2012, in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol
            provides the flexibility for the target to be achieved on average over the 5-year
            commitment period, to accommodate short-term fluctuations that might occur, such as severe
            weather or unanticipated economic growth. Because the Protocol does not specify any
            targets beyond the first commitment period, the target is assumed to hold constant from
            2013 through 2020, the end of the NEMS forecast horizon. This assumption may be optimistic
            in that the possibility of further reductions has been advocated. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The target is assumed to be
            phased in over a 3-year period, beginning in 2005; that is, one-fourth of the reduction is
            imposed in 2005, one-half in 2006, and three-fourths in 2007. This analytical
            simplification allows energy markets to begin adjustments to meet the reduction targets in
            the absence of complete foresight, although a longer or delayed phase-in may lower the
            adjustment cost. Phase-in is also consistent with the requirement in the Protocol that
            countries achieve demonstrable progress toward the reductions by 2005; however, reductions
            prior to the commitment period are not credited against the required reductions. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Given the scope and potential
            costs of compliance with the reduction targets of the Protocol, there is a possibility
            that consumers might react differently&#151;either taking more immediate action or
            waiting. Consumers could begin to modify their energy decisions even before the 3-year
            phase-in period, either in anticipation of future price increases or because of a national
            commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. On the other hand, it is possible that consumers
            could delay actions either until or beyond energy price changes, taking a cautionary
            approach to the magnitude and duration of price increases or even anticipating a reversal
            of policy. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Although each of the six
            reduction cases is modeled using NEMS, the analysis in this report focuses on three of the
            cases, the 1990+24%, 1990+9%, and 1990-3% cases. Three cases are chosen in order to keep
            the subsequent presentation and discussion of the results manageable, particularly since
            many of the basic trends are the same across the reduction cases, varying only in the
            magnitude of the impact. Where there are specific trends to note in any of the other
            cases, they are included in the appropriate section of this report. The full results of
            each of the cases are presented in Appendix B, and results across all cases are presented
            graphically, where practical. Any of the reduction targets may be plausible; however, it
            is likely that some mitigation of the 7-percent target will be achieved through a
            combination of offsets from forestry and agriculture, reductions in other greenhouse

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Each of the carbon reduction
            targets is achieved by assuming that a carbon price is applied to the cost of energy,
            which could result from a carbon emissions permit system. The carbon price is applied to
            each of the energy fuels at its point of final consumption relative to its carbon content.
            Imported energy products receive the same carbon price at the point of consumption, but no
            carbon price is levied on other imported products. Of the fossil fuels, coal has the
            highest carbon content. Natural gas produces about half the carbon emissions of coal per
            unit of energy content. Average emissions from petroleum products are between those for
            coal and natural gas. Nuclear generation and renewable fuels produce no net carbon
            emissions. As an example, the carbon emissions factors and energy costs for a hypothetical
            carbon price of $100 dollars per metric ton are shown in <a href="tbl1.html">Table 1</a>. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Electricity produces no carbon
            emissions at the point of use; however, its generation currently produces about 35 percent
            of the total carbon emissions in the United States. The carbon price is applied to the
            fuels used to generate electricity, and the higher prices are reflected in the delivered
            price of electricity. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Placing a value on the carbon
            released during the combustion of fossil fuels affects energy consumption and emissions in
            three ways. First, consumers may reduce the demand for energy services by driving less,
            reducing the use of appliances, or shifting to less energy-intensive goods and services,
            as examples. Second, more energy-efficient equipment may be chosen, reducing the amount of
            energy required to meet the demand for energy services. Finally, there may be a shift to
            noncarbon or less carbon-intensive fuels, reducing the carbon released per unit of energy
            consumed. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the energy market analysis
            in this report, the carbon prices represent the marginal cost of reducing carbon emissions
            to the specified level or, conversely, the value of consuming the last metric ton of
            carbon. Although there may be a number of easy, low-cost options for reducing energy use
            and emissions, higher levels of reductions will require more expensive investment and
            changes in patterns of energy demand. The projected carbon prices reflect the price that
            the United States would be willing to pay to achieve a given emissions reduction target.
            The energy market analysis does not address the international implications of achieving a
            particular target at the projected carbon price. In the absence of modeling international
            trade of emissions permits, the energy market analysis makes no link between the U.S.
            carbon price and the international market-clearing price of permits, or the price at which
            other countries would be willing to offer permits for sale in the United States. </font></p>

            prices are used because they effect all three ways of reducing emissions&#151;demand
            reduction, improved efficiency, and fuel switching&#151;and may be the most efficient
            mechanism. Estimates of the carbon price necessary to achieve reductions vary widely.
            Lower estimates are suggested by those who assume that there are a number of low-cost
            options to reduce energy use or to shift to low-carbon or noncarbon fuels that are readily
            available and will be quickly adopted with higher energy prices. Higher estimates are
            suggested by analysts who think that the effective price of carbon-intensive fuels will
            have to be raised significantly to encourage changes in consumer choices and the

            impacts of the carbon reduction cases using the Data Resources, Inc. (DRI) Macroeconomic
            Model of the U.S. Economy. The DRI Model is a representation of the U.S. economy with
            detailed output, price, and financial sectors, incorporating gradual adjustment of the
            economy to policy changes. Macroeconomic models focus on adjustment processes of the
            economy associated with changing market conditions, including economic policies.
            Real-world economic behavior involves adapting to changes in conditions of supply and
            demand, which can lead to dislocations and less than optimal use of resources in the short
            run. Short-run movements in actual income are portrayed against projected long-run levels
            of potential output. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The linkage between the DRI
            macroeconomic model and NEMS is a set of energy variables. Twenty-seven energy variables
            in the DRI macroeconomic model are directly related to similar NEMS variables by ensuring
            that the DRI variables show the same percentage change from the baseline as the NEMS
            variables. These energy variables include energy prices, energy production, and energy
            consumption by different end uses, and the revenue from auctioned carbon permits. Energy
            prices include world oil prices; residential heating oil, electricity, and natural gas
            prices; transportation fuel prices for both diesel and gasoline; residual fuel oil prices;
            average refined oil price; wellhead natural gas price; and industrial coal and electricity
            prices. Coal, natural gas, and crude oil production from NEMS is used in the DRI
            macroeconomic model as well as the end-use demand for oil, natural gas, electricity, and
            coal. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Energy prices and end-use
            demands for fuels are the key energy inputs, along with the level of auctioned carbon
            revenues, because energy prices affect inflation, and the end-use fuel demand represents
            energy in the DRI aggregate production function, which describes the supply potential of
            the economy. The amount of auctioned carbon revenue dictates how much energy consumers can
            expect to receive as rebated revenue, which in turn affects disposable income. Changes in
            the values of these variables relative to the reference case would have major impacts on
            the macroeconomy. </font></p>

            competitive auction? If they are allocated, how will the initial allocations be made? If
            they are sold, what will be done with the revenues? How many permits will be bought in
            international markets? If the permits are traded in a free market, holders of permits who
            can reduce carbon emissions at a cost below the permit price will sell their permits, and
            those with higher costs of reduction will buy permits, resulting in a transfer of funds
            between private parties. If the permits are sold by competitive auction, there will be a
            transfer of funds from emitters of carbon to the Federal treasury. This analysis makes the

            target established by the Protocol is a 7-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
            relative to 1990 levels, the method of accounting for sinks and the flexibility to use
            1995 as the base year for the synthetic greenhouse gasses may mean that the reduction
            would be no more than 3 percent below 1990 levels, according to the U.S. State Department.
            The differences between the reduction level in the 1990-3% case and the reductions in the
            cases with higher levels of energy-related carbon emissions are assumed to be met by

            economy and calculates the equilibrium of the economy in the long term, abstracting from
            the short-run adjustment processes. Most often the time horizon of these models is much
            longer&#151;20, 50, or 100 years into the future. In contrast, the DRI macroeconomic model
            used in this analysis focuses on the adjustment of the economy over time, allowing for
            dislocations within the economy that yield less than optimal levels of economic activity.

            issue using CGE and macroeconomic models have often disagreed with each other over the
            concepts of the full employment GDP of the CGE models and the actual GDP measure presented
            in the macroeconomic models. Potential GDP is a concept calculated within the DRI Model

            influence on the United States. In particular, crude oil and petroleum products constitute
            an international market, and the world price of oil has a strong impact on consumption and
            production of oil in the United States. Conversely, U.S. demand for and production of oil
            affects the world price of oil. The feedback of U.S. oil markets on international markets
            is represented within the NEMS framework. World oil prices are determined by means of a
            price reaction function, assuming that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries

            percent that the United States reduces oil demand from the reference case level. Oil
            consumption in non-Annex I countries is assumed to respond to changes in the world price

            portion of U.S. coal production, with exports going to both Annex I and non-Annex I

            production and imports in Western Europe and coal imports in Japan would be reduced and
            that coal consumption in those countries would be reduced by more than their emissions
            reductions in the Protocol. In the target cases where U.S. carbon emissions are allowed to
            rise above 1990 levels in 2010, U.S. steam coal exports to Europe in 2010 are assumed to
            be lower by 16 million tons, and exports to Asia are 4 million tons lower than in the
            reference case. In the more stringent target cases, exports to Europe and Asia are 26 and
            7 million tons lower, respectively, in 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >As a result of the Kyoto

            is possible that more energy-intensive industries could shift from those countries with
            higher energy costs. Energy-intensive industries also may face reduced demand as consumers
            shift their consumption patterns to less energy-intensive goods and services.
            Consequently, the composition of U.S. industrial output is likely to change toward the
            less energy-intensive industries. Because this analysis does not cover international
            energy markets, international trade, or the international activities of the Protocol, a
            complete analysis of potential changes in U.S. industrial output is not possible (for

            average of 1.9 percent a year between 1996 and 2020. The same assumption is used in all
            the carbon reduction cases in this analysis, although there is a feedback within the NEMS
            framework that alters the baseline economic assumptions as a result of changes in energy
            prices. Therefore, as emissions reductions become more stringent and the resulting carbon

            could occur beyond those represented in the high technology sensitivity case if a very
            aggressive research and development effort were established. Innovative, breakthrough
            technologies not foreseen in the analysis of technology could also be developed and lead
            to improvements beyond those represented in the high technology assessment, but limited

                  considerably less than the decline in the 1970s and early 1980s, which averaged 2.3
                  percent a year between 1970 and 1986. Approximately half the decline in energy intensity
                  during that period resulted from shifts in the economy to service industries and other
                  less energy-intensive industries; however, the other half of the decline was due to the
                  use of more energy-efficient technologies, resulting, in part, from the rapid escalation
                  in the price of energy from the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s. The decline in energy
                  intensity slowed during the late 1980s and early 1990s as the growth in energy prices
                  slowed and growth in some energy-intensive industries resumed. In the reference case

                  equipment; however, other factors also influence equipment choice. More advanced,
                  energy-efficient technology is typically more expensive than standard equipment. The
                  methodology for technology choice accounts for the relative roles of first cost and energy
                  cost savings over the life of the equipment through the use of the discount rate, the
                  implied payback period for the consumer who is considering the choice of more efficient
                  equipment. Perceived consumer preferences are also a factor in technology choice&#151;for
                  example, preferences for larger, higher horsepower vehicles and larger televisions, and
                  for purchases of new heating equipment that uses the same fuel as the equipment it
                  replaces. Improvements in energy intensity can be slowed by continued growth in energy
                  services&#151;more travel, household appliances, and office equipment, larger homes, and
                  higher industrial output&#151;some of which are assumed to respond to energy prices. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the carbon reduction cases,
                  energy prices rise with increasingly stringent reduction targets. Intensity improvements
                  in those cases result both from reductions in energy service demand and from the choice of
                  more efficient equipment as a result of higher prices. These cases use the same
                  assumptions of technology availability and characteristics. Additional research and
                  development in energy-efficient or alternatively fueled technologies would likely expand
                  the slate of choices available to consumers, leading to further improvements in energy
                  efficiency. The high technology case explores the impacts of improvements in the
                  availability, characteristics, and costs of technology as a result of increased research
                  and development, thus separating the impacts of energy prices and technology development. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The nuclear power sensitivity
            case examines the role of nuclear generation in reducing carbon emissions. In <i>AEO98</i>,
            electricity generation from nuclear plants declines significantly over the forecast
            period. It is assumed that 65 units, about 51 percent of the total nuclear capacity
            available in 1996, will be retired by 2020. Twenty-four units are assumed to be retired
            before the end of their 40-year operating licenses, based on industry announcements and
            analysis of the age and operating costs of the units. No new nuclear plants are

            technologies. In the 1990+9% case, nuclear plants are not projected to be economically
            competitive with other plants. They do become competitive, however, with the higher carbon
            prices projected in the 1990-3% case. Therefore, this sensitivity case is analyzed against
            the 1990-3% case. </font></p>

            in both <i>AEO98</i> and this analysis represent business-as-usual trend forecasts, given
            known trends in technology and demographics, current laws and regulations, and the
            specific methodologies and assumptions used by EIA. Because EIA does not include future
            legislative and regulatory changes in its reference case projections, the projections
            provide a policy-neutral baseline against which the impacts of policy initiatives can be
            analyzed. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Results from any model or
            analysis are highly uncertain. By their nature, energy models are simplified
            representations of complex energy markets. On the other hand, models provide a structured
            accounting framework that allows analysts to capture the interrelationships of a complex
            system in a consistent manner. Also, the assumptions and data underlying a model can be
            explicitly cited, in contrast to a more <i>ad hoc</i> analysis. The results of any
            analysis depend on the specific data, assumptions, behavioral characteristics,
            methodologies, and model structures included. In addition, many of the factors that will
            influence the future development of energy markets are inherently uncertain, including
            weather, political and economic disruptions, technology development, and policy
            initiatives. Recognizing these uncertainties, EIA has attempted in this study to isolate
            and analyze the most important factors affecting future carbon emissions and carbon
            prices. The results of the various cases and sensitivities should be considered in terms
            of the relative changes from the baseline cases with which they are compared. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >It has been suggested that
            models may be inherently pessimistic in analyzing the potential impacts of policy changes.
            For example, in the <i>Annual Energy Outlook 1993</i> (<i>AEO93</i>),<a href="fnote1.html#20"><sup>20</sup></a> the first EIA analysis of CAAA90 compliance, the
            cost of a SO<sub>2</sub> allowance was projected to be $423 a ton in 2000, in 1996
            dollars, rising to $751 a ton in 2010. Currently, the cost of an allowance is $95 a ton,
            and <i>AEO98</i> projects that the cost will be $121 a ton in 2000 and $189 in 2010.
            Projected coal prices in <i>AEO98</i> are 34 and 48 percent lower in 2000 and 2010,
            respectively, than those projected in <i>AEO93</i>, reflecting recent improvements in mine
            design and technology, economies of scale in the mining industry, and lower transportation
            costs induced by rail competition. There has been more fuel switching to low-sulfur,
            low-cost Western coal than previously anticipated (it was initially assumed that many
            eastern coal-fired plants would not be able to burn western coal without considerable loss
            of performance). There has also been downward pressure on short-run allowance costs
            because generators have taken actions to comply with the SO<sub>2</sub> limitations
            earlier than anticipated.<a href="fnote1.html#21"><sup>21</sup></a> Finally, technology
            improvements have lowered the costs of flue-gas desulfurization technologies, or
            scrubbers, from $313 per kilowatt for scrubber retrofitting as assumed in 1993 to $191 per
            kilowatt in 1998. The cost of SO<sub>2</sub> compliance was overestimated to a large
            extent because compliance relied on scrubbing, a relatively new technology with which
            there was little experience. On the other hand, the current analysis of carbon reduction
            does not rely on a single technology but rather on fuel switching and efficiency
            improvements, both issues of long experience in energy markets. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In contrast, however, analyses
            of policies can also be too optimistic. As noted earlier, reductions in greenhouse gas
            emissions as a result of CCAP have been overestimated. In addition, some early analyses of
            the potentially beneficial impacts of price controls on oil and natural gas proved in
            error because of the negative effects on production and competition in the industry. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >A number of uncertainties may
            affect the costs of achieving emissions reductions. As previously noted, the
            interpretation and implementation of many provisions of the Kyoto Protocol are
            undetermined at this time. The flexibility allowed by the international activities may
            considerably lower the costs of the Protocol. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The availability and costs of
            technology remain one of the more significant factors in determining the cost of emissions
            reductions, and this analysis seeks to quantify that uncertainty to some degree with low
            
            and high technology sensitivity cases. Although it is sometimes hypothesized that more
            cost-effective technologies are developed once the requirements are established, it must
            be noted that the cost and availability of some of the more advanced technologies in the
            reference case are not certain, and even the reference assumptions may be optimistic. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Although the Kyoto Protocol
            specifies reduction targets, signature and ratification by the United States would need to
            be followed by the formulation of policies and programs to achieve the carbon reductions.
            This analysis has chosen one possible mechanism, the imposition of a carbon fee with
            revenue recycling by two alternative methods. Other programs&#151;voluntary initiatives,
            mandatory standards, or other nonmarket policies&#151;could result in higher or lower
            costs. Even with a carbon fee, other fiscal policies for recycling the revenues, including
            not recycling, are likely to have different impacts on the U.S. economy. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The timing of policy
            initiatives may also be an important factor in the cost of emissions reductions. Given
            that the Kyoto Protocol includes a specific timetable for reducing emissions, policies and
            initiatives that begin earlier may allow for more gradual adoption and a less costly
            transition, particularly if consumers react with foresight of anticipated price increases
            and emissions restrictions. Consumer response to anticipated or realized price increases
            and other policy initiatives is likely to be another significant determinant of the cost
            of the Kyoto Protocol. Finally, other energy policies formulated for purposes other than
            the Protocol, such as electricity industry restructuring and other emissions controls, may
            have ancillary impacts on carbon emissions. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the next chapter, Chapter
            2, the results from the carbon emissions reduction cases and the sensitivity cases are
            summarized. Chapters 3 through 6 present more detailed analysis of the results for the
            
            end-use demand sectors, electricity generation, fossil fuel markets, and the macroeconomy,
            respectively. Chapter 7 concludes with a comparison of this analysis and similar studies
