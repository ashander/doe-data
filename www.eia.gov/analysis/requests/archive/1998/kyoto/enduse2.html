<title>EIA - Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets & Economic Activity</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Background</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The industrial sector includes
            agriculture, mining, construction, and manufacturing activities. The sector consumes
            energy as an input to processes that produce the goods that are familiar to consumers,
            such as cars and computers. The industrial sector also produces a wide range of basic
            materials, such as cement and steel, that are used to produce goods for final consumption.
            Energy is an especially important input to the production processes of industries that
            produce basic materials. Typically, the industries that are energy-intensive are also
            capital-intensive. Industries within the sector compete among themselves and with foreign
            producers for sales to consumers. Consequently, variations in input prices can have
            significant competitive impacts. The most significant determinant of industrial energy
            consumption is demand for final output. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Although energy is an
            important factor of production, it is not large in terms of annual manufacturing
            expenditures. In 1995, for example, purchased energy expenditures were 2.3 percent of
            annual manufacturing outlays.<a href="fnote1.html#41"><sup>41</sup></a> Technology usually
            plays a minor role in the pattern of energy consumption, because technology tends to be
            used to produce new and improved final products rather than to reduce energy consumption;
            however, when new investments are undertaken to introduce improved production technology,
            steps to increase energy efficiency also are undertaken. Overall, energy prices and
            technological breakthroughs tend to have a rather small impact on industrial energy
            consumption.<a href="fnote1.html#42"><sup>42</sup></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The influence of energy prices
            on industrial energy consumption is modeled in terms of the efficiency of use of existing
            capital, the efficiency of new capital additions, and the mix of fuels used. This analysis
            uses &#147;technology bundles&#148; to characterize technological change in the
            energy-intensive industries. This approach is dictated by the number and complexity of
            processes used in the industrial sector and the absence of systematic cost and performance
            data for the components. These bundles are defined for each production process step (e.g.,
            coke ovens) for five of the industries and for end use (e.g., refrigeration) in two of the
            industries. The process-step industries in the NEMS model are pulp and paper, glass,
            cement, steel, and aluminum.<a href="fnote1.html#43"><sup>43</sup></a> The industries for
            which technology bundles are defined by end use are food and bulk chemicals. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The rate at which the average
            industrial energy intensity declines is determined primarily by the rate and timing of
            additions to manufacturing capacity. The rate and timing of additions are functions of
            retirement rates and industry growth rates. Typical retirement rates range from 1 percent
            to 3 percent annually. The current model also allows retirement rates and the energy
            intensity of new additions to vary as a function of price. Price elasticity of demand,
            which indicates the responsiveness of energy consumption to changes in energy prices, is
            not an explicit assumption in the model; however, the typical 20-year price elasticity
            ranges between -0.2 and -0.3, which indicates that a 1-percent price increase would reduce
            demand by 0.2 to 0.3 percent. Because the reference case approximates a constant price
            regime, the reference case results do not differ greatly from a situation in which all
            prices are held constant. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1996, the industrial
            sector&#146;s consumption of 34.6 quadrillion Btu accounted for more than one-third of all
            U.S. energy consumption. The associated emissions of 476 million metric tons of carbon
            accounted for one-third of all U.S. carbon emissions. In 1996, although industrial energy
            prices were more than 50 percent lower than in 1980 (<a href="pdf/c3graph5.pdf">Figure 44</a>),
            delivered energy consumption was only 13 percent higher than in 1980. Industrial output
            increased by more than 30 percent over that period. As a result, energy intensity
            (thousand Btu consumed per dollar of output) fell by 20 percent. <br />
            <br />
            Most of the drop in energy intensity in the U.S. industrial sector occurred between 1980
            and 1985, when prices for both energy and capital inputs were rising and the ability of
            U.S. manufacturers to compete internationally was deteriorating. The recessions of 1980
            and 1981-1982 forced many less efficient plants to close, many permanently. Particularly
            hard hit were the primary metals industries and motor vehicle manufacturing. Output of the
            U.S. steel industry has never recovered to the levels of the late 1970s. Manufacturing
            profits did not return to the levels attained in 1981 until 1988<a href="fnote1.html#44">.<sup>44</sup></a> Energy prices certainly played a role in shaping these changes in the industrial sector,
            but general economic conditions, recession, record high interest rates, and reduced
            ability of key industries to compete in international markets were more important
            determinants of change<a href="fnote1.html#45">.<sup>45</sup></a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the reference case,
            industrial energy prices are projected to increase very slightly or fall through 2010. For
            example, the price of natural gas is projected to increase by 0.5 percent, and the price
            of electricity is projected to fall by 16 percent. From 1996 to 2010, industrial output is
            projected to grow by 39 percent and energy consumption by only 16 percent. Industrial
            intensity falls by 17 percent during the same period, approximating the intensity decline
            between 1980 and 1996. The factors that are expected to produce the rapid decline in
            industrial energy intensity despite moderate changes in energy prices include a relative
            shift from energy-intensive to less energy-intensive industries; replacement of existing
            equipment with less energy-intensive equipment as existing capacity is retired; adoption
            of improved and less energy-intensive technologies; and the pressures of international
            competition. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Carbon Reduction Cases</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the carbon reduction cases,
            the combined effect of reduced demand for U.S. industrial output and higher energy prices
            produces lower energy consumption than in the reference case. Compared with the reference
            case in 2010, industrial output is $69 billion (1 percent) lower in the 1990+24% case,
            $157 billion (3 percent) lower in the 1990+9% case, and $308 billion (6 percent) lower in
            the 1990-3% case (see <a href="tbl29.html">Table 29 in Chapter 6</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Compared with the reference
            case, average energy prices in the industrial sector in 2010 are projected to be 22
            percent higher in the 1990+24% case, 55 percent higher in the 1990+9% case, and 95 percent
            higher in the 1990-3% case. In comparison, the industrial sector&#146;s average energy
            price increased by almost 189 percent from 1970 to 1980. Prices of all fuels are projected
            to be higher in the carbon reduction cases, with coal prices 135 percent higher than the
            reference case in 2010 in the 1990+24% case and natural gas prices 33 percent higher. The
            projected price increase for coal is attributable solely to the projected carbon price,
            whereas the carbon price and higher demand contribute about equally to the increase for
            natural gas. In the 1990+9% case, natural gas and coal prices are projected to be 93
            percent and 328 percent higher, respectively, than in the reference case, and in the
            1990-3% case they are 162 percent and 589 percent higher. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Lower projections of
            industrial output and higher projected energy prices reduce the projections for delivered
            energy consumption in the industrial sector by 0.7&nbsp;quadrillion Btu (2 percent) in the
            1990+24% case, by 1.3 quadrillion Btu (4 percent) in the 1990+9% case, and by 2.3
            quadrillion Btu (7 percent) in the 1990-3% case in 2010 relative to the reference case (<a href="pdf/c3graph5.pdf">Figure 45</a>). In the 1970-1980 period, industrial consumption
            was unchanged even though prices increased by 189 percent. Year-to-year industrial energy
            consumption began to fall in 1980, and the decline accelerated when general economic
            conditions began to deteriorate during the 1980 and 1981-1982 recessions. Energy
            consumption reached its minimum in 1983, even though prices had begun to decline. These
            events reinforce the concept that while energy prices do play a role in industrial energy
            consumption, general and industry-specific economic conditions also play an important
            role. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Coal consumption is projected
            to drop sharply in the carbon reduction cases, given its extreme price disadvantage. In
            the 1990+24% case, coal consumption in 2010 is lower by 422 trillion Btu (16 percent) than
            in the reference case; in the 1990+9% case it is 737 trillion Btu (28 percent) lower; and
            in the 1990-3% case it is about 1 quadrillion Btu (36 percent) lower. The projected
            reductions in coal consumption are predominantly due to projected reductions in boiler
            fuel use. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The industrial sector consumes
            coal mainly as a boiler fuel and for production of coke in the iron and steel industry.
            For example, 75 percent of manufacturing consumption of steam coal was used in boilers in
            1994.<a href="fnote1.html#46"><sup>46</sup></a> Coal-fired boilers have substantially
            higher capital costs than do gas-fired boilers, because of their materials handling
            requirements. For large steam loads, however, coal&#146;s price advantage over natural gas
            offsets its capital cost disadvantage. But in the carbon reduction cases, coal suffers
            from both a capital cost and a fuel cost disadvantage. As a result, a substantial amount
            of boiler fuel use switches from coal to natural gas and petroleum products. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The projected reduction in
            total steam coal consumption in the industrial sector in 2010 (including for uses other
            than boiler fuel) in the 1990-3% case relative to the reference case is more than 50
            percent. Still, the reduction is less severe than that projected for the electric utility
            sector. Electricity generators, in addition to switching to natural gas, also have the
            available options of nuclear power and renewable energy sources. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumption of metallurgical
            coal, which is used to produce coke for iron and steel production, also is reduced sharply
            in the carbon reduction cases. The reduction has several causes: substitution of natural
            gas in production processes, replacement of domestic coke production with coke imports,
            replacement of some coke-based steelmaking capacity with electricity-based capacity, and
            reduced production of domestic steel. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the carbon reduction cases,
            natural gas consumption is subject to two countervailing effects. The effect of generally
            higher energy prices, and consequent lower levels of industrial activity, is to reduce
            natural gas consumption. On the other hand, natural gas prices do not increase by as much
            as the prices of competing fuels. As noted above, this results in relatively greater use
            of natural gas as a boiler fuel. The carbon reduction cases also induce additional
            cogeneration using natural gas, which increases natural gas consumption and reduces
            requirements for other boiler fuels. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the 1990+24% and 1990+9%
            cases, natural gas consumption is projected to increase slightly, because the impact of
            increased boiler fuel use outweighs the reduction caused by lower industrial output. In
            the 1990-3% case, natural gas consumption is unchanged from the reference case in 2010.
            Here, the drop in industrial output and the substitution for other boiler fuels have
            offsetting effects. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the reference case,
            industrial carbon emissions are projected to be 83 million metric tons higher in 2010 than
            they were in 1996 (<a href="pdf/c3graph5.pdf">Figure 46</a>). Emissions attributable to
            increased electricity consumption account for more than half the increase. In contrast,
            electricity-based emissions account for more than 70 percent of the emissions reductions
            in the carbon cases. For example, in the 1990+9% case, electricity-based carbon emissions
            in 2010 are 79 million metric tons lower than in the reference case. A reduction of 19
            million metric tons in carbon emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels brings
            industrial sector emissions to approximately their 1990 level. Carbon emissions in the
            1990-3% case fall to 418 million metric tons, 58 million tons below the 1996 level and 35
            million tons below the 1990 level. Again, electricity-based emissions account for
            three-fourths of the reduction from projected levels in the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Part of the reduction in
            electricity-based carbon emissions for the industrial sector is due to lower electricity
            consumption in the carbon reduction cases (<a href="pdf/c3graph6.pdf">Figure 47</a>). A
            larger part of the reduction results from sharply lower carbon intensity of electricity
            production. In the reference case, approximately 16.5 million metric tons of carbon are
            emitted in the production of 1 quadrillion Btu of delivered electrical energy, as compared
            with only 12.6 million metric tons in the 1990+9% case and only 10.2 million metric tons
            in the 1990-3% case (38 percent less than in the reference case). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Industrial energy intensity
            fell by 17 percent between 1980 and 1996. In 1996, approximately 7,100 Btu of energy was
            required to produce a dollar&#146;s worth of industrial output. In the reference case
            energy intensity continues to fall, and in 2010 it is projected that only 5,900 Btu will
            be required for each dollar of industrial output. The impact of the carbon reduction cases
            on industrial energy intensity results from opposing effects. The effect of higher energy
            prices is to reduce energy intensity, whereas reduced or falling output growth limits the
            amount of new, less energy-intensive capital equipment that will be added to the existing
            stock, thereby retarding the rate of decline in energy intensity. Additional structural
            shifts in the composition of industrial output further reduce energy intensity. (Fuel
            switching contributes to reduced carbon but does not affect energy intensity.) </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The projected rate of decline
            in industrial energy intensity is smaller in the more stringent carbon reduction cases (<a href="pdf/c3graph6.pdf">Figure 48)</a>. Some process steps in the energy-intensive
            industries approach the minimum level of energy intensity assumed to be practically
            achievable. In addition, in the more stringent carbon reduction cases, industrial output
            is more severely reduced, resulting in smaller incentives for the addition of new, less
            energy-intensive capital equipment. The changes in energy intensity for the industrial
            subsectors (<a href="pdf/c3graph6.pdf">Figure 49</a>) indicate that slower growth in
            output can lead to less pronounced declines in energy intensity in the more stringent
            carbon reduction cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The change in aggregate
            industrial energy intensity can be decomposed into two effects. One is the change in
            energy intensity that results from a change in the composition of industrial output. For
            example, if the output of the most energy-intensive industries grows more slowly than
            other parts of the industrial sector, aggregate energy intensity will fall even though no
            individual industry&#146;s energy intensity has changed. This is the
            &#147;structural&#148; effect. The other is increased energy efficiency and shifts toward
            less energy-intensive products in individual industries (the &#147;efficiency/ other&#148;
            
            effect). The relative contributions of these two effects to the reduction in aggregate
            industrial intensity have varied substantially over time (<a href="pdf/c3graph6.pdf">Figure
              50</a>).<a href="fnote1.html#47"><sup>47</sup></a> For example, between 1980 and 1985,
            when aggregate industrial intensity fell by 3.6 percent annually, the structural and
            efficiency/other effects made equal contributions to the decline. Over a longer period,
            from 1980 to 1996, the structural effects dominated the reduction in aggregate industrial
            energy intensity. Similarly, in the projections, the structural and efficiency/other
            effects can be decomposed. About two-thirds of the projected reduction in aggregate
            industrial intensity is attributable to the structural effect, which is slightly larger in
            the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Total expenditures for energy
            purchases in the industrial sector are projected to be $121 billion in 2010 in the
            reference case. In the carbon reduction cases, the effects of higher energy prices are
            reduced by fuel switching and reduced consumption. Nevertheless, energy expenditures in
            2010 are projected to be $24 billion (20 percent) higher in the 1990+24% case and $60
            billion (50 percent) higher in the 1990+9% case than in the reference case, and in the
            1990-3% case they are projected to be even higher&#151;$101 billion (83 percent) higher
            than in the reference case at $222 billion (<a href="pdf/c3graph7.pdf">Figure 51</a>). </font></p>

            technology changes (as reflected in energy intensity) will occur after 1998. Normal
            turnover of capital, however, would result in some decline in energy intensity as old
            equipment is replaced with currently available equipment with lower energy intensity. The
            high technology case assumes an aggressive private and Federal commitment to
            energy-related research and development, which results in successful commercialization of

                Systems</b></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">A key issue facing power
                  producers and their customers is whether the types of cogeneration systems currently used
                  in the United States will be extended to include district energy systems and advanced
                  turbine systems (ATS). Cogeneration systems, also called combined heat and power systems,
                  simultaneously produce heat in the form of hot air or steam and power in the form of
                  electricity by a single thermodynamic process, usually steam boilers or gas turbines,
                  reducing the energy losses that occur when process steam and electricity are produced
                  independently. Thus, cogeneration systems could play a significant role in reducing U.S.
                  greenhouse gas emissions. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1996, electric utilities
                  used more than 21 quadrillion Btu of energy from the combustion of coal, natural gas, and
                  oil to produce the equivalent of only 7 quadrillion Btu of electricity available at the
                  plant gate, representing a conversion loss of 67 percent.<sup>a</sup> Consequently, unused
                  waste heat at utility plants accounted for 346 million metric tons or nearly 24 percent of
                  U.S. carbon emissions in 1996. Additional losses on the order of 7 percent are incurred
                  during transmission and distribution of electricity to customers.<sup>b</sup> Because
                  cogeneration systems capture and use a significant portion of the waste heat energy, they
                  are nearly twice as efficient as conventional power plants in extracting usable energy.
                  About 6 percent of total U.S. generating capacity includes some type of cogeneration
                  system, in such diverse industries as manufacturing, mining, and refining.<sup>c</sup></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some energy analysts believe
                  that there is even greater potential to increase the penetration of cogeneration systems
                  and reduce carbon emissions by wide-scale construction of district energy systems.<sup>b</sup> District energy systems distribute chilled water, steam, or hot water to buildings to
                  provide air conditioning, space heating, domestic hot water, and industrial process
                  energy. About 5,800 district energy systems are installed in the United States, serving
                  
                  more than 8 percent of commercial floorspace&#151;primarily military bases, universities,
                  hospitals, downtown areas, and other group buildings.<sup>d</sup></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The greatest growth potential
                  for district energy systems is in the area of utility-financed cooling systems for
                  downtown areas where there is a large amount of commercial floorspace located in a
                  relatively small area; however, </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">significant hurdles must be
                  overcome if the potential is to be realized. Siting one or more power and steam generators
                  in an area already dense with buildings could prove to be a challenge, as could the
                  installation, maintenance, and repair of lines to carry steam and hot or chilled water
                  supplies in cities with under-street congestion of existing gas, water, sewage, and
                  electricity lines. Also, construction costs for district energy systems are about
                  one-third higher than those for conventional generating technologies. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Although it is possible that
                  
                  fuel cost savings over the life of a district energy plant could offset its higher initial
                  construction cost, electricity producers might be reluctant to invest significant capital
                  during a period of regulatory reform. Even after the current restructuring process in U.S.
                  electricity markets is completed, the risk of nonrecovery of capital for capital-intensive
                  technologies in a competitive environment will make finding investors in such projects a
                  challenge. Moreover, the development of a district energy system involves the coordinated
                  effort of local and State governments, investors, and the community as a whole, together
                  with the subsequent legal, financial, and environmental issues that arise with the
                  inclusion of many and diverse stakeholders. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Another technology that some
                  energy analysts believe could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the
                  next-generation, very-high-efficiency ATS. These turbines are expected to operate, at
                  minimum, 5 to 10 percent more efficiently than steam boilers and to cost less than $350
                  per kilowatthour when used as a simple-cycle turbine.<sup>b</sup> Their small size (5
                  megawatts) and short construction and delivery schedule (18 months) result in relatively
                  smaller capital outlays and faster capital recovery, which are expected to give them an
                  economic advantage over large central-station turbines. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Commercialization of ATS
                  turbines is not expected until 2001, and penetration is expected to occur first where
                  there is a need to satisfy internal power and steam requirements at industrial and large
                  commercial establishments. But large-scale penetration of the ATS technology as envisioned
                  by its advocates depends on the development of a significant niche market for this
                  cogeneration system&#151;a market characterized as having a small, but not constant,
                  demand for steam. ATS in electric-only mode may not be competitive with other primary
                  power technologies, and a constant demand for steam could be satisfied more economically
                  by conventional gas and combined-cycle steam boilers.<sup>b</sup> Consequently, the
                  competitiveness of ATS with other generating technologies depends on locating markets with
                  
                  an optimal demand for steam during part of the day and maximum demand for electricity for
                  the remainder of the day, even during off-peak periods. Few, if any, power markets would
                  meet such stringent criteria. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the 1990+9% low technology
            case, industrial energy expenditures in 2010 are projected to be nearly double those in
            the 1990+9% carbon reduction case and $110 billion higher than those in the reference
            case. In the high technology sensitivity case, energy expenditures are projected to be
            only $23 billion higher than in the reference case, which has no carbon reductions, in
            2010. The high technology case reduces, but does not eliminate, the impact of higher
            energy prices, producing $37 billion in savings attributable to the assumed technology
            advances <a href="pdf/c3graph7.pdf">(Figure 51</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Another sensitivity case for
            the 1990+9% carbon reduction case was implemented to examine the impacts of alternative
            assumptions about the use of cogeneration and biomass for electricity generation. These
            assumptions reflect the possibility that natural gas cogeneration and biomass could be
            used more extensively than projected in the other cases. Natural-gas-fired cogeneration is
            posited to be a function of two economic factors. One is demand for process steam, with
            
            higher demand leading to more cogeneration. (In the carbon reduction cases, industrial
            steam demand is reduced because the requirements for process steam fall when industrial
            output falls.) The other is the spread between electricity and natural gas prices, with a
            higher price difference leading to more gas-fired cogeneration. The assumption used here
            is that natural-gas-fired cogeneration is more responsive to increasing prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Industrial biomass consumption
            is dominated by activities in the pulp and paper industry, where biomass residue and
            pulping liquor are used to supply more than half the industry&#146;s energy requirements.
            Consumption of biomass residue and pulping liquor is a function of the industry&#146;s
            output. Consequently, biomass consumption tends to fall in the carbon reduction cases,
            because industrial output is projected to be lower. The 1990+9% aggressive
            cogeneration/biomass sensitivity case assumes that the reduction in biomass consumption
            will be attenuated by additional biomass recovery and utilization. Additional biomass
            recovery also leads to an increase in cogeneration from biomass, which further reduces the
            requirements for other fossil fuels. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The aggressive
            cogeneration/biomass case results in a 9-percent increase (20 billion kilowatthours) in
            the level of gas-fired cogeneration in 2010 relative to the reference case (<a href="pdf/c3graph7.pdf">Figure 52).</a> This is smaller than the change seen in the high
            technology sensitivity case, because industrial output is lower in the aggressive
            cogeneration/biomass sensitivity than in the high technology case. (Industrial output is
            lower in the aggressive cogeneration case than in the high technology case, because the
            projected energy prices are higher in the aggressive cogeneration case.) Biomass
            consumption in 2010 is projected to be 1.2 percent (27 trillion Btu) higher in the
            aggressive cogeneration/biomass sensitivity case than in the reference case (Figure 52).
            As with cogeneration, this increase is slightly less than the change seen in the high
            technology sensitivity case, again because of the lower industrial output projected in the
            aggressive cogeneration/ biomass case. Projected energy expenditures in the industrial
            sector in 2010 in this sensitivity case are $15 billion less than in the 1990+9% case. It
            should be noted that neither the cost nor the likelihood of achieving the assumed changes
            in the high technology or aggressive cogeneration/biomass sensitivity case has been
            evaluated. Instead, the experiments were an attempt to span the range of possible
            outcomes. </font></p>

                  are not required to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, their energy prices are
                  likely to be lower than those in the Annex I countries, including the United States. As a
                  result, more energy-intensive industries could migrate from areas with high energy costs,
                  and those that remain could lose markets to lower-cost foreign competition.
                  Energy-intensive industries also may face reduced demand as consumers shift their
                  consumption patterns to less energy-intensive goods and services. There are several
                  counter arguments to this hypothesis: the relatively small share of energy expenditures in
                  annual manufacturing expenditures makes the impact of differential energy prices
                  relatively unimportant; energy prices are not important determinants of international
                  trade or capital flows, which implies that U.S. energy-intensive industries are not likely
                  to be seriously affected by an energy price disadvantage; and a large number of business
                  opportunities related to climate change mitigation will become available both domestically
                  and in non-Annex I countries. Needless to say, there are widely divergent points of view
                  about the likelihood of significant industrial migration and the extent of adverse impacts
                  on U.S. industry.<sup>a</sup> An analysis of the change in industrial composition, which
                  would require an analysis of all the relative costs of manufacturing inputs, of which

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">One published study has
                  attempted to evaluate the potential effects of differential changes in international
                  energy prices on the U.S. industrial sector. The study was conducted by Argonne National
                  Laboratory in a workshop format (see Argonne National Laboratory, <i>The Impact of High
                    Energy Price Cases on Energy-Intensive Sectors: Perspectives from Industry Workshops</i> (July 1997)). Industry-specific discussion papers circulated to workshop participants
                  contained analyses that examined impacts for each individual industry, assuming no price
                  changes for other industries or markets. The industries affected and the percentage
                  reductions in projected industrial output in the reference case were as follows: bulk
                  chemicals, 28.5; aluminum, 13.7; pulp and paper, 10.2; steel, 30.5; and cement, 38.2. </font></p>

                  at EIA&#146;s request by Charles River Associates (CRA),<sup>b</sup> using a more general
                  approach. Explicit linkages to international trade were a fundamental part of the modeling
                  framework for the study, which was conducted under assumptions similar to those of the
                  1990+14% carbon reduction case in this analysis. The industries affected and the
                  percentage reductions from reference case output projections were as follows: total
                  chemicals, 3.9; nonferrous metals, 1.5; pulp and paper plus printing, 0.7; steel, 1.4; and
                  nonmetallic minerals, 1.4. The percentage output reductions from the comparable NEMS case
                  (1990+14%) are about double the CRA values: nonferrous metals, 4.4; pulp and paper plus
                  printing, 2.0; steel, 3.1; and nonmetallic minerals, 3.5. The exception is total chemicals
                  for which the NEMS results project a slightly smaller reduction of 3.5 percent. The
                  projections from NEMS, which estimates only domestic output reductions, and from CRA,
                  which treated both international capital flows and domestic output reductions, are
                  significantly lower than those from the Argonne National Laboratory study. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In view of the above results,
                  it is difficult to distinguish the effects of reduced output from those that could result
                  from industrial migration abroad in response to differences in international energy
                  prices. There are many analytical complexities in the assessment of potential effects of
                  carbon reductions on industrial output. A complete analysis of the issue would require
                  consideration of all input costs, including infrastructure and locational advantages,
                  monetary issues, and trade issues. Significant additional research would be required to

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In terms of primary energy use
            in 1996, transportation sector carbon emissions, which almost equaled industrial carbon
            emission levels, were the second highest among the end-use demand sectors. Nearly 33
            percent of all carbon emissions and 78 percent of carbon emissions from petroleum
            consumption originate from the transportation sector. In the reference case, carbon
            emissions from transportation are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.9
            percent to 2010, compared with 1.4 percent for the commercial sector and 1.2 percent for
            both the residential and industrial sectors. In addition, transportation is the only
            sector with increasing carbon emissions projected for the period from 2010 to 2020 in the
            carbon reduction cases. Therefore, if there are no specific initiatives to reduce carbon
            emissions in the transportation sector, especially beyond 2010, increasing pressure may
            have to be exerted in the other sectors in order to reach and then maintain 2010 carbon
            emissions targets beyond 2010. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Consumers select light-duty
            vehicles (cars, vans, pick-up trucks, and sport utility vehicles) based on a number of
            attributes: size, horsepower, price, and cost of driving; weighting these attributes by
            their personal preferences. This analysis uses past experience to determine the weights
            that each of these attributes have in terms of consumer preferences for conventional
            vehicles. Technologies are represented by component (e.g., front wheel drive, electronic
            transmission type) with each technology component defined by a date of introduction, a
            cost, and a weight that indicates its impact on efficiency and horsepower. The vehicles
            are categorized by the 12 size classes for cars and light trucks defined by the
            Environmental Protection Agency and includes 2 conventional engine technologies, and 14
            alternative fuel vehicle engine technologies. Technologies penetrate based on both their
            cost-effectiveness and by consumer preference based on past experience with similar
            technologies in the automotive industry. Consumers are assumed to consider only current
            energy prices when evaluating technologies. However, it is assumed that the automobile
            industry requires 3 years for minor technology makeovers and 5 years for major redesigns,
            estimating future fuel prices based on their rate of growth in the past 3 to 5 years.
            Therefore, manufacturers consider whether future fuel prices will enable their
            technologies to be cost-effective from a consumer standpoint. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Penetration of
            alternative-fuel vehicles is based on four consumer criteria&#151;vehicle price, cost of
            driving per mile, vehicle range, and availability of refueling stations. Each of these
            attributes is weighted according to consumer surveys and expected changes over the
            forecast period as a result of technological improvements, larger scales of production,
            the availability and cost of fuel-saving technologies, and the availability of
            alternative-fuel refueling stations as more alternative-fuel vehicles penetrate the
            market. Production levels for alternative-fuel vehicles are constrained by the lead time
            to switch production to a particular technology and the availability of technologies in
            each size class. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Depending on per capita
            income, fuel prices, and fuel economy, consumers may switch to either smaller size classes
            or smaller vehicles with lower horsepower requirements within a size class. The trend in
            vehicle sales toward or away from light trucks (vans, sport utility vehicles, and pickups)
            is determined by fuel prices. Vehicle travel is determined by the cost of driving per mile
            and per capita income. For flex-fuel or bi-fuel alternative-fuel vehicles, the percentage
            use of each fuel is based on the price differential between gasoline and the alternative
            fuel. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Responding to changes in fuel
            prices, gasoline has a 2-year demand elasticity of -0.25 and a 20-year elasticity of
            -0.45. In the long term, consumers are expected to alter their purchasing patterns and
            manufacturers to incorporate more fuel-saving technologies. Because fuel use for freight
            trucks and trains depends primarily on requirements for freight movement as a result of
            economic activity and the slow turnover of the stock, distillate fuel has lower 2-year and
            20-year price elasticities, at -0.09 and -0.13, respectively. In addition to fuel prices,
            business and personal air travel also depend on gross domestic product (GDP) and per
            capita income, respectively, and have very slow rates of stock turnover. Jet fuel has
            2-year and 20-year elasticities of -0.12 and -0.15. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Energy intensity in the
            transportation sector is defined as energy use (in terms of gallons of gasoline) per
            vehicle per year. In the reference case, transportation energy intensity in 2010 is
            projected to be about 635 gallons of gasoline per vehicle, or about 53 gallons per month (<a href="pdf/c3graph7.pdf">Figure 53</a>). Energy intensity in the 1990+24% case is lower
            than in the reference case but only by 12 gallons of gasoline per car per month. In the
            1990+9% case, the projected energy intensity in 2010 is almost 53 gallons
            lower&#151;equivalent to 1 month&#146;s use of gasoline. In the&nbsp;1990-3% and 1990-7%
            cases, the corresponding reductions in gasoline consumption in 2010 are equivalent to
            nearly 1.5 and 2 months of gasoline use, respectively. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the absence of fuel price
            changes, transportation energy intensity will change in response to stock turnover,
            technology availability, and income effects (<a href="tbl10.html">Table 10).</a> Because
            1998 prices are lower than those projected for 2010 in the reference case, vehicle-miles
            traveled would be higher and fuel efficiency lower than in the reference case if the 1998
            price level continued. Constant 1998 fuel prices would slightly increase air travel, but
            aircraft efficiency levels would not decline relative to those in the reference case. More
            air travel would necessitate higher aircraft stock levels in 2010, but the increase would
            be more than offset by higher levels of travel per plane. Freight truck fuel intensity
            would not change with constant prices, because freight travel is determined primarily by
            economic activity rather than fuel prices. The slightly lower fuel prices in the constant
            price case would not be enough to lower the fuel economy of freight trucks relative to
            their projected fuel economy in the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Carbon Reduction Cases</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The transportation sector is
            the only sector that does not reach 1990 carbon emissions levels by 2010 in any of the
            carbon reduction cases <a href="pdf/c3graph7.pdf">(Figure 54</a>). In the reference case,
            energy demand in the transportation sector is projected to exceed 1990 levels by
            approximately 10.7 quadrillion Btu in 2010, a 49-percent increase (<a href="pdf/c3graph8.pdf">Figure 55</a>). The corresponding increases are 9.4 quadrillion
            Btu in the 1990+24% case, 8.6 quadrillion Btu in the 1990+9% case, and 6.6 quadrillion Btu
            in the 1990-3% case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Relative to the reference
            case, only 14 percent of the projected reduction in total energy demand for all sectors in

            case, and 24 percent in the 1990-3% case. In the 1990-3% case, the reduction in carbon
            emissions from all sectors in 2010 is approximately 492 million metric tons, of which 18
            percent comes from the transportation sector. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><b>Light-Duty Vehicles</b></i> </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Travel Demand</b>.
            Light-duty vehicle travel (cars, pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles) in 2010
            is projected to be 1.3 percent lower than in the reference case in the 1990+24% case, 5.2
            percent lower in the 1990+9% case, and 11.2 percent lower in the 1990-3% case (<a href="pdf/c3graph8.pdf">Figure 56</a>). Declines in light-duty vehicle travel have been
            seen historically in 1973-1974 (2.7 percent) and 1979-1980 (1.6 percent). In the 1990+24%
            and 1990+9% cases, the levels of light-duty vehicle travel rise between 2005 and 2008,
            they are projected to decline by an average of 1.2 percent per year over the same period
            in the 1990-3% case (comparable to the rate of decline from 1979 to 1980). In 1973-1974
            and 1979-1980, disposable per capita income was declining, at 0.7-percent and 0.3-percent
            annual rates, respectively. Those historical declines in income per capita, combined with
            rising fuel prices, further reduced vehicle travel. In contrast, from 2005 to 2008 income
            per capita is projected to rise at an average annual rate of 0.8 percent, more than twice
            the projected rate in the reference case, partially offsetting the reductions in travel
            that are expected to accompany higher fuel prices. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Slowing growth in
            vehicle-miles traveled is projected even in the reference case, for several reasons.
            First, as the &#147;baby boomers&#148; age, they are expected to drive less (although they
            probably will drive more than previous generations of the same age group).<a href="fnote1.html#49"><sup>49</sup></a> Second, as more women have entered the workforce
            over the past three decades, resulting in more two-income households, female drivers have
            logged more vehicle-miles of travel; however, that growth will eventually slow as the
            vehicle-miles traveled by women approaches that of men. Finally, consumers have been
            keeping their vehicles longer than in past decades, and older cars tend to be driven less
            than newer cars. A countervailing trend is the recent growth in purchases of light trucks,
            which are driven 4.7 percent more per year than cars. In the carbon reduction cases, a
            reversal of this trend back to car sales as a result of higher fuel prices is expected,
            leading to slower growth in vehicle-miles traveled. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After 2010, vehicle-miles of
            travel, total fuel use, and total carbon emissions for light-duty vehicles are projected
            to begin rising again in the 1990-3% case and to continue on an upward path through 2020,
            paralleling the trends in the reference, 1990+24%, and 1990+9% cases for the later years
            of the forecast. There are three reasons for the continued growth in vehicle-miles
            traveled after 2012. First, carbon prices are projected to decline in most cases after
            2010. Second, lower demand for gasoline is projected to result in lower refining costs,
            lower world oil prices, and lower gasoline prices. Finally, increases in disposable income
            after 2012&#151;particularly after 2015, when the U.S. average disposable income in the
            1990+24%, 1990+9%, and 1990-3% cases is expected to exceed that projected in the reference
            case as the economy rebounds from the initial response to carbon reduction
            efforts&#151;lead to more rapid increases in light-duty vehicle travel from 2012 through
            2020. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Increased telecommuting, which
            is assumed to reduce vehicle-miles traveled by 0.13 percent in 2000 according to the
            Climate Change Action Plan,<a href="fnote1.html#50"><sup>50</sup></a> is also assumed in
            all the cases for this analysis, resulting in fuel savings of 21.6 trillion Btu in 2000.
            The 0.13-percent reduction is assumed to continue throughout the projections, so that as
            vehicle-miles traveled increase over time, the savings from telecommuting increase
            proportionately. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Fuel Efficiency</b>. In the
            carbon reduction cases, the fuel economy of newly purchased light-duty vehicles in 2010 is
            expected to be higher than projected in the reference case. Higher fuel prices are
            expected to encourage the development of advanced fuel-saving technologies, as well as
            changes in consumer purchasing patterns. For example, average fuel efficiency for all new
            light-duty vehicles in 2010, projected to be just under 25 miles per gallon in the
            reference case, surpasses 27 miles per gallon in the 1990+9% case (<a href="pdf/c3graph8.pdf">Figure 57</a>), and even higher levels might be achieved with more
            rapid advances in technology, as described in the discussion of sensitivity cases below.
            The projections of new vehicle fuel efficiency in the reference, 1990+24%, 1990+9%, and
            1990-3% cases in 2010 are as follows: for cars, 30.6, 32.0, 33.6, and 35.6 miles per
            gallon; and for light trucks, 20.4, 21.2, 22.1, and 23.3 miles per gallon. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the past, a 4.3-percent
            average annual increase in new car fuel efficiency was achieved by automobile
            manufacturers from 1976 to 1988. Thus, the projected increases of 0.9 percent per year
            from 1996 to 2010 in the 1990+24% case, 1.3 percent per year in the 1990+9% case, and 1.7
            percent per year in the 1990-3% case appear to be possible. On the other hand, those
            historical improvement rates resulted from the introduction of fuel-saving technologies
            that involved radical changes in structural design and were relatively inexpensive to
            implement. For example, space and size reductions resulting from downsizing to front wheel
            drive designs actually reduced costs while also permitting the spatial redesign of engine
            compartments, but further downsizing and weight reductions may be difficult to achieve,
            because they could eliminate larger vehicles from the marketplace and, possibly, increase
            the safety concerns associated with smaller light-weight vehicles. Diminishing returns to
            scale have limited the potential for future fuel savings, because many of the least
            expensive options have already been implemented. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Light trucks have not achieved
            fuel efficiency improvements equivalent to those for automobiles, because consumers have
            sought higher horsepower for personal use (particularly in sport utility vehicles),
            hauling (pickup trucks), and commercial applications (standard vans). Historically, the
            highest average annual growth rate in fuel efficiency for new light trucks was 2.9 percent
            per year from 1976 to 1986. In contrast, light truck fuel economy is projected to grow by
            only 0.1 percent annually in the 1990+24% case, 0.4 percent annually in the 1990+9% case
            and 0.8 percent annually in the 1990-3% case between 2000 and 2010. Lower growth rates
            occur for light trucks in the carbon reduction cases than historically because of the
            difference described above regarding inexpensive and one time technological improvements. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Among the 55 fuel-saving
            technologies that are assumed to be available to manufacturers of light-duty vehicles in
            the reference and carbon reduction cases, the most significant market penetration is
            expected for drag reduction, continuously variable transmissions, electronic transmission
            controls, cylinder friction reduction technologies, advances in low-rolling-resistance
            tires, variable valve timing, and accessory control units (<a href="tbl11.html">Table 11</a>).
            Aerodynamic improvements (drag reduction) have already been implemented on many vehicles,
            but further market penetration may be possible, especially in the larger size classes.
            Continuously variable transmissions match the gear ratio in a continuous manner over the
            wide spectrum of gear ratios demanded by the engine, rather than having a discrete number
            
            of gears. Electronic transmission controls assist the transmission by matching more
            precisely the gear to be used with a given engine load. Cylinder friction reduction
            technologies, such as low-friction pistons and rings, lower the thermal and mechanical
            losses of the engine. Low-rolling-resistance tires limit energy losses from friction
            between tires and road surfaces. Variable valve timing improves the thermal efficiency of
            an engine by precisely timing when the ignition sparks within the cylinder. Electronic
            controls and electric motors for accessory drives on vehicles (cooling fan, water pump,
            alternator, power steering and windows) could improve fuel economy by reducing engine
            loads. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Changes in consumer purchasing
            patterns also are expected to contribute to the fuel economy improvements for light-duty
            vehicles in the carbon reduction cases. For that to happen, however, trends in consumer
            choices over the past decade would have to be reversed. With low fuel prices and high
            disposable income per capita, average fuel economy has been flat from 1990 to 1996.
            Consumer purchases have tended toward larger cars and light trucks, especially sport
            utility vehicles, and there has been a growing preference for light trucks over cars.
            Similarly, within each size class, consumers have tended to purchase cars and light trucks
            that are larger and have more horsepower. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1996, compact cars
            accounted for 45 percent of new automobile sales, an increase from 34 percent in 1990;
            however, the subcompact share of new car sales fell from a high of 26 percent in 1991 to
            19 percent in 1996. Small pickup trucks, which captured 25 percent of the market for new
            light trucks in 1990, reached a low of 19 percent in 1996. Concurrently, standard and
            compact sport utility vehicles, which had only a 20-percent share of the light truck
            market in 1990, had a 45-percent share in 1996. The average fuel economy of small pickup
            trucks is 26.3 miles per gallon, as compared with 21.3 miles per gallon for small utility
            trucks and 18.1 miles per gallon for large sport utility vehicles, which are now growing
            in share at a much faster pace than even small utility trucks. Sales of large sport
            utility vehicles increased from 3.3 percent of all new light truck sales in 1991 to a high
            of 10.3 percent in 1996. In addition, sales of small vans, which currently have an average
            fuel economy rating of about 22.7 miles per gallon, are being displaced by sales of small
            and large sport utility vehicles. With a large supply of sport utility vehicles available
            to consumers and a lack of station wagons designed from sedan autos, which have a much
            higher fuel efficiency rating, the fuel economy options for new vehicle buyers are
            becoming limited. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With higher fuel prices in the
            carbon reduction cases in 2010 than in the reference case, it is projected that size class
            shares will return to near 1976 levels. The subcompact share of new car sales in 2010 is
            projected to be 15 percent in the 1990+24% case, 19 percent in the 1990+9% case, and 24
            percent in the 1990-3% case, compared with 12 percent in the reference case (<a href="pdf/c3graph8.pdf">Figure 58</a>). Similar trends are projected for all size classes
            in the carbon reduction cases, as consumers move their vehicle purchases down to lower
            size classes and sales of compact, mid-size, and large cars are reduced. Although shifting
            vehicle lines back to production of smaller cars would require major changes in production
            facilities, the lead time associated with those changes has narrowed from about 4 years to
            2 years. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Since 1990, the growth in
            light trucks sales at the expense of car sales, and the growth in sales of standard and
            compact sport utility vehicles and minivans at the expense of station wagons has slowed
            the rate of improvement in efficiency for new light-duty vehicles. Light truck sales
            shares have grown from about 37 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in 1990 to 43
            percent in 1997, with a net loss on average of more than 8 miles per gallon between new
            cars and light trucks. In 2010, light trucks sales are projected to be 46.1 percent of
            light-duty vehicle sales in the 1990+24% case, 44.4 percent in the 1990+9% case, and 42.5
            percent in the 1990-3% case, compared with 47 percent in the reference case. Reversing the
            
            trend back toward cars and away from truck purchases will not be costless, however.
            Vehicle manufacturers reap much higher profits from sales of light trucks than from car
            sales. In addition, consumers may have difficulty finding fuel-efficient vehicles suitable
            for larger families with the disappearance of many station wagons from the new car market. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Horsepower</strong><b>.</b> Growth rates in new vehicle horsepower in the light-duty vehicle market are currently at
            their highest historical levels. From 1990 to 1997, new vehicle horsepower increased at
            annual rates of 3.2 percent for cars and 4.3 percent for light trucks. Between 1996 and
            2010, horsepower for both cars and light trucks is projected to increase at an annual rate
            of 2.4 percent in the reference case, as a result of high per capita incomes and low fuel
            prices. The higher fuel prices in the carbon reduction cases are projected to lower the
            growth rate of horsepower for cars to 1.9 percent between 1996 to 2010 in the 1990+24%
            case, 1.2 percent in the 1990+9% case, and 0.3 percent in the 1990-3% case (<a href="pdf/c3graph9.pdf">Figure 59</a>). <br />
            <br />
            <b>Fuel Consumption.</b> Reductions in fuel use by light-duty vehicles (cars, pickup
            trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles) are projected to account for more than
            two-thirds of the reduction in transportation energy consumption in 2010 in the carbon
            reduction cases relative to the reference case projections. In the reference case,
            light-duty vehicles are responsible for 57 percent of all transportation use in 2010 (<a href="pdf/c3graph9.pdf">Figure 60)</a>. The difference in gasoline consumption by
            light-duty vehicles (<a href="pdf/c3graph9.pdf">Figure 61</a>) results from both a decline
            in vehicle-miles traveled and an increase in new car and light truck efficiency in
            response to higher gasoline prices and lower levels of disposable income. As fuel-saving
            technologies penetrate the light-duty vehicle market, higher fuel efficiencies lower the
            cost of driving per mile, which increases vehicle travel, offsetting some of the fuel
            savings.<a href="fnote1.html#51"><sup>51</sup></a> The increase in fuel efficiency also
            reduced the demand for gasoline, leading to lower gasoline prices than would otherwise
            have occurred. Gasoline prices in real 1996 dollars in 2010 are projected to be 14 cents
            per gallon higher in the 1990+24% case than in the reference case, 30 cents per gallon
            higher in the 1990+9% case, and 55 cents per gallon higher in the 1990-3% case. Comparable
            increases in gasoline prices were last seen during the oil crisis of 1973-1974 (33 cents a
            gallon in 1996 dollars) and during the oil embargo of 1979-1980 (47 cents a gallon). </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Personal, business, and
            international air travel are expected to decline in response to higher jet fuel prices and

            from 2005 through 2015. The projected levels of air travel in 2010 are 1.4 percent lower
            in the 1990+24% case than in the reference case, 7.4 percent lower in the 1990+9% case,
            and 16.0 percent lower in the 1990-3% case. Higher fuel prices in 2010 are projected to
            increase ticket prices by 5 percent, 13 percent, and 23 percent in the 1990+24% case,
            1990+9% and 1990-3% cases, respectively, over the reference case prices. Lower merchandise

            dedicated air freight travel. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Between 2005 and 2008, air
            travel is projected to decline by 1.2 percent annually in the 1990-3% case as a result of
            a 19-percent average annual increase in jet fuel prices. In comparison, air travel
            declined by 2.2 percent from 1980 to 1981, when jet fuel prices increase by 49 percent.
            Similar to light-duty vehicles, differences in the responses to higher fuel prices between
            history and the carbon reduction cases can be explained by comparing growth rates in
            income levels. Income during 2005 to 2008 is expected to increase by 0.8 percent annually
            in the carbon reduction cases, however from 1980 to 1981 income was rising even faster at
            2.3 percent per year, which mitigated the decline in air travel. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Only relatively minor changes
            in the average fuel efficiency of new aircraft are expected to result from the imposition
            of carbon reduction targets. For example, in the 1990+9% case, new aircraft fuel
            efficiency is projected to improve at an annual rate of just 0.9 percent between 1996 and
            2010, compared with the 0.7-percent rate projected in the reference case. As a result, the
            average efficiencies projected for the entire U.S. stock of aircraft are nearly the same
            in the two cases (<a href="pdf/c3graph9.pdf">Figure 62). </a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Less air travel is expected in
            the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, leading to slower rates of aircraft
            stock turnover, which in turn limit the penetration of new aircraft into the aircraft
            stock. Higher fuel prices and lower air travel in the carbon reduction cases lower the
            demand for wide-body aircraft, which have higher efficiencies in terms of seat-miles per
            gallon than do narrow-body aircraft. In addition, near-term aircraft technologies that can
            improve fuel efficiency are limited, and they are not expected to be cost-effective even
            in the 1990-3% case. Among the six advanced aircraft technologies available by 2010, only
            weight-reducing materials and ultra-high-bypass engines, which are currently in use, are
            expected to penetrate the market (<a href="tbl12.html">Table 12</a>); and only the
            ultra-high-bypass engine technology is projected to achieve significant penetration (more
            than 90 percent) by 2010, and then only in the 1990-3% case or the high technology
            sensitivity case described below. </font></p>

            and Shipping</b></i></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The projected demand for
            distillate fuel, used primarily for freight trucks and rail, is also lower in the carbon
            reduction cases than in the reference case in 2010&#151;by 2 percent in the 1990+24% case,
            by 4.9 percent in the 1990+9% case, and by 8.3 percent in the 1990-3% case (see Figure
            61). Distillate fuel prices are projected to be 15 cents per gallon higher in the 1990+24%
            case, 37 cents per gallon higher in the 1990+9% case and 68 cents higher in the 1990-3%
            case. These increases are larger than those projected for gasoline because of the higher
            carbon content of distillate fuel. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Higher fuel prices do not
            result in as much change in travel and efficiency for freight trucks and rail as they do
            for light-duty vehicles. Because of the slow turnover in the stock of freight trucks and
            rail and the high power requirements of the engines used to move freight, fuel savings are
            limited. The main source of reductions in distillate fuel use is the response to overall
            lower economic activity and demand for goods by 2010 in the carbon reduction cases,
            leading to lower freight travel for both trucks and rail. Lower demand for goods in the
            1990+24%, 1990+9% and 1990-3% cases results in levels of freight truck travel that are 1.3
            percent, 2.4 percent and 4.9 percent lower, respectively, in 2010 than projected in the
            reference case. Declines in coal consumption and production also lead to further cuts in
            rail travel as described below. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The potential for improvement
            in fuel economy for freight trucks is also limited. In the reference case, the fuel
            efficiency of new freight trucks is projected to increase by only 0.6 percent per year
            between 1996 and 2010. Even with higher distillate fuel prices in the 1990-3% case, the
            efficiency for new freight trucks improves at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent. As a
            result of the lower demand for goods and slower turnover in the stock of freight trucks
            projected in the 1990+9% case relative to the reference case, there is almost no
            difference in the projected average stock efficiencies for the two cases in 2010 (<a href="pdf/c3graph9.pdf">Figure 63</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The number of advanced
            technologies available for freight trucks is relatively small. Those with the greatest
            potential are advanced aerodynamics, the turbo-compound diesel engine, and the LE-55 heat
            engine, with expected marginal fuel efficiency improvements of approximately 25, 10, and
            17 percent, respectively (<a href="tbl13.html">Table 13</a>). In all the carbon reduction
            cases, the advanced aerodynamics technology is projected to achieve the greatest
            efficiency improvements and highest penetration rates for both medium- and heavy-duty
            trucks. The turbo-compound diesel engine and the LE-55 heat engine do not penetrate the
            market until after 2010, except in the high technology sensitivity cases. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In percentage terms, the
            projections for rail and ship freight travel in 2010 show the sharpest reductions relative
            to the reference case in the carbon reduction cases. Rail freight travel is 9 percent, 23
            percent, and 32 percent lower in 2010 in the 1990+24%, 1990+9%, and 1990-3% cases than in
            the reference case. Since more than 40 percent of rail travel is for coal transportation,
            the lower rail travel in the carbon reduction cases is primarily due to the projected
            reductions in coal production of 20 percent, 52 percent, and 71 percent in the 1990+24%,
            1990+9%, and 1990-3% cases relative to the reference case. Domestic freight travel by ship
            is projected to be 3 percent, 6 percent, and 10 percent lower in the three cases than in
            the reference case. Domestic shipping is not expected to be affected as adversely by the
            decline in coal production as is rail traffic; however, with lower demand for goods and
            industrial production in the carbon reduction cases, domestic shipping is also projected
            to be lower. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Like freight truck and rail
            travel, shipping is affected more by the impacts of carbon prices on travel and shipping
            requirements than by the direct impacts of higher fuel costs. High-carbon residual fuel
            has the largest projected price increases of all the transportation fuels, with increments
            of 19 cents per gallon in the 1990+24% case, 46 cents in the 1990+9% case, and 84
            cents&#151;almost 100 percent&#151;in the 1990-3% case relative to the prices projected
            for 2010 in the reference case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Approximately 15 to 17 percent
            of the drop in total fuel consumption in 2010 in the carbon reduction cases is attributed
            to aircraft, 6 to 7 percent to freight trucks, 4 to 6 percent to rail engines, and 1
            percent to marine engines. The relative energy consumption shares for the major
            transportation modes and fuels do not vary significantly across the cases (<a href="tbl14.html">Table 14</a>). </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Both freight rail and domestic
            shipping efficiencies are projected to remain at reference case levels in the carbon
            reduction cases. Stock turnover will virtually cease, because rail ton-miles traveled are
            lower by 32 percent in 2010 in the 1990-3% case than in the reference case, and domestic
            shipping travel is 10 percent lower. Also, with the loss in revenue associated with the
            projected lower levels of travel, efficiency improvements will be difficult to achieve. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Alternative-Fuel Vehicles</b> </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">According to consumer surveys,
            alternative-fuel vehicle sales are dependent on vehicle price, the cost of driving per
            mile, vehicle range, fuel availability, and commercial availability. In 2010,
            alternative-fuel vehicle sales as a percent of light-duty vehicle sales are projected to
            increase to 11.98 percent in the 1990+24% case, 12.07 percent in the 1990+9% case, and
            12.10 percent in the 1990-3% case from 11.91 percent in the reference case. The projected
            market shares for alternative-fuel vehicles are higher in the carbon reduction cases
            primarily because higher fuel prices would encourage consumers to take advantage of the
            higher fuel efficiencies and lower costs of driving projected for some alternative-fuel
            vehicles relative to gasoline vehicles. In addition, as the fuel efficiency of
            alternative-fuel vehicles improves, their driving range will increase. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Although alternative-fuel
            vehicle sales increase in percentage terms relative to the reference case in 2010, the
            actual number of alternative-fuel vehicles sold is expected to be smaller in the carbon
            reduction cases as a result of projected declines in light-duty vehicle sales overall. In
            the reference case alternative-fuel vehicle sales are projected to be approximately 1.79
            million vehicles in 2010, whereas sales range between 1.68 and 1.75 million vehicles in
            the 1990+24%, 1990+9%, 1990+9% , and 1990-3% cases. Similar results are projected for
            alternative-fuel consumption as a percentage of total transportation fuel use in 2010.
            Although the projected cost of driving per mile is lower for some alternative-fuel
            vehicles than for gasoline vehicles in some of the carbon reduction cases, it would still
            be more costly to drive an alternative-fuel vehicle than a gasoline vehicle. The purchase
            prices for most alternative-fuel vehicles still would be higher than those for
            conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, and additional driving costs would be incurred as
            the result of lower vehicle range and limited availability of fuel. Also, with higher
            projected fuel prices, vehicle-miles traveled are expected to be reduced for all vehicles,
            including those that use alternative fuels. Finally, the higher efficiencies of
            alternative-fuel vehicles would lower their total fuel consumption. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Sensitivity Cases</b></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To examine the effects of
            technology improvements on energy use and prices, two sensitivity cases were analyzed for
            the transportation sector. The 1990+9% low technology sensitivity case was designed to
            hold average new vehicle fuel efficiencies at their 1998 levels throughout the forecast
            period. The implication is that stock turnover and travel reductions would have to
            compensate for the lack of fuel efficiency improvements in order to meet the carbon
            reduction targets. The 1990+9% high technology sensitivity case was designed to illustrate
            the effects of advanced fuel-saving technologies on transportation fuel efficiency, fuel
            consumption, and carbon emissions. This sensitivity case generally assumes that the costs
            of new technologies will be reduced, the marginal fuel efficiency benefits will be higher,
            and the advanced technologies will be commercially available at earlier dates than in the
            reference case or the carbon reduction cases.<a href="fnote1.html#52"><sup>52</sup></a> higher, and the advanced technologies will be commercially available at earlier dates than
            in the reference case or the carbon reduction cases.<a href="fnote1.html#52"><sup>52</sup> </a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Higher projected carbon prices
            
            in the low technology sensitivity case lead to higher prices for all transportation fuels.
            In 2010, average fuel prices in the transportation sector are projected to be 14 percent
            higher in the 1990+9% low technology case than in the 1990+9% case. Gasoline prices are
            projected to be about 19 cents per gallon higher, jet fuel prices 21 cents per gallon
            higher, distillate fuel prices 22 cents per gallon higher, and residual fuel prices 26
            cents per gallon higher. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Both fuel efficiency and
            travel are lower in the low technology case than in the 1990+9% case. Higher fuel prices
            would affect travel both directly and through their secondary impacts on the general
            levels of macroeconomic activity, disposable income, and freight movement. Of all travel
            modes, vehicle-miles traveled by light-duty vehicles are the most responsive to the higher
            fuel prices in the 1990+9% low technology case, with a 5.1-percent reduction from the
            projected level in the 1990+9% case in 2010. Air travel is reduced by a similar
            percentage, 5.5 percent, whereas smaller reductions are projected for freight, rail, and
            domestic shipping travel (0.8 percent, 3.1 percent, and 0.9 percent, respectively). Total
            projected fuel consumption in 2010 is higher in the low technology case than in the
            1990+9% case, because fuel efficiency does not improve as rapidly. </font></p>

                  transportation sector is whether the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the United
                  States will lead to increased use of mass transit and carpooling. Automobile
                  transportation is a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse emissions, and a
                  cutback in this area would be desirable. U.S. transportation patterns make this unlikely,
                  however, in spite of the fact that the carbon reduction cases in this analysis project
                  higher gasoline prices and lower levels of vehicle-miles traveled. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The United States consumes far
                  more energy per capita for transportation than any other developed country, with U.S.
                  passenger travel dominated by the automobile. In 1990, about 86 percent of passenger-miles
                  were accounted for by automobiles, and mass transit accounted for less than 4 percent. The
                  U.S. mass transit system includes buses, light rail, commuter rail, trolleys, subways, and
                  an array of services such as van pools, subsidized taxis, dial-a-ride services, and shared
                  minibus and van rides. Most cities of over 20,000 population have bus systems, and buses
                  on established routes with set schedules account for over half of all public transit
                  passenger trips. About 70 percent of all public transit trips in 1990, however, were in
                  the 10 cities with rapid rail systems; 41 percent were in New York City and its suburbs.<sup>a</sup> More recent statistics show that, as of 1995, mass transit accounted for only 0.8 percent
                  of total fuel consumption in the transportation sector.<sup>b</sup></font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">One reason for the low usage
                  of mass transit in the United States and the concentration of use in major cities is urban
                  development that has decreased the importance of historic central business districts
                  (CBDs). Peak trips in general, and work trips in particular, have become diffuse in both
                  origin and destination and thus not easily served by mass transit. In 1980 only 9 percent
                  of the workers in urban areas and only 3 percent of workers living outside the central
                  city were employed in the CBDs.<sup>c</sup> (In Europe, where population densities are
                  much higher, access to the workplace is much easier.) Other factors that work against mass
                  transit in the United States are a past history of low gasoline prices, rising income
                  levels, increasing numbers of women in the workforce with needs to drop off and pick up
                  children at child care facilities, a move toward less standardization of work hours, and
                  premiums placed on personal independence and time saved by driving rather than making use
                  of mass transit. The same factors affect the use of carpooling. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Available statistics support
                  the contention that the lower levels of vehicle-miles traveled associated with the carbon
                  reduction cases do not necessarily imply increased use of mass transit. According to the
                  American Public Transit Association, all forms of mass transit in terms of passenger-miles
                  decline during periods of high fuel prices.<sup>d</sup> Transit rail passenger-miles,
                  which include light and heavy rail travel, declined by nearly 10 percent from 1973 to 1974
                  and by 5 percent from 1979 to 1981, even though real gasoline prices concurrently rose by
                  28 percent during both periods. Similar trends occurred in commuter rail, which
                  experienced declines of almost 8 percent from 1980 to 1982. Between 1979 and 1982, transit
                  bus passenger-miles declined by 7 percent and intercity bus travel by 1 percent, while
                  real gasoline prices increased by 15 percent. A counter example is the period from 1973 to
                  1974, when transit bus use rose by 11 percent, and intercity bus passenger-miles increased
                  by 5 percent. That period was unique, however, because gasoline was often either
                  unavailable or required waits of up to several hours in gas station lines. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Carpooling trends, according
                  to the U.S. Census Bureau, have declined from approximately 20 percent of the workforce in
                  1980 to just over 13 percent in 1990.<sup>e</sup> The National Personal Transportation
                  Survey has reported similar trends in vehicle occupancy rates, which indicate that from
                  1977 through 1990, vehicle occupancy rates have declined in commuting to and from work,
                  from 1.30 to 1.14 person-miles per vehicle mile.<sup>f</sup> These occupancy rates
                  correspond to about one-third of total vehicle-miles traveled. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Because travelers do not take
                  into account such externalities as reducing greenhouse gas emissions when making their
                  transportation decisions, and past gasoline price increases do not seem to have had an
                  impact, it is unlikely that mass transit and carpooling will increase in the United States
                  without policy intervention factors such as higher gasoline taxes and urban and
                  transportation planning that facilitates access to workplaces. There are differing
                  opinions as to the role these factors could play in shaping travel patterns. If history,
                  geography, income, and demographics are the primary determinants of travel patterns,
                  policy may play only a minor role in changing energy use; but if instruments of public
                  policy are primary travel determinants, then there is a large potential for policy to
                  reduce energy use<sup>g</sup> and alter mass transit and carpooling patterns. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With lower carbon prices and
            lower fuel prices in the 1990+9% high technology sensitivity case, more travel is expected
            than in the 1990+9% case. Despite the higher travel projection, however, more rapid
            improvements in new vehicle and stock fuel efficiencies result in lower fuel consumption
            in the high technology case, with higher fuel efficiencies outweighing the projected
            increases in vehicle-miles traveled that result from lower projected fuel prices. Average
            transportation fuel prices in 2010 are 9.6 percent lower in the 1990+9% high technology
            sensitivity case than in the 1990+9% case. Gasoline prices are projected to be 14 cents
            per gallon lower in 2010, jet fuel prices 13 cents per gallon lower, distillate fuel
            prices 14 cents per gallon lower, and residual fuel prices 16 cents per gallon lower. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Comparing across the travel
            modes, light-duty vehicles hold the greatest potential for reducing fuel consumption and
            carbon emissions with more rapid technology advances (<a href="pdf/c3graph9.pdf">Figure 64</a>).
            Not only do light-duty vehicles consume more fuel in total than the other vehicle types
            (more than 56 percent of all transportation fuel use in 1996), they also have the greatest
            potential for advanced technology penetration. In the 1990+9% high technology sensitivity
            case, light-duty vehicles are projected to account for 65 percent of the reduction in
            transportation fuel use relative to the 1990+9% case, compared with 20 percent for trucks,
            11 percent for aircraft, 4 percent for rail, and 1 percent for marine. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Fuel-saving technologies for
            conventional light-duty vehicles in the high technology case are assumed to have
            approximately 50 percent lower marginal technology costs and 30 percent higher marginal
            fuel efficiency improvements than those for gasoline vehicles. All conventional
            technologies achieve lower sales penetration rates in the high technology case than in the
            1990+9% case, due to lower fuel prices (Table 11); however, because the marginal fuel
            efficiencies are also higher than in the 1990+9% case, the total fuel efficiency
            improvement is larger in the high technology case. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With lower marginal costs and
            earlier introduction dates in the high technology sensitivity, most new aircraft
            technologies reach significantly higher penetration rates than in the 1990+9% case with
            reference technology (Table 12). The penetration rate for ultra-high-bypass engines is
            lower in the high technology case, because they are partially displaced by advanced
            thermodynamic engines. Substantial fuel efficiency improvements result from the
            penetration of weight-reducing materials, advanced aerodynamics, and advanced
            thermodynamic engines, which can potentially achieve efficiency improvements of 15
            percent, 18 percent, and 20 percent, respectively. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Fuel efficiency for new
            freight trucks rises by more than 1 mile per gallon by 2010 in the high technology case
            relative to the 1990+9% case, primarily because of the penetration of the turbo compound
            diesel, LE-55 heat engine, improved tires and lubricants, and electronic engine controls
            on heavy-duty trucks (Table 13). Both advanced engine technologies&#151;the turbo compound
            diesel and LE-55 heat engine&#151;are diesel technologies, which improve fuel economy by
            10 percent and 23 percent, respectively. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The high technology case
            assumes that the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Transportation Technologies program
            goals<a href="fnote1.html#53"><sup>53</sup></a> for alternative-fuel vehicle cost and
            performance improvements will be met. Generally these program goals include a reduction of
            50 to 66 percent in the marginal price difference between comparable gasoline vehicles and
            electric or electric hybrid vehicles, and a 75-percent reduction in the difference for
            fuel cell vehicles. Fuel efficiency improvements are assumed to be 230 to 300 percent
            greater for electric and electric hybrid vehicles and 250 percent greater for fuel cell
            vehicles than for gasoline vehicles. These fuel efficiency improvements are also assumed
            to result in travel ranges that are 57 percent greater for electric hybrid vehicles and 20
            percent greater for fuel cell vehicles than the range for similar sized gasoline vehicles.
            Total alternative-fuel vehicle sales in the 1990+9% high technology case in 2010 are
            projected to make up almost 19 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales, compared with just
            over 11 percent in both the reference and 1990+9% cases. The projected shares for
            
            different alternative-fuel vehicle types are shown in <a href="tbl15.html">Table 15</a>. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In order for alternative-fuel
            vehicles to displace large quantities of gasoline use, they must penetrate the market
            early enough to replace gasoline vehicles and then sustain high sales volumes.
            Displacement of gasoline may be limited, however, because the vast majority of the
            projected increase in alternative-fuel vehicle sales consists of alcohol flexible-fuel
            vehicles, which are expected to have only slightly higher fuel efficiencies than gasoline
            vehicles. They will also use only 15-percent blends of E85 and M85 and will more
            frequently be consuming gasoline than the alternative fuel. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For alternative-fuel vehicles
            to maintain a larger share of the vehicle market, they will need to have lower costs,
            higher performance, and earlier availability dates than projected in this analysis.
            Simultaneously, higher fuel prices will be needed to send market signals to both consumers
            and vehicle producers. The high technology case indicates both of these points:
            fuel-saving technology becomes available and is purchased in 2005, but its advantage is
            quickly offset by reductions in gasoline consumption, which lead to lower gasoline prices.
            Consequently, as fuel prices begin to decline after 2008, consumers tend to demand higher
            performance and larger vehicles, and manufacturers respond by designing and producing
          larger, more profitable models, such as sport utility vehicles.</font></p></td>
