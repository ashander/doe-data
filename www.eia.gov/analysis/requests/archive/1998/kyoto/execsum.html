<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="The analysis in this report was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Science of the U.S. House of Representatives. In its request, the Committee asked the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to analyze the Kyoto Protocol, “focusing on U.S. energy use and prices and the economy in the 2008-2012 time frame,” as noted in the first letter in Appendix D. The Committee specified that EIA consider several cases for energy-related carbon reductions in its analysis, with sensitivities evaluating some key uncertainties: U.S. economic growth, the cost and performance of energy-using technologies, and the possible construction of new nuclear power plants.">

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Over the past several decades,
            
            rising concentrations of greenhouse gases have been detected in the Earth&#146;s
            
            atmosphere. It has been hypothesized that the continued accumulation of greenhouse gases
            
            could lead to an increase in the average temperature of the Earth&#146;s surface and cause
            
            a variety of changes in the global climate, sea level, agricultural patterns, and
            
            ecosystems that could be, on net, detrimental. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The Intergovernmental Panel on
            
            Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the World Meteorological Organization and the
            
            United Nations Environment Programme in 1988 to assess the available scientific,
            
            technical, and socioeconomic information in the field of climate change. The most recent
            
            report of the IPCC concluded that: &#147;Our ability to quantify the human influence on
            
            global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the
            
            noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties in key factors. These
            
            include the magnitudes and patterns of long-term variability and the time-evolving pattern
            
            of forcing by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases and
            
            aerosols, and land surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that
            
            there is a discernable human influence on global climate.&#148;<a href="fnote.html#1"><sup>1</sup> </a></font></p>

            Convention on Climate Change was adopted at the United Nations on May 9, 1992, and opened
            
            for signature at Rio de Janeiro on June 4. The objective of the Framework Convention was
            
            to &#147;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;achieve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;stabilization of the greenhouse
            
            gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic
            
            interference with the climate system.&#148; The signatories agreed to formulate programs
            
            to mitigate climate change, and the developed country signatories agreed to&nbsp;adopt
            
            national policies to return anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990
            
            levels. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The first and second
            
            Conference of the Parties in 1995 and 1996 agreed to address the issue of greenhouse gas
            
            emissions for the period beyond 2000, and to negotiate quantified emission limitations and
            
            reductions for the third Conference of the Parties. On December 1 through 11, 1997,
            
            representatives from more than 160 countries met in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate binding
            
            limits on greenhouse gas emissions for developed nations. The resulting Kyoto Protocol
            
            established emissions targets for each of the participating developed countries&#151;the
            
            Annex I countries<a href="fnote.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a>&#151;relative to their 1990
            
            emissions levels. The targets range from an 8-percent reduction for the European Union (or
            
            its individual member states) to a 10-percent increase allowed for Iceland. The target for
            
            the United States is 7 percent below 1990 levels.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Although atmospheric <i>concentrations</i> of greenhouse gases are thought to have the potential to affect the global climate, the
            
            Protocol establishes targets in terms of <i>annual emissions</i>. Non-Annex I countries
            
            have no targets under the Protocol, but the Protocol reaffirms the commitments of the
            
            Framework Convention by all parties to formulate and implement climate change mitigation
            
            and adaptation programs.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Should the Protocol enter into
            
            force, the emissions targets for the developed countries would have to be achieved on
            
            average over the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The greenhouse gases covered by the
            
            Protocol are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons,
            
            and sulfur hexafluoride. The aggregate target is based on the carbon dioxide equivalent of
            
            each of the greenhouse gases. For the three synthetic greenhouse gases, countries have the
            
            option of using 1995 as the base year.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Several provisions of the
            
            Protocol allow for some flexibility in meeting the emissions targets. Net changes in
            
            emissions by direct anthropogenic land-use changes and forestry activities may be used to
            
            meet the commitment, but they are limited to afforestation, reforestation, and
            
            deforestation since 1990. Emissions trading among the Annex I countries is also allowed.
            
            No rules for trading were established, however, and the Conference of&nbsp;the Parties is
            
            required to establish principles, rules, and guidelines for trading at a future date.
            
            According&nbsp;to&nbsp;estimates presented by the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
            
            in its <i>International Energy Outlook 1998</i>,<a href="fnote.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> there may be 165 million metric tons of carbon permits available from the Annex I
            
            countries of the former Soviet Union in 2010. Greenhouse gas emissions for those countries
            
            as a group are expected to be 165 million metric tons below 1990 levels in 2010 as a
            
            result of the economic decline that has occurred in the region during the 1990s.
            
            Additional carbon permits may also be available, depending on the &#147;carbon price&#148;
            
            that is established in international trading.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Joint implementation projects
            
            are permitted among the Annex I countries, allowing a nation to take emissions credits for
            
            projects that reduce emissions or enhance emissions-absorbing sinks, such as forests and
            
            other vegetation, in other Annex I countries. The Protocol also establishes a Clean
            
            Development Mechanism (CDM), under which Annex I countries can take credits for projects
            
            that reduce emissions in non-Annex I countries. In addition, any group of Annex I
            
            countries may create a bubble or umbrella to meet the total commitment of all the member
            
            nations. In a bubble, countries would agree to meet their total commitment jointly by
            
            allocating a share to each member. In an umbrella arrangement, the total reduction of all
            
            member nations would be met collectively through the trading of emissions rights. There is
            
            potential interest in the United States in entering into an umbrella trading arrangement
            
            with Annex I countries outside the European Union. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In 1990, total greenhouse gas
            
            emissions in the United States were 1,618 million metric tons carbon equivalent.<a href="fnote.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> Of this total, 1,346 million metric tons, or 83
            
            percent, consisted of carbon emissions from the combustion of energy fuels. By 1996, total
            
            U.S. greenhouse gas emissions had risen to 1,753 million metric tons carbon equivalent,
            
            including 1,463 million metric tons of carbon emissions from energy combustion. EIA&#146;s <i>Annual Energy Outlook 1998</i> (<i>AEO98</i>)<a href="fnote.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> projects that energy-related carbon emissions will reach 1,803 million metric tons in
            
            2010, 34 percent above the 1990 level. Because energy-related carbon emissions constitute
            
            such a large percentage of the Nation&#146;s total greenhouse gas emissions, any action or
            
            policy to reduce emissions will have significant implications for U.S. energy markets. </font></p>

            in the United States. Guidelines for those provisions, however, remain to be resolved at
            
            future negotiating meetings, and rules and guidelines for the accounting of emissions and
            
            sinks from activities related to agriculture, land use, and forestry activities must be

            reductions from other sources that a country must undertake. Reductions in the other
            
            greenhouse gases may also offset the reductions required from carbon dioxide. A fact sheet
            
            issued by the U.S. Department of State on January 15, 1998, estimated that the method of
            
            accounting for sinks and the flexibility to use 1995 as the base year for the synthetic

              emissions without any enforced reductions and is presented as a baseline for comparisons
              
              of the energy market impacts in the reduction cases. Although this reference case is based
              
              on the reference case from <i>AEO98</i>, there are small differences between this case and <i>AEO98</i>, in order to permit additional flexibility in response to higher energy
              
              prices or to include certain analyses previously done offline directly within the modeling
              
              framework, such as nuclear plant life extension and generating plant retirements. Also,
              
              some assumptions were modified to reflect more recent assessments of technological
              
              improvements and costs. As a result of these modifications, the projection of
              
              energy-related carbon emissions in 2010 is slightly reduced from the <i>AEO98</i> reference case level of 1,803 million metric tons to 1,791 million metric tons. <br />

Because the Protocol does not specify any targets beyond the first commitment period, the

    target is assumed to hold constant from 2013 through 2020, the end of the forecast horizon

    (although more or less stringent requirements may be set by future Conferences of the

    Parties). The target is assumed to be phased in over a 3-year period, beginning in 2005,

    because the Protocol indicates that demonstrable progress toward reducing emissions must

    be shown by 2005. The phase-in allows energy markets to begin adjustments to meet the

    targets in the absence of complete foresight; however, a longer or more delayed phase-in

    could lower the adjustment costs&#151;an option that is not considered here. In this

    analysis, some carbon reductions are expected to occur before 2005 as the result of

    capacity expansion decisions by electricity generators that incorporate their expectations

    of future increases in energy prices.

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >There are three ways to reduce
      
      energy-related carbon emissions: reducing the demand for energy services, adopting more
      
      energy-efficient equipment, and switching to less carbon-intensive or noncarbon fuels. To
      
      reduce emissions, a carbon price is applied to the cost of energy. The carbon price is
      
      applied to each of the energy fuels relative to its carbon content at its point of
      
      consumption. Electricity does not directly receive a carbon fee; however, the fossil fuels
      
      used for generation receive the fee, and this cost, as well as the increased cost of
      
      investment in generation plants, is reflected in the delivered price of electricity. In
      
      practice, these carbon prices could be imposed through a carbon emissions permit system. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In this analysis, the carbon
      
      prices represent the marginal cost of reducing carbon emissions to the specified level,
      
      reflecting the price the United States would be willing to pay in order to purchase carbon
      
      permits from other countries or to induce carbon reductions in other countries. In the
      
      absence of a complete analysis of trade and other flexible mechanisms to reduce carbon
      
      emissions internationally, the projected carbon prices do not necessarily represent the

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >n 2010, the carbon prices
      
      projected to be necessary to achieve the carbon emissions reduction targets range from $67
      
      per metric ton (1996 dollars) in the 1990+24% case to $348 per metric ton in the 1990-7%

In the 1990+24% case, carbon prices generally increase from 2005 through 2020 (<a href="pdf/tbles2.pdf"><font size="2" face="Arial">Table ES2</font></a> and Figure ES2). In the 1990+14% and 1990+9% cases,

    the carbon prices increase through 2013 and then essentially flatten.
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the three other carbon
  
  reduction cases, the carbon price escalates more rapidly in order to achieve the more
  
  stringent carbon reductions in the commitment period. The carbon price then declines as
  
  cumulative investments in more energy-efficient and lower-carbon equipment, particularly
  
  in the electricity generation sector, reduce the marginal cost of compliance in the later
  
  years of the forecast. These investments reduce the demand for carbon permits over an
  
  extended period of time, offsetting growth in energy demand and
  
  moderating&nbsp;the&nbsp;carbon prices. Figure ES3 shows
  
  the average carbon prices required to achieve the average carbon reductions. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>Sectoral Impacts</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >As a result of the carbon
  
  prices and higher delivered energy prices, the overall intensity of energy use declines in
  
  the carbon reduction cases. Energy intensity, measured in energy consumed per dollar of
  
  gross domestic product (GDP), declines (i.e., improves) at an average annual rate of 1
  
  percent between 2005 and 2010 in the reference case due to the availability and adoption
  
  of more efficient equipment. In the carbon reduction cases, higher rates of improvement
  
  are projected&#151;from 1.6 percent a year in the 1990+24% case to triple the reference
  
  case rate at 3.0 percent a year in the 1990-7% case. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In 2010, reductions in carbon
  
  emissions from electricity generation account for between 68 and 75 percent of the total
  
  carbon reductions across the cases. Electricity consumption is projected to be lower than
  
  in the reference case, with more efficient, less carbon-intensive technologies used for
  
  electricity generation. In all the carbon reduction cases except the 1990+24% case, carbon
  
  emissions from electricity generation in 2010 are lower than the actual 1990 level of 477
  
  million metric tons of carbon emissions from the electricity supply sector. Electricity
  
  generators are expected to respond more strongly than end-use consumers to higher prices
  
  because this industry has traditionally been cost-minimizing, factoring future energy
  
  price increases into investment decisions. In contrast, the end-use consumers are assumed
  
  to consider only current prices in making their investment decisions and to consider
  
  additional factors, not only price, in their decisions. In addition, there are a number of
  
  more efficient and lower-carbon technologies for electricity generation that become
  
  economically available as the cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels increases. </font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
Total electricity generation

    is lower in the carbon reduction cases because electricity sales range from 4 to 17

    percent below the reference case in 2010 (Figure ES4).
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><span><a href="images/es4.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="images/es4.jpg" width="322" /></a><br />
</span></font></p>
Reduction in electricity demand in response to higher electricity prices is somewhat

    mitigated by the change in relative prices. In 2010, electricity prices are between

    20&nbsp;and 86 percent above the reference case across the carbon reduction cases;

    however, delivered natural gas prices are higher by between 25 and 147 percent. With a

    smaller percentage price increase, electricity becomes more attractive in those end uses

    where it competes with natural gas, such as home heating.
    </p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Although reduced demand for
      
      electricity and efficiency improvements in the generation of electricity contribute to the
      
      total reductions in carbon emissions from electricity generation, fuel switching accounts
      
      for most of the reductions (Figure ES5). The delivered
      
      price of coal to generators in 2010 is higher by between 153 and nearly 800 percent in the
      
      carbon reduction cases relative to the reference case. As a result, coal-fired generation,
      
      which accounts for about half of all generation in 2010 in the reference case, has a share
      
      between 42 percent and 12 percent in 2010 in the carbon reduction cases. To replace coal
      
      plants, generators build more natural gas plants, extend the life of existing nuclear
      
      plants, and dramatically increase the use of renewables in the more stringent reduction
      
      cases, particularly biomass and wind energy systems, which become more economical with
      
      higher carbon prices. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Assuming that carbon emissions
      
      from the generation of electricity are shared to each of the end-use demand sectors, based
      
      upon their consumption of electricity, the industrial and residential end-use demand
      
      sectors account for most of the carbon reductions, and the transportation sector accounts
      
      for the least (Figure ES6). In response to higher energy
      
      prices, consumers have an incentive to reduce demand for energy services, switch to
      
      lower-carbon energy sources, and invest in more energy-efficient technologies. </font></p>

      carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels, delivered coal prices are most affected by the
      
      carbon prices (Figure ES7). Higher electricity prices
      
      reflect the increased costs of fossil fuels for generation and the incremental cost of
      
      additional investments, although the increase is mitigated by generation from renewables
      
      and nuclear power, because their fuel prices are not affected by carbon prices. Although
      
      the average carbon content of petroleum products is higher than that of natural gas, the
      
      percentage increase in the price of natural gas is higher than that of petroleum. Higher
      
      prices for petroleum are partially offset by lower world oil prices, and Federal and State
      
      taxes on gasoline also serve to mitigate the percentage increase. </font></p>

      the industrial sector are lower by between 7 and 28 percent in 2010 in the carbon
      
      reduction cases, relative to the reference case. Total industrial output is lower because
      
      of the impact of higher energy prices on the economy. As energy prices increase,
      
      industrial consumers accelerate the replacement of productive capacity, invest in more
      
      efficient technology, and switch to less carbon-intensive fuels. In&nbsp;2010, industrial
      
      energy intensity is reduced from 7.6 thousand British thermal units (Btu) per dollar of
      
      output in the reference case to between 7.4 and 7.1 thousand Btu in the carbon reduction
      
      cases. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In both the residential and
      
      commercial sectors, higher energy prices encourage investments in more efficient equipment
      
      and building shells and reduce the demand for energy services. Total carbon emissions in
      
      the residential sector are reduced by 11 percent in the 1990+24% case and by 45 percent in
      
      the 1990-7% case, relative to the reference case. Because of reduced demand for energy and
      
      improved end-use efficiencies, total energy use in 2010 ranges from 145 to 173 million Btu
      
      per household in the carbon reduction cases, compared with 184 million Btu per household
      
      in the reference case. Space heating and cooling account for the largest share of the
      
      change in energy demand; however, energy demand for a variety of miscellaneous appliances,
      
      such as computers, televisions, and VCRs, is also reduced. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the commercial sector,
      
      total carbon emissions are lower by between 12 and 51 percent in the carbon reduction
      
      cases, compared to the reference case. Total energy use per square foot of commercial
      
      floorspace, which is 206 thousand Btu in 2010 in the reference case, is reduced to between
      
      148 and 192 thousand Btu across the cases. Similar to the residential sector, most of the
      
      reduction occurs for space conditioning&#151;heating, cooling, and ventilation; however,
      
      more efficient lighting and office equipment and reduced miscellaneous electricity
      
      use&#151;for example, for vending machines and telecommunications equipment&#151;also
      
      contribute to lower energy consumption. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The average price of gasoline
      
      in 2010 across the carbon reduction cases is between 11 and 53 percent higher than the
      
      projected reference case price. Carbon reductions in the transportation sector in 2010
      
      range from 2 to 16 percent, primarily as the result of reduced travel and the purchase of
      
      more efficient vehicles. The relatively low carbon reductions for transportation result
      
      from the continued dominance of petroleum, although some increase in market share is
      
      projected for alternative-fuel vehicles. Improvements in average fuel efficiency are
      
      slowed by vehicle turnover rates. Although new car efficiency in 2010 improves from 30.6
      
      miles per gallon in the reference case to between 32.0 and 36.4 miles per gallon in the
      
      carbon reduction cases, total light-duty fleet efficiency rises only from 20.5 miles per
      
      gallon to between 20.7 and 21.7 miles per gallon. The impact of carbon prices on the
      
      economy lowers light-duty vehicle and airline travel and freight requirements while
      
      inducing some efficiency improvements. </font></p>

    </span></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because of the higher relative
      
      carbon content of coal and petroleum products, the use of both fuels is reduced, and there
      
      is a greater reliance on natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. Although the
      
      use of petroleum declines relative to the reference case, it increases slightly as a share
      
      because most petroleum is used in the transportation sector, where fewer fuel substitutes
      
      are available. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because of the high carbon
      
      content of coal, total domestic coal consumption is significantly reduced in the carbon
      
      reduction cases, by between 18 and 77 percent relative to the reference case in 2010 (Figure ES9). Most of the reductions are for electricity
      
      generation, where coal is replaced by natural gas, renewable fuels, and nuclear power;
      
      however, demand for industrial steam coal and metallurgical coal is also reduced because
      
      of a shift to natural gas in industrial boilers and a reduction in industrial output. Coal
      
      exports are also lower in the carbon reduction cases, by between 21 and 32 percent, due to
      
      lower demand for coal in the Annex I nations. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Although total U.S. coal
      
      production is reduced, the average minemouth coal price rises in the carbon reduction
      
      cases, by between 3 and 28 percent in 2010, because a larger share of production is from
      
      higher-cost eastern coal mines that tend to serve the remaining markets. Production of
      
      western coal is further discouraged by the higher cost of fuels used for rail
      
      transportation and by reduced incentive for investment in new mines, which are primarily
      
      in the West. Because of lower coal production, coal mine employment in 2010 is projected
      
      to be 15 to 63 percent lower than in the reference case; however, employment in the energy
      
      industry related to the production of natural gas and renewable fuels is likely to
      
      increase. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Petroleum consumption is lower
      
      in all the carbon reduction cases than in the reference case, by between 2 and 13 percent (Figure ES10). Because most of the petroleum is used for
      
      transportation, between 68 and 82 percent of the total reduction is in the transportation
      
      sector, as travel and freight requirements are reduced and higher-efficiency vehicles are
      
      used. Because of lower petroleum demand in the United States and in other developed
      
      countries that are committed to reducing emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, world oil
      
      prices are lower by between 4 and 16 percent in 2010, relative to the reference case price
      
      of $20.77 per barrel. In 2010, net crude oil and petroleum product imports are lower by a
      
      range of 3 to 22 percent relative to the reference case. Consequently, the dependency of
      
      the United States on imported petroleum is reduced from the reference case level of 59
      
      percent to as little as 53 percent in 2010. </font></p>

      natural gas in the generation sector is only partially offset by reductions in the end-use
      
      sectors. Later in the&nbsp;forecast period, continued growth in natural gas consumption
      
      for electricity generation is mitigated by the increasing use of renewables and nuclear
      
      power, particularly in the more stringent carbon reduction cases. As a result, in 2020,
      
      natural gas use does not necessarily increase with higher levels of carbon reductions. As
      
      the result of higher demand, the average wellhead price of natural gas in 2010 is higher
      
      in all the carbon cases than in the reference case, by a range of 2 to 30 percent.

      energy, which results in no net carbon emissions, is projected to be significantly higher
      
      with carbon reduction targets (Figure ES13). Across the
      
      carbon reduction cases, renewable energy consumption increases by between 2 and 16 percent
      
      in 2010 and by between 9 and 70 percent in 2020. Most of this increase occurs in
      
      electricity generation, primarily with additions to wind energy systems and an increase in
      
      the use of biomass (wood, switchgrass, and refuse). In the carbon reduction cases, the
      
      share of renewable generation is as much as 14 percent in 2010, compared with 10 percent

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the energy market analyses,
      
      the projected carbon prices reflect the prices the United States would be willing to pay
      
      to achieve the Kyoto targets, without addressing the international trade in carbon
      
      permits. The macroeconomic analysis assumes that the carbon permit trading system would
      
      function as an auction run by the Federal Government, and that the United States would be
      
      free to purchase carbon permits in an international market at the marginal abatement cost
      
      in the United States. The U.S. State Department&#146;s assessment of the accounting of
      
      carbon-absorbing sinks and offsets from reductions in other greenhouse gases is assumed to
      
      reduce the U.S. emissions target to 3 percent below 1990 levels. The 3-percent target is
      
      then achieved through a combination of domestic actions and the purchase of permits on the
      
      international market. Thus, two flows of funds occur&#151;domestic and international. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >On the domestic side, U.S.
      
      permits are sold in a competitive auction run by the Federal Government, raising large
      
      sums of funds. In the 1990-3% case, where the revenues come entirely from the domestic
      
      market, the revenue collected in 2010 is projected to total $585 billion nominal dollars
      
      and $317 billion and $128 billion in the 1990+9% and 1990+24% cases, respectively. The
      
      collection of this money necessitates a careful consideration of appropriate fiscal policy
      
      to accompany the permit auction. Two approaches are considered: first, returning collected
      
      revenues to consumers through a personal income tax lump sum rebate and, second, lowering
      
      social security tax rates as they apply to both employers and employees. The two policies
      
      are meant only to be representative of a set of possible fiscal policies that might
      
      accompany an initial carbon mitigation policy. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The second flow of funds is
      
      associated with U.S. purchases of international carbon permits and assumes that the carbon
      
      price determined in the U.S. energy market analysis is the international price at which
      
      permits would be traded. The differences between the reduction level in the 1990-3% case
      
      and those in the other cases are assumed to be met by purchases of permits in
      
      international markets. <a href="tbles3.html">Table ES3</a> shows average carbon
      
      reductions, purchases of international permits, and the carbon price for the three cases

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The energy market analysis in
      
      this report does not address the international implications of achieving a particular
      
      target at the projected carbon price. For the macroeconomic assessment, the simplifying
      
      assumption is made that in each case the domestic carbon price is the same as the
      
      international permit price when different levels of trading are used to achieve the Kyoto
      
      target, implying that different international supplies of permits would be available in
      
      the alternative cases considered. This is an important simplifying assumption, and the
      
      value placed on the overseas transfer of funds to purchase international permits is
      
      subject to considerable uncertainty. However, this element must be considered a key factor
      
      in performing any assessment of the impacts on the economy, and therefore it is explicitly
      
      factored into the analysis. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >As a direct consequence of the
      
      carbon price, aggregate energy prices in the U.S. economy are expected to rise. One way to
      
      measure this effect is to look at the percentage change in prices in the economy. For
      
      example, in the 1990+9% case, energy prices are 56 percent higher than the reference case
      
      projection in 2010 and remain more than 50 percent above the reference case over the rest
      
      of the forecast period. The projected energy price increases would also affect downstream
      
      prices for all goods and services in the economy as measured by the producer price index.
      
      The projected increase in producer prices relative to the reference case in 2010 is 9
      
      percent in the 1990+9% case. Final prices for goods and services in 2009, as shown by the
      
      consumer price index (CPI) series, are about 4 percent higher in the 1990+9% case (Figure ES14). Expressed as a rate of change, CPI inflation
      
      rises by 0.7 percentage points between 2005 and 2010, as the reference case CPI rises by
      
      3.6 percent a year and the 1990+9% case rises by 4.3 percent a year. These figures suggest
      
      the following rule of thumb for the year 2010: each 10-percent increase in aggregate
      
      prices for energy may lead to a 1.5-percent increase in producer prices and a 0.7-percent
      
      increase in consumer prices. </font></p>

    </span></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >One aspect of the CPI is
      
      particularly noteworthy. The CPI measures the prices that consumers face, regardless of
      
      the country of origin of the product. Import prices, to the extent that they do not rise
      
      at the rate of domestic prices because non-Annex I countries do not face carbon
      
      constraints, would dampen the price effects as lower-priced imports find their way into
      
      U.S. markets. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because energy resources are
      
      used to produce most goods and services, higher energy prices can affect the
      
      economy&#146;s production potential. Long-run equilibrium costs are associated with
      
      reducing reliance on energy in favor of other factors of production&#151;including labor
      
      and capital, which become relatively cheaper as energy costs rise. Short-run adjustment
      
      costs, or business cycle costs, can arise when price increases disrupt capital or
      
      employment markets. Long-run costs are considered unavoidable. Short-run costs might be
      
      avoidable if price changes can be accurately anticipated or if appropriate compensatory
      
      monetary and fiscal policies can be implemented. The economic assessment in this analysis
      
      considers both the short-run and long-run costs to the economy and focuses on the 1990-3%,
      
      1990+9%, and 1990+24% carbon reduction cases. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The possible impacts on the

      from the reference case projections over the period from 2008 through 2012 in the three
      
      carbon reduction analysis cases. The <i>loss of potential GDP</i> measures the loss in
      
      productive capacity of the economy directly attributable to the reduction in energy
      
      resources available to the economy. The <i>macroeconomic adjustment cost</i> reflects
      
      frictions in the economy that may result from the higher prices of the carbon mitigation
      
      policy. It recognizes the possibility that cyclical adjustments may occur in the short
      
      run. The <i>loss in actual GDP</i> for the economy is the sum of the loss in potential and
      
      the adjustment cost. The <i>purchase of international permits</i> represents a claim on
      
      the productive capacity of domestic U.S. resources. Essentially, as funds flow abroad,
      
      other countries have an increased claim on U.S. goods and services. </font></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    The loss of potential GDP plus

    the purchase of international permits represent the long-run, unavoidable impact on the

These costs need to be put in perspective relative to the size of the ecomomy, which

    averages $9,425 billion between 2008 and 2012. <a href="pdf/tbles56.pdf"><font size="2" face="Arial">Tables ES5</font></a> and <a href="pdf/tbles56.pdf"><font size="2" face="Arial">ES6</font></a> summarize the macroeconomic impacts projected for

    the years 2010 and 2020.
    </p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the long run, higher energy
      
      costs would reduce the&nbsp;use of energy by shifting production toward less
      
      energy-intensive sectors, by replacing energy with labor and capital in specific
      
      production processes, and by encouraging energy conservation. Although reflecting a more
      
      efficient use of higher-cost energy, the gradual reduction in energy use would tend to
      
      lower the productivity of other factors in the production process. The derivation of the
      
      long-run equilibrium path of the economy can be characterized as representing the
      
      &#147;potential&#148; output of the economy when all resources&#151; labor, capital, and
      
      energy&#151;are fully employed. As such, potential GDP is equivalent to the full
      
      employment concept in other analyses that focus on long-run growth while abstracting from
      
      business cycle behavior. Figure ES16 shows the losses in
      
      the potential economic output, as measured by potential GDP, for the three carbon
      
      reduction cases. The shapes of the three trajectories mirror the carbon price
      
      trajectories. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The ultimate impacts of carbon
      
      mitigation policies on the economy will be determined by complex interactions between
      
      elements of aggregate supply and demand, in conjunction with monetary and fiscal policy
      
      decisions. As such, cyclical impacts on the economy are&nbsp;bound to be characterized by
      
      uncertainty and controversy. However, raising the price of energy and downstream prices in
      
      the rest of the economy could introduce cyclical behavior in the economy, resulting in
      
      employment and output losses in the short run. The measurement of losses in actual output
      
      for the economy, or actual GDP, represents the transitional cost to the aggregate economy
      
      as it adjusts to its long-run path. Resources may be less than fully employed, and
      
      the&nbsp;economy may move in a cyclical fashion as the initial&nbsp;cause of the
      
      disturbance&#151;the increase in energy prices&#151;plays out over time. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Collection of money from a
      
      permit auction system necessitates a careful consideration of appropriate fiscal policy to
      
      accompany the carbon reduction policy. Two alternative fiscal policies are analyzed, both
      
      returning collected revenue back to agents in the economy: a cut in personal income taxes
      
      and a cut in social security taxes as they apply to both employers and employees. In both
      
      cases, the Federal deficit is maintained at reference case levels. The personal income tax
      
      cut essentially returns collected revenues to consumers, helping to maintain personal
      
      disposable income. Like the personal income tax cut, the social security tax cut returns
      
      collected funds to the private sector of the economy, ameliorating the near-term impacts
      
      of higher energy prices. Although consumers and businesses still would face much higher
      
      relative prices for energy than for other goods and services, disposable income is
      
      maintained near reference case values to the extent that funds flow back to consumers. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the fiscal policy settings,
      
      higher prices in the economy place upward pressure on interest rates. The Federal Reserve
      
      Board seeks to balance the consequences of higher energy prices on the economy and
      
      possible adverse effects on output and employment by making adjustments to the Federal
      
      funds rate. The adjustments would be designed to moderate the possible impacts on both
      
      inflation and unemployment, and to return the economy to its long-run growth path. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Figure
      
      ES17 shows the projected impacts on both actual and potential GDP for the two
      
      hypothetical fiscal policies (income tax and social security tax cuts) in the 1990+9%
      
      case. The figure indicates that, in the 2008 to 2012 period, the short-run cyclical impact
      
      on actual GDP is larger than the long-run impact on potential GDP; however, the two output
      
      concepts begin to converge by 2015, and by 2020 they have merged into a steady-state path
      
      reflected by potential GDP. Monetary policy is instrumental in balancing inflation and
      
      unemployment impacts through the adjustment period, acting in a manner to bring the
      
      economy back to its long-run growth path. </font></p>

    </span></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The choice of the
      
      accommodating fiscal policy is also key to the assessment of the ultimate impacts on the
      
      economy. While the personal income tax option moderates the impacts through a return of
      
      funds to consumers, the social security tax option has cost-cutting aspects of lowering
      
      the employer portion of the tax, which serves to reduce inflationary pressures in the
      
      aggregate economy. On the employer side, the reduction in employer contributions to the
      
      social security system would lower costs to the firm and, thereby, moderate the near-term
      
      price consequences to the economy. Since it is the price effect that produces the
      
      predominately negative effect on the economy, any steps to reduce inflationary pressures
      
      would serve to moderate adverse impacts on the aggregate economy. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Another way to view the
      
      macroeconomic effects is by looking at the effects of the carbon reduction cases on the
      
      growth rate of the economy, both during the period of implementation from 2005 through
      
      2010 and then over the entire period from 2005 through 2020 (Figures
      
      ES18 and ES19). In the reference case, potential and
      
      actual GDP grow at 2.0 percent per year from 2005 through 2010. In the 1990+9% case, the
      
      growth rate in potential GDP slows to 1.9 percent per year, and the growth rate in actual
      
      GDP slows to 1.6 percent per year when the personal income tax rebate is assumed or 1.8
      
      percent per year when the social security tax rebate is assumed. However, through 2020,
      
      with the economy rebounding back to the reference case path, there is no appreciable
      
      change in the projected long-term growth rate. The results for the 1990+24% and 1990-3%
      
      cases are similar. </font></p>

      GDP per capita is $106; however, the loss in actual GDP for in the 1990+9% case is $567
      
      assuming the personal income tax rebate and $305 assuming the social security tax rebate.
      
      Again, the lower value (loss in potential GDP) represents an unavoidable loss per person,
      
      and the higher values (loss in actual GDP) reflect the highly uncertain, but significant,
      
      impacts that individuals could experience as the result of frictions within the economy.

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" ><b>Sensitivity Cases</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >This analysis includes several
      
      sensitivity cases designed to examine alternative assumptions that may have significant
      
      impacts on energy demand and carbon emissions over the next 20 years, including higher and
      
      lower economic growth, faster and slower availability and rates of improvement in
      
      technology, and the construction of new nuclear power plants. The sensitivity cases
      
      illustrate how such factors influence the results of the carbon reduction cases. With the
      
      exception of the nuclear power case, the sensitivity cases are analyzed relative to the
      
      1990+9% case. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because each sensitivity case
      
      is constrained to the same level of carbon emissions as the case to which it is compared,
      
      the primary impact is not on the carbon emissions levels, or even on aggregate energy
      
      consumption, but rather on the carbon price required to meet the emissions target. For
      
      example, in the high technology case, projected carbon emissions during the compliance
      
      period are the same as in the corresponding reference technology case. What differs is the
      
      cost of meeting the target, as reflected in the required carbon price. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The assumed rate of economic
      
      growth has a strong impact on the projection of energy consumption and, therefore, on the
      
      projected levels of carbon emissions. Two sensitivity cases explore the effects of higher
      
      and&nbsp;lower economic growth on the cost of reducing carbon emissions to the 1990+9%
      
      level. Higher economic&nbsp;growth results from higher assumed growth in population, the
      
      labor force, and labor productivity, resulting in higher industrial output, lower
      
      inflation, and lower interest rates. As a result, GDP increases at an average rate of 2.4
      
      percent a year through 2020, compared with a growth rate of 1.9 percent a year in the
      
      reference case. With higher macroeconomic growth, energy demand grows faster, as higher
      
      manufacturing output and higher income increase the demand for energy services, resulting
      
      in higher carbon emissions. Assumptions of lower growth in population, the labor force,
      
      and labor productivity result in an average annual growth rate of 1.3 percent in the low
      
      economic growth case, resulting in lower carbon emissions. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >With higher economic growth,
      
      both industrial output and energy service demand are higher. As a result, carbon prices
      
      must be correspondingly higher to attain a&nbsp;given carbon emissions target. In the high
      
      macroeconomic growth case, the carbon price in 2010 is $215 per metric ton, $52 per metric
      
      ton higher than the carbon price of $163 per metric ton in the 1990+9% case with reference
      
      growth assumptions (Figure ES20). In the low
      
      macroeconomic growth case, the carbon price in 2010 is $128 per metric ton. The higher
      
      carbon prices necessary to achieve the carbon reductions with higher economic growth have
      
      a negative impact on the economy and the energy system. Nevertheless, total energy
      
      consumption in 2010 is higher with higher economic growth, by 2.2 quadrillion Btu relative
      
      to the 1990+9% case, which assumes the same economic growth rate as the reference case. In
      
      the low economic growth case, total energy consumption is lower by 2.2 quadrillion Btu in

      total energy consumption in the industrial and transportation sectors more significantly
      
      than in the other end-use sectors. Total consumption of both renewables and natural gas is
      
      higher, primarily for electricity generation but also in the industrial sector. Coal use
      
      for generation is lower, and the use of nuclear power is higher as a result of the higher
      
      carbon prices. Petroleum consumption is also higher with higher economic growth, both in
      
      the transportation and industrial sectors. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Total energy intensity is
      
      lower in the high economic growth case, partially offsetting the increases in the demand
      
      for energy services caused by the higher growth assumption. With higher economic growth,
      
      there is greater opportunity to turn over and improve the stock of energy-using
      
      technologies. In addition, the higher carbon price induces more efficiency improvements
      
      and some offsetting reductions in energy service demand, moderating the impacts of higher
      
      economic growth. With higher economic growth, aggregate energy intensity declines at an
      
      average annual rate of 1.9 percent through 2010, compared to 1.6 percent with reference
      
      economic growth. The opposite effects on energy intensity occur with lower economic
      
      growth, with the decline in energy intensity slowing from 1.6 percent to 1.3 percent
      
      between 1996 and 2010. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>Technological Progress</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The rates of development and
      
      market penetration of energy-using technologies have a significant impact on projected
      
      energy consumption and energy-related carbon emissions. Faster development of more
      
      energy-efficient or lower-carbon-emitting technologies than assumed in the reference case
      
      could reduce both consumption and emissions; however, because the reference case already
      
      assumes continued improvement in both energy consumption and production technologies,
      
      slower technological development is also possible. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >To analyze the impacts of
      
      technology improvement, high technology assumptions were developed by experts in
      
      technology engineering for each of the energy-consuming sectors, considering the potential
      
      impacts of increased research and development for more advanced technologies. The revised
      
      assumptions included earlier years of introduction, lower costs, higher maximum market
      
      potential, and higher efficiencies than assumed in the reference case.<a href="fnote.html#9"><sup>9</sup></a>Also, this sensitivity case assumed the availability
      
      of carbon sequestration technology for coal- and natural-gas-fired power plants, which
      
      would remove carbon dioxide and store it in underground aquifers; however, the technology
      
      is uneconomical relative to other technologies because of its high operating and storage
      
      costs. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >These technological
      
      improvements were developed under the assumption of increased research and development,
      
      and they are distinct from the more rapid adoption of advanced technologies that occurs
      
      with higher energy prices in the carbon reduction cases. It is possible that further
      
      technology improvements could occur beyond those in the high technology sensitivity case
      
      if a very aggressive research and development effort were established. The low technology
      
      sensitivity case assumes that all future equipment choices are made from the end-use and
      
      generation equipment available in 1998, with new building shell and industrial plant
      
      efficiencies frozen at 1998 levels. Comparing this sensitivity case to a case with
      
      reference technology assumptions demonstrates the importance of technology improvement in
      
      the reference case. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Because faster technology
      
      development makes advanced energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies more economically
      
      attractive, the carbon prices required to meet carbon reduction levels are significantly
      
      reduced. Conversely, slower technology improvement requires higher carbon prices (Figure
      
      ES20). With high technology assumptions, the carbon price in 2010 is $121 per metric ton,
      
      $42 per metric ton lower than the carbon price of $163 per metric ton in the 1990+9% case
      
      with the reference technology assumptions. With the low technology assumptions, the carbon
      
      price increases to $243 per metric ton in 2010. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the high technology
      
      sensitivity case, total energy consumption in 2010 is lower by 2.1 quadrillion Btu, or
      
      about 2 percent, than in the 1990+9% case with reference technology. Delivered energy
      
      consumption in both the industrial and transportation sectors is lower as efficiency
      
      improvements in industrial processes and most transportation modes outweigh the
      
      countervailing effects of lower energy prices. In the residential and commercial sectors,
      
      the effect of lower energy prices balances the effect of advanced technology, and
      
      consumption levels are at or near those in the reference technology (1990+9%) case. In the
      
      generation sector, coal use for generation is 40 percent higher than with reference
      
      technology assumptions, due to efficiency improvements and the lower carbon price. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the low technology
      
      sensitivity case, the converse trends prevail. In 2010, total energy consumption is higher
      
      by 1.5 quadrillion Btu than in the 1990+9% case with reference technology assumptions.
      
      Delivered energy consumption is higher in the industrial and transportation sectors and
      
      lower in the residential and commercial sectors, suggesting that industry and
      
      transportation are more sensitive to technology changes than to price changes, and the
      
      residential and commercial sectors are more sensitive to price changes. With the higher
      
      carbon prices in the low technology case, coal use is further reduced in the generation
      
      sector, and more natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables are used to meet the carbon
      
      reduction targets. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" ><b>Nuclear Power</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In the reference case, nuclear
      
      electricity generation declines significantly because 52 percent of the total nuclear
      
      capacity available in 1996 is assumed to be retired by 2020. A number of units are retired
      
      before the end of their 40-year operating licenses, as suggested by industry announcements
      
      and analysis of the age and operating costs of the units. In the carbon reduction cases,
      
      life extension of the plants can occur if it is economical; and there is an increasing
      
      incentive to invest in nuclear plant refurbishment with higher carbon prices. However,
      
      these cases do not allow the construction of new nuclear power plants, given continuing
      
      high capital investment costs and institutional constraints associated with nuclear power.
      
      A nuclear power sensitivity case examines the impact of allowing new plants to be
      
      constructed. Because nuclear plants still are not economically competitive with fossil and
      
      renewable plants in the 1990+9% case, the nuclear power sensitivity case was analyzed
      
      against the 1990-3% case. In addition to allowing new nuclear plants, the higher costs
      
      assumed in the reference case for the first few advanced nuclear plants were reduced in
      
      this sensitivity. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Relative to the 1990-3% case,
      
      1 gigawatt of new nuclear capacity is added by 2010 in the nuclear power sensitivity case,
      
      and 41 gigawatts, representing about 68 new plants of 600 megawatts each, are added by
      
      2020. With most of the impact from the new nuclear plants coming after the commitment
      
      period of 2008 through 2012, there is little impact on carbon prices in 2010. By 2020,
      
      however, carbon prices are $199 per metric ton with the assumption of new nuclear plants,
      
      as compared with $240 per metric ton in the 1990-3% case with the reference nuclear
      
      assumptions. In 2010, total energy consumption is about the same in this sensitivity case
      
      as in the 1990-3% case, but in 2020 it is about 1.8 quadrillion Btu higher. Somewhat lower
      
      energy prices induce higher consumption in all sectors, and the availability of more
      
      carbon-free nuclear generation allows the carbon reduction target to be met with higher
      
      end-use consumption. </font></p>

      Analysis</b></font><font face="Arial" size="5"> </font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >The reference case projections
      
      in both <i>AEO98</i> and this analysis represent business-as-usual forecasts, given known
      
      trends in technology and demographics, current laws and regulations, and the specific
      
      methodologies and assumptions used by EIA. Because EIA does not include future legislative
      
      and regulatory changes in its reference case projections, the projections provide a
      
      policy-neutral baseline against which the impacts of policy initiatives can be analyzed. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Results from any model or
      
      analysis are highly uncertain. By their nature, energy models are simplified
      
      representations of complex energy markets. The results of any analysis are highly
      
      dependent on the specific data, assumptions, behavioral characteristics, methodologies,
      
      and model structures included. In addition, many of the factors that influence the future
      
      development of energy markets are highly uncertain, including weather, political and
      
      economic disruptions, technology development, and policy initiatives. Recognizing these
      
      uncertainties, EIA has attempted in this study to isolate and analyze the most important
      
      factors affecting future carbon emissions and carbon prices. The results of the various
      
      cases and sensitivities should be considered as relative changes to the comparative
      
      baseline cases. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >In addition to the
      
      uncertainties concerning the final interpretation and implementation of the Kyoto
      
      Protocol, specific actions that might be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the
      
      United States have not been formulated. Actions taken by other Annex I countries to reduce
      
      emissions, future growth in worldwide energy consumption and emissions, and the
      
      opportunities for reducing emissions through joint implementation and the CDM are unknown,
      
      and they are likely to have important impacts on the international trade of carbon permits
      
      and the carbon permit price. This analysis assumes that auctioned permits will constrain
      
      carbon emissions and raise the price of fossil fuels, with revenues from the auction
      
      recycled to consumers either through personal income tax or social security tax rebates.
      
      Alternative carbon reduction programs and fiscal policies would be likely to change the
      
      cost of carbon reduction from the costs in this analysis. The timing of carbon reduction
      
      programs and the amount of adjustment time allowed could also be important in determining
      
      costs. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Future technology development
      
      also cannot be known with certainty and may have a significant effect on the cost of
      
      achieving carbon reductions. The technology sensitivity cases in this analysis explore
      
      some of the potential impacts, but even the high technology sensitivity does not include
      
      possible breakthrough or speculative technologies. On the other hand, even the reference
      
      case technology assumptions include continued development of more energy-efficient and
      
      renewable technologies, which serve to mitigate the costs of carbon reduction. Those
      
      technology improvements are likely, but not certain. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" >Finally, consumer response to
      
      carbon initiatives is uncertain. Because energy price changes that have occurred in the
      
      past may not provide sufficient evidence about the reaction of consumers to sustained high
      
      energy prices, changes in demand as a result of the higher carbon fees cannot be projected
      
      with confidence. In addition to price-induced changes, consumers might also respond to
      
      climate change initiatives and a national commitment to reduce emissions by adopting more
      
      energy-efficient or renewable technologies sooner than expected. Finally, public
      
      acceptance of large-scale renewable technologies or the continuation of nuclear
      
      power&#151;both of which make important contributions to the achievement of the carbon
