<title>Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Analysis of Oil and Gas Production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</title>
<!-- ****************************************** Begin META TAGS ********************************************* -->
<meta name="Energy Information Administration" content="This report responds to a request from Congressman Richard Pombo received on February 23, 2004, to analyze the impact on future oil imports and expenditures of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to petroleum development. High, low, and mean ANWR oil resource cases are compared to the Annual Energy Outlook 2004 reference case. The study also examines whether potential synergies exist in opening ANWR to petroleum development and the construction of an Alaska gas pipeline from the North Slope to the lower 48-States.">

      <p class="report_summary">19 United States Geological Survey, <em>U.S. Geological Survey 2002 Petroleum Resource Assessment of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPRA)</em>, USGS Fact Sheet 045-02, Table 1, and personal communication on March 1, 2004, with Emil Attanasi, Ph.D., U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. Estimates include NPRA, native lands, and adjacent offshore areas within a 3-mile boundary surrounding NPRA. The USGS mean gas resource estimates for NPRA are 61 tcf for non-associated gas and 12 tcf for associated-dissolved natural gas. The NPRA figures cited in the text represent the 95-percent and 5-percent probability gas resource estimates, respectively. Associated-dissolved natural gas is co-located with crude oil in a reservoir, while non-associated gas is found without any crude oil in a reservoir. </p>
      <p class="report_summary">20 U.S. Geological Survey, <em>The Oil and Gas Resource Potential of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 1002 Area</em>, Alaska Open File Report 98-34, Table AO3. Gas resource estimates include Federal lands, Native lands, and the State offshore area within the 3-mile limit. </p>
      <p class="report_summary">21 Ibid. Table EA3. These associated-dissolved gas figures are for the Federal lands portion of ANWR only (ie, the 1002 Area) and do not include the Native lands and the 3-mile offshore portions of the ANWR coastal plain. The more inclusive gas resources estimates were not available from USGS at the time of publication. </p>
      <p class="report_summary">22 The phrase &ldquo;might reduce&rdquo; is used in this context because this resource risk is only reduced if large volumes of natural gas are, in fact, found in ANWR. However, the finding of such resources can only occur if ANWR is opened to exploration and development. If ANWR is opened to petroleum development and no large gas deposits are found, then the pipeline&rsquo;s resource risk remains unchanged.</p>
