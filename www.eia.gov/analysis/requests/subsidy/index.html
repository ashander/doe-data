        <h1 align="left">Direct Federal Financial Interventions and Subsidies in Energy in Fiscal Year 2013</h1>
      <p class="dat"> Release date: March 12, 2015<br />
      Revised: March 23, 2015 (<a class="lightbox" href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/revision_notice.cfm">revision</a>) </p>
      <br />
        <h2 style="font-size:20px">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>This report responds to a September 2014 request to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) from U.S. Representative Fred Upton,  Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and U.S. Representative Ed Whitfield, Chairman of its Subcommittee on Energy and Power, for an update reflecting  Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 data of two earlier EIA reports on direct federal  financial interventions and subsidies in energy markets covering FY 2007 and FY  2010.</p>
        <p> As in the prior EIA reports on this subject, the scope of  the present report is limited to direct federal financial interventions and  subsidies that are provided by the federal government, provide a financial  benefit with an identifiable federal budget impact, and are specifically  targeted at energy markets. As requested, the report focuses on subsidies to  electricity production and also includes subsidies to federal electric  utilities in the form of financial support.</p>
<p>Given its scope, the report does not encompass  all subsidies beneficial to energy sector activities (see text  entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/sies.cfm">Not  All Subsidies Impacting the Energy Sector Are Included in this Report</a>&rdquo;), which should  be kept in mind when comparing this report to other studies that may use  narrower or more expansive inclusion criteria. Consistent with EIA's role and  mission, this study focuses on developing data rather than drawing conclusions  or discussing policy issues related to subsidies, and in that regard differs  from some other reports that address energy subsidies (see text entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/dmeess.cfm">A Wide Variety of Definitions, Methods and Estimates Occur in Other Energy Subsidy Studies</a>&quot;). </p>

      <h2>Subsidy categories</h2>
      <P>Energy subsidies and interventions discussed in this report are divided into five separate program categories:</p>
      <P><strong>Direct expenditures to producers or consumers.</strong> These are federal programs that provide direct cash outlays which provide a financial benefit to producers or consumers of energy.<sup><a href="index.html#1">1</a></sup></p>
      <P><strong>Tax expenditures.</strong> These are largely provisions found in the Internal  Revenue Code (IRC, or Tax Code)&#8212;Title 26 of the United States Code&#8212;that reduce  the tax liability of firms or individuals who take specified actions that  affect energy production, distribution, transmission, consumption, or  conservation. </p>
      <p><strong>Research and development</strong>. The federal government has an extensive program  of funding energy research and development (R&amp;D) activities aimed at a  variety of goals, such as increasing U.S. energy supplies or improving the  efficiency of various energy consumption, production, transformation, and  end-use technologies. R&amp;D programs generally do not directly affect current  energy consumption, production, and prices, but if successful, they could  affect future consumption, production, and prices.</p>
      <div class="tie_correction">
<h2 style="font-size:16px">Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance</h2>
<p>This report uses the General Services Administration's (GSA) <em>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance </em>to  identify energy-related programs. Energy-related programs exist in many federal  agencies but are heavily concentrated at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).</p>
<p>  EIA identified over 70 federal domestic assistance programs,  many of which have multiple subprograms, as part of direct or research and  development expenditures displayed in this report. However, some agencies  administer one large, single program &#8211; e.g., the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) administers the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program  (LIHEAP) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) administers the  Section 1603 grant program.</p>
<p>DOE operates the most programs and the greatest  number of fossil, efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. The U.S. Department  of Agriculture (USDA) also operates several programs. A few programs can also  be found among the Departments of the Interior (DOI), Labor (DOL), and Housing  and Urban Development (HUD).</p>      </div>
<br />
      <p><strong>Federal electricity programs supporting federal  and rural utilities</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em>Through federal utilities, including the  Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), and  three smaller Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), the federal government  brings to market large amounts of electricity, stipulating that &ldquo;preference in  the sale of such power and energy shall be given to public bodies and  cooperatives.&rdquo;<a href="index.html#2"><sup>2 </sup></a>The federal government also supports portions of  the electricity industry through loans and loan guarantees made by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) at interest rates  generally below those available to investor-owned utilities (IOUs). This report  measures support provided by RUS and federal electricity programs by comparing  an average annual interest expense for their long-term debt to a range of cost  of capital for IOUs that they might otherwise have incurred in the absence of  federal support. Costs are based upon the savings realized from borrowing at  preferential rates compared to market rates. Rather than choosing a single  benchmark interest rate to estimate the cost of these programs, a range of  borrowing costs starting with the 30-year Treasury rate through the Baa IOU  interest rate were used.<a href="index.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> To facilitate exposition, the Executive Summary  presents only midpoint value estimates for these programs.</p>
      <p><strong>Loans and loan guarantees.</strong>The federal government provides financial  support for certain energy technologies either by guaranteeing the repayment of  loans obtained in the private debt market or by lending money directly to  energy market participants. DOE is authorized to provide financial support for  innovative clean energy technologies that are typically unable to obtain  conventional private financing due to their high technology risks. In addition,  eligible technologies must avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or  anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.<a href="index.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> The authority to enter into loan guarantees under Section 1705 (added by the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, referred to as ARRA in this report) of Title  XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005&#8212;a temporary program for the rapid  deployment of renewable energy and electric power transmission projects administered  by DOE&#8212;expired, pursuant to statute, on September 30, 2011. Further, as noted  in Section 5 of this report, no loans were made in FY 2013; hence, discussion  in this report is limited. Additional information on this topic is available in  EIA&rsquo;s prior subsidy report.</p>
      <p>For this report, EIA relies upon many of the data  sources and budget documents<a href="index.html#5"><sup>5</sup> </a>used in EIA&rsquo;s prior subsidy reports to measure  the cost of programs to the federal budget. One significant enhancement is the  use of a comprehensive public database summarizing all federal budget  obligations that is available through <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/">USASpending.gov</a>.  For federal agencies other than DOE and Treasury, spending for FY 2010 and FY  2013 is reported based on the obligations reported on that website. Under  steady-state conditions, where outlays follow obligations in a regular pattern  and there are no sharp discontinuities in the former or the latter, obligation  and outlay measures closely correspond. However, with enactment of ARRA, which provided  energy funding that dwarfed DOE&rsquo;s previous energy program budgets and also  required the rapid obligation of funds that would fund outlays over several years,  EIA faced a decision whether to tally spending based on obligations or outlays.  Given the multi-year outlays from a 20-year high in budget authority created  under ARRA, and the fact that the tax expenditures and grants that constitute  the other major spending programs considered in this study are reported in the  year where the grant or credit is claimed, EIA determined that that the  purposes of the report would be best served by reporting DOE programs based on  outlays, using information obtained from DOE's Office of the Chief Financial  Officer. Like DOE, Treasury&rsquo;s program is reported based on outlays.</p>
 
 <h2>Key findings</h2>    
      <p><strong>The  total value of direct federal financial interventions and subsidies in energy  markets decreased nearly 25% between FYs 2010 and 2013, declining from $38.0  billion to $29.3 billion (see </strong>Table  ES1<strong> and </strong>Table  ES2<strong>)</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Conservation  and end-use subsidies (excluding LIHEAP) experienced a substantial decline in  both absolute and percentage terms between FY 2010 and FY 2013, declining from  $10.2 billion to $4.8 billion</strong> </strong>(see  Table  ES1).The decrease in subsidies and  support for these programs was led by declines in direct expenditures and tax  expenditures (see Table  ES2).  Of the $5.4-billion decline in support of conservation and end use between FY  2010 and FY 2013, the tax credit for energy efficiency improvements to existing  homes (26 U.S.C. 25C) accounted for $2.8 billion, with direct expenditures  supporting conservation subsidies decreasing $2.3 billion and having the  second-largest impact on the overall decline. This &lsquo;25C&rsquo; tax credit funded  investments in energy-efficient windows, furnaces, boilers, boiler fans, and  building envelope components.</p>

      <p><strong>Subsidies  for fuels used outside the electricity sector also experienced a substantial  decline in both absolute and percentage terms between FY 2010 and FY 2013,  driven mainly by the elimination of the Alcohol Fuel Exemption, also referred  to as the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC). </strong>In FY 2010, blends of ethanol and gasoline were  eligible for a credit of 45 cents per gallon of ethanol used to produce the  blend, resulting in a tax expenditure of nearly $6 billion. This program,  however, expired at the end of 2011.</p>
      <p><strong>Electricity-related  subsidies, primarily directed towards fuels and technologies used for  electricity production, increased in both absolute and percentage terms between  FY 2010 and FY 2013, reflecting increases in both direct expenditures and tax  subsidies. </strong>Outlays from Treasury's Energy Investment Grant  program (i.e., ARRA&rsquo;s Section 1603 grant program for renewable energy) increased  from $4.5 billion in FY 2010 to $8.2 billion in FY 2013, while  electricity-related tax expenditures for renewables doubled from $1.9 billion  to $3.8 billion.</p>
      <p><strong>Between  FY 2010 and FY 2013, the share of tax expenditure in total financial  interventions and subsidies declined while the share of direct expenditures  grew, driven mainly by the elimination of the alcohol fuel exemption on the one  hand and significant increases in outlays for ARRA Section 1603 grants for  electricity-related renewables on the other</strong>. Tax expenditures accounted for 42% ($12.4  billion) of the total value of direct federal financial interventions and  subsidies in energy markets in FY 2013, down from 46% ($17.3 billion) in FY  2010, as the share of direct expenditures increased from 39% ($14.8 billion) in  FY 2010 to 44% ($12.9 billion) in FY 2013.</p>
      <p><strong>The changing mix of direct expenditures  between FY 2010 and FY 2013 was primarily driven by ARRA's Section 1603 grant  program. </strong>Between FY 2010 and FY 2013, the renewable share of direct  expenditures increased from 37% to 65%, while the end-use technologies share  dropped from 41% to 27%. Total direct expenditures decreased 13% from $14.8  billion to $12.9 billion.</p>
      <strong>No new DOE loan guarantees were issued in FY 2013. </strong>The  subsidy cost of the loans issued in FY 2010 totaled $1.7 billion, but this cost  is assessed at the time the loan is issued, so there was no subsidy cost for FY  2013. However, there were still outstanding debts in FY 2013 for loans issued  in prior years (see Table  25).  While lending authority for the Section 1705  loan program had expired by 2013, budget authority remains for future lending  on the Section 1703 loan program.

Energy-specific tax expenditures associated with renewables were  allocated based on preliminary generation data. No hydropower generation was  assumed to be eligible for production tax credits (PTC). It was assumed all  investment tax credits were claimed by solar power plants. Municipal Solid  Waste (MSW) and open-loop biomass generation estimates used to calculate PTCs  were halved to represent the value of their PTC credit, relative to geothermal  and wind. Generation estimates used to calculate credits associated with the  PTC captured wind and geothermal plants that came online in 2004 and later, and  MSW and open-loop biomass plants that came online in 2006 and later.<br />

Overall  energy consumption was roughly 97 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in  both FY 2010 and FY 2013. Domestic energy production, however, rose 10% from 73.7  quadrillion Btu in FY 2010 to 81.1 quadrillion Btu in FY 2013 (see Table  ES3). Oil  and natural gas production increased 8 quadrillion Btu, with renewables used  for both electricity generation and transport increasing 1 quadrillion Btu. The  overall amount of federal subsidies and support provided by federal programs  within the scope of this report has declined even as total energy production  has increased. However, whether at the aggregate level or for individual fuels  or technologies, the amount of subsidy per unit of energy produced or consumed  does not necessarily provide insight into the current amount of energy  production, consumption, or conservation that is or has been supported or  influenced. For many programs, there is a disconnect between when the money is  spent and when the impacts are felt. For  example, many subsidies support capital investments, which may produce little  energy in their first year of service (possibly the year a subsidy is claimed),  but then produce energy for many years. Also, R&amp;D expenditures are not  reflected in the nation&rsquo;s energy mix unless and until they lead to innovations  that penetrate the market, which is a process that could take many years.</p>

      <h2>Findings regarding electricity-related subsidies and support</h2>
      <p><strong>Electricity-related subsidies  increased 38% between FY 2010 and FY 2013, from $11.7 billion to $16.1 billion </strong>(see  Table ES1).<strong> </strong>This increase was largely the result  of a $4.2 billion increase, from $1.1 billion in FY 2010 to $5.3 billion in FY  2013, in support of solar energy, reflecting a large increase in the  installation rate of solar facilities utilizing the ARRA Section 1603 grant  payments or the 30% Investment Tax Credit (see Table ES2  and Figure ES1). Total subsidies to wind energy also increased between FY 2010  and FY 2013, rising from $5.5 billion to $5.9 billion.</p>
      <strong>Wind energy received the largest share of direct  federal subsidies and support in FY 2013, accounting for 37% of total  electricity-related subsidies </strong><strong>(see </strong>Table  ES4<strong>)</strong>. Nearly three-fourths of FY 2013 wind energy subsidies  were direct expenditures and largely resulted from the ARRA Section 1603 grant program.<sup><a href="index.html#6">6</a>,<a href="index.html#7">7</a></sup> </p>

Electricity generating gross capacity additions by year." /></a></span></p>       <p><strong>Support for Smart Grid and  electricity transmission represented the largest portion of electricity-related  R&amp;D subsidies. </strong>Nearly 39% of FY 2013 R&amp;D expenditures  were devoted to researching the electricity grid&rsquo;s capability to accommodate  larger shares of electricity from intermittent sources (e.g., solar, wind, and other  renewable energy sources) and offer other potential benefits to producers and  consumers of electricity. In FY 2013, electricity-related R&amp;D support was $2.1  billion, or 13% of the electricity-related total value of direct federal  financial interventions and subsidies.</p>
      <p><strong>Electricity-related  renewables received a large share of direct federal subsidies and support in FY  2013 compared with their share of total electricity generation</strong>. Renewables (excluding biofuels) received 72%  of all electricity-related subsidies and support in FY 2013 (see Table ES3  and Table ES4 ), yet accounted for 13% of total generation in  calendar year 2013.<a href="index.html#8"><sup>8</sup></a> More than three-quarters  of the subsidies going to renewables were direct expenditures or tax  expenditures targeting upfront capital investments for projects expected to produce  energy for at least 20 years.</p>
      <p><strong>Interest rate support for federal electricity  programs did not increase from FY 2010 to FY 2013. </strong>While these programs expanded long-term debt by  financing more new generation and transmission projects, the increased debt was  offset by lower effective interest rates and more favorable spreads between 30-year  Treasury bonds and the cost of debt for IOUs in FY 2013 compared to FY 2010.      </p>

      <p><strong>Findings Regarding Subsidies and Support for Fuels Used Outside  of the Electricity Sector</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Renewable fuels received 65%  of the value of direct federal financial interventions and subsidies in energy  markets for fuels not used to produce electricity</strong><strong> (see </strong>Table ES6<strong>).  Subsidies and support for fuels used outside the electricity sector were $5.2  billion in FY 2013, which accounted for 18% of total subsidies and support. Of  that amount, the support for biofuels was</strong> $1.8 billion in FY  2013, driven mainly by tax expenditures, including the estimated tax  expenditure of $1.6 billion for the biodiesel producer tax credit. As noted  earlier, subsidies and support for biofuels have declined substantially since FY  2010, when the tax credits for ethanol-blended fuels that have since expired  were available.</p>
      <p><strong>Total subsidies for natural gas and petroleum  liquids declined 20% from $2.7 billion in FY 2010 to $2.2 billion in FY 2013 </strong><strong>(see  Table ES2). Support for natural gas and petroleum liquids is primarily based on  tax provisions of the IRC. </strong>Tax  expenditures related to the excess of percentage over cost depletion for wells  declined from $1 billion to $530 million between FY 2010 and FY 2013. However,  expensing of exploration and development costs rose from $422 million to $550  million over the same period, likely reflecting increased domestic drilling  activities.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:16px">Sources of Direct Expenditure and R&amp;D Expenditure Subsidy Data</h2>
        <p>For this report, EIA relies upon many of the  data sources and budget documents<a href="index.html#9"><sup>9</sup></a> used in EIA's prior subsidy reports to measure  the cost of programs to the federal budget. One significant enhancement is the  use of a comprehensive public database summarizing all federal budget obligations  that is available through <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/">USASpending.gov</a>.  For federal agencies other than DOE and Treasury, information on direct  expenditures and R&amp;D expenditures for FY 2010 and FY 2013 were extracted  from USASpending.gov. This extraction represents roughly 22% (or $3.5 billion)  of the $16.4 billion estimated as the combined direct and R&amp;D expenditures in  energy in FY 2013, whereas the remaining 78% of the total is estimated using  the same updated data sources used in EIA's prior subsidy report. DOE's direct  expenditure and R&amp;D expenditures are based on outlays, as provided by the  Office of the Chief Financial Officer at DOE. </p>
        <p><strong>Appropriations</strong>, <strong>obligations</strong>,  and <strong>outlays</strong> are the primary phases  of the United States government budget control system. Congress enacts  appropriations that provide federal agencies and programs budget authority to make  financial commitments (i.e., obligations) to spend funds. Obligations are legally  binding agreements to purchase items or services, which is the budget phase  captured in USASpending.gov. Outlays are payments made by the federal  government for services performed, and they offset or liquidate outstanding  obligations. </p>
        <p>Under steady state  conditions, where outlays follow obligations in a regular pattern and there are  no sharp discontinuities in the former or the latter, obligation and outlay  measures closely correspond. However, the enactment of ARRA included energy  funding that dwarfed DOE's previous energy program budgets and required the  rapid obligation of funds that would fund outlays over several years. Because  ARRA appropriations created a wide gap between budget authority, obligations,  and outlays, EIA faced a decision whether to tally spending based on  obligations or outlays. Given the multi-year outlays from a 20-year high in  budget authority created under ARRA, and the fact that both tax expenditures  and the Section 1603 grants that constitute the other major spending programs  considered in this study are reported in the year when the grant or credit is  claimed, EIA determined that users of the report would be best served by  reporting DOE programs based on outlays, using information obtained from DOE's  Office of the Chief Financial Officer. </p>
        <p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/images/figes2.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/images/figes2.jpg" width="340" alt="Figure ES2. Department of Energy budget authority and outlays, FYs 1980-13." /></a></span></p>
<p>EIA's budget research revealed that much of ARRA  funding was completely obligated by FY 2010; however, significant outlays that  fit the criteria of a subsidy in this report were made from ARRA-related  funding in fiscal years subsequent to FY 2010. Hence, the use of obligations in  the case of DOE would tend to distort subsidy trends and &quot;front-load&quot; the  estimates of direct and R&amp;D expenditures. ARRA included appropriations of  more than $45.2 billion to DOE<a href="index.html#10"><sup>10</sup></a> and a review of total appropriations, obligations and outlays appear in Figure ES2 to show the overall impact from ARRA-related funding on DOE.<a href="index.html#11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

          <p><sup><a name="6"></a>6</sup>In FY 2010, 84% of Section 1603 grant payments  went to wind energy; however, in FY 2013 this percentage dropped to 52%.</p>
  <p><sup><a name="7"></a>7</sup>Note that direct expenditures include grant  programs where all of the cost is assigned to the year in which a project  enters service. For many wind projects, the Section 1603 grant was used in lieu  of the production tax credit (PTC), which is paid out over the first 10 years  of a project's operation. Although the Section 1603 grant, which represents 30%  of the project&rsquo;s installed cost, and the PTC, providing an inflation-adjusted  value of approximately 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for energy sold, are  not necessarily equal, they are relatively comparable in present value terms.  The use of the Section 1603 grant results in &ldquo;front-loaded&rdquo; direct expenditure  for a project that might otherwise have claimed the PTC over a 10-year period.</p>
