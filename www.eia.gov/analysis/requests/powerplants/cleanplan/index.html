<h2 style="font-size:21px">Background, Methodology, and Scenarios</h2>
<p>This report responds to an August 2014 request to the U.S.  Energy Information Administration (EIA) from Representative Lamar Smith,  Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology, for an analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)  proposed Clean Power Plan under which states would be required to develop plans  to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions rates from existing  fossil-fired electricity generating units.<a href="index.html#1"><sup>1</sup></a> Appendix A  provides a copy of the request letter.</p>
<p>  The starting point for EIA&rsquo;s analysis of the Clean Power  Plan is the <em>Annual Energy Outlook 2015</em> (AEO2015) Reference case rather than earlier AEO projections that were  developed using versions of EIA's National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) that  lack the model structure needed to analyze key features of the Clean Power Plan  proposal. With EIA's decision, unrelated to this project, to publish shorter  and longer editions of the AEO in alternating years, AEO2015 does not include  all of the alternative cases presented in earlier AEO editions. However, in the  spirit of Chairman Smith&rsquo;s request, this report analyzes the Clean Power Plan  in the context of the AEO2015 High Economic Growth and High Oil and Gas  Resource cases as well as the Reference case in order to examine indicators of  the proposed rule&rsquo;s impacts on energy markets under varying assumptions  regarding economic growth, electricity demand, and fuel prices.</p>
<p>  To address some of the additional questions raised in  Chairman Smith's request, the report includes additional Clean Power Plan sensitivity  cases including: 1) extension of the Clean Power Plan targets beyond 2030 to reduce  CO2 emissions from electric power generation by 45% relative to the  2005 level by 2040; 2) treatment of future nuclear capacity similar to the  treatment of renewable capacity; 3) sensitivities for expenditures and  effectiveness of energy efficiency programs; 4) sensitivities for the cost and  effectiveness of heat rate improvement measures; 5) no availability of markets  for CO2 captured from electric power plants for enhanced oil  recovery (EOR); 6) an alternative compliance phase-in trajectory during the  2020-29 period; 7) alternative accounting rules for emissions from biomass  generation; 8) national compliance cooperation; and 9) limited interregional  trade.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:21px">Description  of the proposed Clean Power Plan</h2>
<h2><i>Rulemaking history and status</i></h2>
<p>In June 2014, EPA issued its proposed Clean  Power Plan to regulate CO2 emissions from existing power plants  under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.<a href="index.html#2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Clean Power Plan proposes to limit carbon emissions from existing fossil  fuel-fired electric generating units, including steam generating, integrated  gasification combined cycle, or stationary combustion turbines (in either  simple cycle or combined cycle
configuration) operating or under construction by January 8,  2014.<a href="index.html#3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
<p>  In addition to the text of the proposed rule, EPA issued a  Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Clean Power Plan,<a href="index.html#4"><sup>4</sup></a> along with numerous technical supporting documents and fact sheets.<a href="index.html#5"><sup>5</sup></a> In  October 2014, EPA issued a notice of data availability, which provided  discussion and solicited additional comment on several topic areas, including  the 2020-29 compliance trajectories.<a href="index.html#6"><sup>6</sup></a> Also in October 2014, EPA issued a supplemental proposal to address carbon  pollution from affected power plants in Indian Country and U.S. territories.<a href="index.html#7"><sup>7</sup></a> In  November 2014, EPA issued an additional technical support document providing  examples of how a state could translate its rate-based goal into an equivalent  mass-based goal, expressed in metric tons of CO2.<a href="index.html#8"><sup>8</sup></a> In  November 2014, EPA also issued a memo addressing biogenic CO2 emissions  from stationary sources that explicitly relates this topic to the implementation  of the Clean Power Plan.<a href="index.html#9"><sup>9</sup></a>
<h2><i>EPA's  proposed Best System of Emissions Reduction and state-level CO2  emission performance goals</i></h2>
<p>In the proposed Clean Power Plan, EPA calculates the emissions reduction targets for individual states through application of a Best System of Emissions Reduction (BSER). The BSER consists of four building blocks which represent approaches to reducing CO2 emissions rates from existing fossil fuel-fired generators as calculated for purposes of compliance: </p>
<blockquote>Building block 1: Improving the  thermal efficiency of individual affected sources (heat rate improvement)<a href="index.html#10"><sup>10</sup></a><br />
Building Block 2: Dispatching the  generating fleet to substitute less-carbon-intensive affected sources for more-carbon-intensive  affected sources (re-dispatch for reduced emissions)<br />
Building Block 3: Expanding the  use of low- or zero-carbon generation in order to displace affected sources  (low- and zero-carbon capacity expansion)<br />
Building Block 4: Employing the use of  demand-side energy efficiency to reduce overall generation required from  affected sources (demand-side energy efficiency)<a href="index.html#11"><sup>11</sup></a></blockquote>
<p>In determining state goals, EPA begins by calculating an affected  fossil generation emissions rate, in pounds of CO2 emissions per  megawatt hour of electricity generated, based on 2012 historical data for each  state. EPA then applies the building blocks of the BSER to arrive at each  state&rsquo;s interim and final emission rate performance goals. The Clean Power Plan  proposes that states begin to reduce CO2 emissions from affected  electric generating units by 2020 in order to reach final CO2  emission performance goals, measured in pounds of CO2 emitted per  megawatthour of electricity generated from affected electric generating units,  by 2030. The Clean Power Plan also  proposes that states meet interim CO2 emission performance goals, on  average, over the 10-year compliance period from 2020-29.<a href="index.html#12"><sup>12</sup></a> The  state-level emissions rates as calculated by EPA for 2012, as well as the  interim targets for 2020-29 and the final targets for 2030 and beyond,  specified in the proposed Clean Power Plan are provided in Appendix C,  Table 25.</p>
<p>It is critical to recognize that while the BSER building  blocks are used to establish state-level goals, each state has discretion in designing  implementation plans to achieve outcomes that meet the goals. Two or more  states may also cooperate to meet their combined goals jointly.</p>
<p>The state-level emissions performance goals  under the proposed Clean Power Plan are not based on a simple emission rate  calculation (emissions divided by generation) for generation provided by  existing fossil-fired electric generating units. Rather, the goals are  established and compliance is assessed using a formula that provides varying treatment  of specific generation sources and demand-side efficiency programs that can  displace CO2 emissions from existing generating units that are  regulated under the Clean Power Plan proposal. For example,  unlimited amounts of new and existing zero-emission non-hydropower renewable generation are included in the generation base used to calculate compliance, which  makes the non-hydropower renewable generation more valuable for compliance than  existing hydropower and new and existing nuclear generation that do not receive  similar treatment. The proposed Clean Power Plan formula also considers  efficiency programs that reduce load as equivalent to zero-emission generation  that counts in the base for the compliance calculation, even though some of the  generation that is avoided by reduced load may have already been served by  zero-emission generation sources.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:21px">Methodology</h2>
<h2><i>The National Energy Modeling System</i></h2>
<p>This report considers the proposed Clean Power Plan as  modeled using EIA's National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). NEMS is a modular  economic modeling system used by EIA to develop long-term projections of the  U.S. energy sector, currently through the year 2040.<a href="index.html#13"><sup>13</sup></a> </p>
  <p>The level of regional disaggregation in NEMS varies across  sectors. For example, Lower 48 states electricity markets are represented using  22 regions, coal production is represented by 14 regions, and oil and natural  gas production is represented in 9 regions. In many but not all cases, regional  boundaries follow state borders. To the extent possible, this analysis represents  the Clean Power Plan using regional targets derived from the state-level  targets in the EPA proposal.</p>
  <p>The Reference case projections developed in NEMS and  published in the <em>Annual Energy Outlook</em> <em>2015 </em>generally reflect federal laws  and regulations and state renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in effect at the  time of the projection. The Reference case does not assume the extension of  laws with sunset provisions. In keeping with the requirement that EIA remain policy-neutral,  the Reference case does not include proposed regulations such as the Clean  Power Plan.</p>
  <p>For this report, EIA constructed cases in NEMS that  represent compliance with the proposed Clean Power Plan, including:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>EPA's proposed carbon intensity targets during  the interim and final compliance periods, enforced at the NEMS Electricity  Market Module (EMM) region level</li>
  <li>Choice of heat rate improvements (HRI) based on  the representation of the cost and degree of potential HRI incorporated in the  current (AEO2015) version of NEMS<a href="index.html#14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>
  <li>Re-dispatch of affected electric generating  units as an available compliance strategy <strong></strong></li>
  <li>Credit in compliance calculations for generation  from existing and new renewable capacity<a href="index.html#15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
  <li>Credit in compliance calculations for currently  under-construction nuclear capacity and 6% of generation from existing nuclear  capacity<strong></strong></li>
  <li>Expansion of new low- and zero-carbon-emitting  generating capacity, including representation of state renewable portfolio  standards (RPS)<a href="index.html#16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
  <li>Credit in compliance calculations for avoided  generation as a result of incremental demand-side energy efficiency savings  achieved through energy efficiency measures in the residential and commercial  sectors <a href="index.html#17"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
  <li>A phased-in 2020-29 compliance trajectory, to  reflect that the proposed rule allows states flexibility to determine their  pre-2030 trajectory, if they meet interim targets on a 10-year average or  cumulative basis</li></ul>
  <p>By explicitly modeling the intensity targets, NEMS does not  require or assume specific levels for individual compliance strategies. The  discussion of EIA's analysis presents results in terms of the compliance  options used to meet the regionalized Clean Power Plan targets.</p>
  <h2><i>Regional groupings</i></h2>
  <p>As noted above, NEMS is not a state-level model. The  Electricity Market Module (EMM) builds and dispatches electric generating  capacity in twenty-two distinct geographic regions, as shown in Figure 1 and described in Table 1.<a href="index.html#18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

  <h2 style="font-size:21px">Caveats regarding interpretation of this analysis</h2>
  <p>Consistent with EIA&rsquo;s statutory mission and  expertise, this analysis focuses on the implications for the energy system and  the economy of reducing CO2 emissions under the proposed Clean Power  Plan. It does not consider any potential health or environmental benefits from  reducing CO2 emissions from existing electric generating units  covered by the proposed Clean Power Plan. It is not a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
  <p>Additionally, this analysis represents other laws and  regulations as modeled in NEMS. The Reference case used as the starting point for  this analysis is the <em>Annual Energy  Outlook 2015</em> (AEO2015) Reference case, which generally reflects laws and  regulations in effect as of October 2014.</p>
  <p>    EIA recognizes that projections over a 25-year horizon are  inherently uncertain and subject to changing policy objectives, supply  disruptions, the emergence of disruptive technologies, and other future  developments. It is not possible for EIA to account for all uncertainties; for  practical reasons this study examines a limited set of sensitivities through  alternative scenario analysis.</p>
Additionally, there is considerable uncertainty  and many challenges are involved in projecting the impacts of the proposed Clean  Power Plan.
<ul>
  <li>The Clean Power Plan is still a proposed rule as  of the date of this report; the final rule may differ from the proposed rule in  material ways.<strong></strong></li>
  <li>The regional compliance patterns presented in  this analysis are model outputs from NEMS, while actual compliance mechanisms  will be defined by state compliance proposals and may have different characteristics.<strong></strong></li>
  <li>The construction of new generation to comply  with the Clean Power Plan may necessitate upgrades to, and expansion of,  electric power transmission systems; however, NEMS does not include transfer  limits on intraregional power trade, nor does it contain a power-flow model or  assess the reliability of bulk power transmission systems in detail.</li>
  <li>NEMS does not consider how deliverability of  natural gas to power plants using that fuel might be impacted by extreme cold  conditions in regions where natural gas is a primary fuel for residential and  commercial heating and local natural gas distribution companies typically have  the first call on available firm natural gas transmission capacity.<strong></strong></li>
  <li>The modeled 2020-29 emission performance trajectory  was developed outside of NEMS, as an approach to represent the proposed rule's  flexibility within the existing NEMS framework.<a href="index.html#20"><sup>20</sup></a> <strong></strong></li>
  <li>Combustion turbines are not included in  compliance calculations based on the assumption that only a small percentage  would reach the output criteria proposed by EPA.</li>
  <li>NEMS does not model useful thermal output from power-sector  combined heat and power (CHP) plants; therefore, this analysis applies a  calculated average generation factor to power-sector CHP plants in NEMS in  order to represent the Clean Power Plan's provision to account for useful  thermal output from CHP.<a href="index.html#21"><sup>21</sup></a></li>

  <p><strong>Treatment of New Nuclear Generating Capacity under EPA's Proposed Clean Power Plan rule for Existing Electric Generating Units under Clean Air Act Section 111(d)</strong></p>
  <p>The proposed Clean Power Plan Rule under section 111(d) is complex and subject to varying interpretation even before consideration of decisions that will be made by states to implement the rule that is finally promulgated.  The treatment of new nuclear generation not already under construction illustrates the challenges in this area.    </p>
  <p>In developing its Base Policy case (CPP), EIA assumed that new nuclear generation beyond units already under construction would not receive the same treatment accorded under the rule to eligible renewable generation, which is counted in the denominator when calculating the average carbon dioxide intensity rate for generation from existing fossil-fuel units for compliance purposes.  However, EIA also considered an alternative case (CPPNUC) that accorded all new nuclear power the same treatment as new eligible renewables in the compliance calculation.    </p>
  <p>EIA's assumption regarding the treatment of new nuclear units beyond those already under construction in the Base Policy case (CPP) is consistent with its reading of:</p>
  <p>1) Language regarding the definition of &quot;new nuclear generating capacity&quot; from the proposed rule,<a href="index.html#22"><sup>22</sup></a> and</p>
  <p>2) The rate-setting criteria<a href="index.html#23"><sup>23</sup></a> in the technical support documentation accompanying the proposed rule. </p>
  <p>The proposed rule identifies new nuclear capacity as a potential source of carbon-free generation that can replace existing fossil-fueled power plants targeted under the program.   EPA focuses on what it regards as the two most promising sources of additional nuclear output: 1) plants currently under construction, and 2) preservation of existing plants that might otherwise be retired, 5.7 GW of capacity, or roughly 6% of the share of nuclear capacity termed &quot;at risk of retirement.&quot;  Generation from &quot;new&quot; nuclear plants not already under construction is not presented as affected generation (i.e., the denominator of the average CO2 intensity rate formula).  States could allow generation from new, not-under-construction plants to displace generation (and emissions) from existing coal or natural gas plants that were accounted for in the emission rate computation.  While this displacement would, presumably, help states meet their emission rate goal, the generation from these &quot;new&quot; plants would not be directly reflected in the base generation used to compute the goal.    </p>
  <p>EPA's  &quot;Goal Computation Technical Support Document&quot; (TSD) accompanying the Federal  Register Notice allows generation from &quot;under construction&quot; and &ldquo;at risk [of  retirement]&rdquo; nuclear plants to count against the affected generation (in the  denominator, as indicated in the equation below) used to compute the emission  rate goals for each state.<a href="index.html#24"><sup>24</sup></a> <br />
  </p>

 <img src="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/powerplants/cleanplan/images/equation.png" width="550" alt="Equation" style="padding-right:50px"/><br /><br />
  
    <p>While these sections are relatively clear in  describing how generation from nuclear plants is accounted for in the emission  rate goals, other parts of the EPA proposal suggest the possibility that &ldquo;new&rdquo;  nuclear plants beyond those currently under construction may play a role in  state compliance planning. For example,  in the proposal, EPA explicitly asks for comment on &quot;whether we [EPA] should  include in the
    state  goals an estimated amount of additional nuclear capacity whose construction is  sufficiently likely to merit evaluation for potential inclusion in the  goal-setting computation.&quot;<a href="index.html#24"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
    <p>EIA's CPPNUC case reflects the possibility that  generation from new nuclear capacity beyond units already under construction  could be counted in the denominator of the compliance formula for existing  fossil generation units. This case,  which is featured prominently among the alternative scenarios in EIA's  analysis, reflects only one of many uncertainties in the ultimate specification  of the rule that EIA evaluated.</p>

    <p><strong>FIGURES IN THIS REPORT</strong>:</p>
    <p>This report includes two primary figure styles. Difference-type  figures, such as Figure 3 below, focus on the change in a specific year or over  a specific time period between Clean Power Plan cases and the baseline cases from  which they are developed. </p>
<p>Time-trend figures, such as Figure 9 below,  present base and policy case information starting from the historical year 2005  through 2040, the end of the AEO2015 projection period. Nearly all time-trend  figures in this report have two panels. The left-hand panel reports the AEO  Reference case (black line) together with several Clean Power Plan cases  developed from that baseline. The right-hand  panel reports two alternative baselines, High Economic Growth and High Oil and  Gas Resources, along with one Clean Power Plan case developed from each respective  baseline. Each baseline and its associated policy case in the right-hand panel  use the same color (darker for the former, lighter for the latter) to help  readers identify which lines should be compared to identify changes resulting  from the Clean Power Plan.</p></div>
  <h2 style="font-size:21px">Summary of Results</h2>
  <p>Power sector CO2 emissions declined by 363 million  metric tons between 2005 and 2013, due to a decline in coal&rsquo;s generation share  and growing use of natural gas and renewables, but the CO2 emissions  are projected to change only modestly from 2013 through 2040 in the 3 baseline  cases used in this report. Relative to the AEO2015 Reference case, the  projected emissions trajectory is somewhat lower in the High Oil and Gas  Resource case baseline, which has cheaper natural gas, and somewhat higher in  the High Economic Growth case, which has higher electricity use.</p>
  <p><strong>The  proposed Clean Power Plan would reduce projected power sector CO2  emissions (Figure 3, <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/powerplants/cleanplan/pdf/table3.pdf">Table 3</a> and <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/powerplants/cleanplan/pdf/table4.pdf">Table 4</a>). </strong>Reductions  in projected emissions in 2030 relative to baseline projections for that year  range from 484 to 625 million metric tons. The projected power sector emissions  level in 2030 ranges from 1,553 to 1,727 million metric tons across the cases,  reflecting a reduction of between 29% and 36% relative to the 2005 emissions  level of 2,416 million metric tons.</p>

  <p><strong>Switching from coal-fired generation to natural  gas-fired generation is the predominant compliance strategy as implementation  begins, with renewables playing a growing role in the mid-2020s and beyond (Figures  4 and 5; Tables 3 and 4).</strong> Demand-side energy efficiency plays a moderate role in compliance, relative to  the early role of natural gas and the eventual role of renewables. The  economics of increased natural gas generation and expanded renewable  electricity capacity vary regionally, the key determinants being: 1) the natural  gas supply and combined cycle utilization rates by region; and 2) the potential  for penetration of renewable generation in regions including states that have  no (or low) renewable portfolio standards.  </p>

  <p><strong>With continued Clean Power Plan emissions reduction  requirements through 2040 under the Policy Extension Case (CPPEXT), the shift  to higher natural gas-fired generation is maintained through 2030-35 (Figure 5  and Table 3).</strong></p>

  <p><strong>If new nuclear power generation were to be treated  in the same manner as new renewable generation in compliance calculations, the  Clean Power Plan would also result in increased nuclear generation (Figure 6  and Table 3).</strong></p>
  <p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/powerplants/cleanplan/images/figure6.png" class="lightbox">

  <p><strong>The Clean Power Plan has a significant effect on  projected retirements and additions of electric generation capacity (Figures 7  and 8; Tables 3 and 4). </strong>Projected  coal plant retirements over the 2014-40 period, which are 40 GW in the AEO2015  Reference case (most before 2017), increase to 90 GW (nearly all by 2020) in  the Base Policy case (CPP). Retirements of inefficient units fueled by natural  gas or oil, generally involving primary steam cycles, are also projected to  rise. Turning to additions, which are dominated by natural gas and renewables  over the 2014-40 period in the AEO2015 Reference case, the Clean Power Plan  significantly increases projected renewable capacity additions in all cases. Under  favorable natural gas supply conditions, the Clean Power Plan also increases  additions of generation capacity fueled by natural gas (CPPHOGR). Nuclear  capacity is also added in a sensitivity case in which new nuclear generation  receives the same treatment as new renewable generation in compliance calculations  (CPPNUC).</p>

  <p><strong>Coal production and minemouth steam coal prices  are lower compared with the AEO2015 Reference case in the early years following  Clean Power Plan implementation (Figures 9 and 10, and Tables 3 and 4).</strong> In the Base Policy case (CPP) projected U.S.  coal production in 2020 and 2025 is 20% and 32% lower relative to the AEO2015  baseline level in those years, respectively. All major coal-producing regions  (West, Interior, and Appalachia) experience negative production impacts in  2020. Expanded generation from renewables, rising natural gas prices, and  static CPP targets in the post-2030 period in the CPP case allow existing coal-fired  plants to operate at a higher utilization rate which rises from a low of 60% in  2024 to 71% in 2040. As a result, coal production edges higher but still  remains 20% below the AEO2015 Reference case level in 2040. The Interior coal-producing  region, which primarily includes the Illinois and Gulf-lignite Basins, and the West  coal-producing region, which primarily includes the Powder River, Rocky  Mountain, Arizona/New Mexico and Dakota-lignite Basins, account for most of the  increase in production levels in the CPP case towards the end of the projection  period. Average minemouth steam coal prices also decline after 2020 and are 8%  and 10% lower in 2025 and 2030, respectively in the Base Policy Case compared with  the AEO2015 Reference case and then remain at least 8% lower than the Reference  case through 2040.</p>

    <br />
    <strong>The Clean Power Plan&rsquo;s effect on natural gas production  and prices is very sensitive to baseline supply conditions (Figure 11 and Figure  12; Tables 3 and 4). </strong>The Clean Power Plan increases natural gas use  significantly relative to baseline at the start of Clean Power Plan  implementation, but this effect fades over time as renewables and efficiency  programs increasingly become the dominant compliance strategies. While there  are significant differences in projected natural gas prices across baselines,  with persistently lower prices in the High Oil and Gas Resource case, the Clean  Power plan itself does not significantly move natural gas prices with the  exception of an initial impact expected during the first 2-3 years after the  start of implementation.</p>

    <p><strong>Heat rates for coal-fired generators that remain  in use, defined as the energy content of coal consumed (in Btu) per kWh of net electricity  generated, improve modestly under the Clean Power Plan (Figure 13).</strong> In all cases, the average heat rate improvement  across the fleet of coal-fired generators is less than 2%. The projected level  of heat rate improvement is sensitive to assumptions about natural gas supply  that influence natural gas prices, reflecting competition between available  compliance options.

    <p><strong>Retail electricity prices and expenditures rise  under the Clean Power Plan.</strong> Retail electricity prices increase most in the early 2020s, in response to  initial compliance measures. Increased investment in new generating capacity as  well as increased use of natural gas for generation lead to electricity prices  that are 3% to 7% higher on average from 2020-25 in the Clean Power Plan cases,  versus the respective baseline cases (Figure 14).  While prices return to near-baseline levels by 2030 in many regions, prices  remain at elevated levels in some parts of the country. In Florida and the  Southeast, the Southern Plains, and the Southwest regions the projected  electricity prices in 2030 are roughly 10% above baseline in the Base Policy  case (CPP). Electricity expenditures also generally rise with Clean Power Plan  implementation, but expenditure changes are smaller in percentage terms than  price changes as the combination of energy-efficiency programs pursued for  compliance purposes and higher electricity prices tends to reduce electricity  consumption relative to baseline. By 2040, total electricity expenditures in  the CPP case are slightly below those in the AEO2015 Reference case, as  decreases in demand more than offset the price increases.

    <p>Biomass  generation accounts for only a small share of total generation with or without  the Clean Power Plan. Implementation of the Clean Power Plan can either  increase or decrease projected biomass generation depending on the emission rate  applied to biomass generation in the compliance calculation. Using the 195  pounds/MMBtu emissions rate for biomass assumed in EPA&rsquo;s Regulatory Impact  Analysis, as in the CPPBIO195 case, EIA projects that biomass generation in  2020 and 2030 would be 33% and 71% below the respective AEO2015 baseline levels  of 24 billion kWh (BkWh) and 41 BkWh for those years. In the Base Policy case (CPP),  which uses the standard EIA treatment of biomass generation as a net zero  emissions generation source, EIA projects that biomass generation in 2020 and  2030 would be 46% above and 5% below the respective AEO2015 baseline levels for  those years.     
    <p><strong>Economic  activity indicators, including real gross domestic product (GDP), industrial  shipments, and consumption, are reduced relative to baseline under the Clean  Power Plan. Across cases that start from the AEO2015 Reference case, the  reduction in cumulative GDP over 2015-40 ranges from 0.17%-0.25%, with the high  end reflecting a tighter policy beyond 2030. </strong>Implementing the Clean Power Plan under baselines that assume  high economic growth or high oil and gas resources ameliorate both GDP and  disposable income impacts relative to outcomes using the AEO2015 Reference case  baseline.</p>

The alternative option would require that states meet final  emission performance levels by 2025, with interim goals met over the period  from 2020-2024.
