      <p class="report_bold">Results</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">In the <em>AEO2008</em> reference case, U.S. conventional crude oil production grows from 5.1 million  barrels per day in 2006 to a peak of 6.3 million barrels per day in 2018, and  then declines to 5.6 million barrels per day in 2030 (Figure 2 and Table 2).&nbsp; The shape of the U.S. production profile is largely  driven by lower-48 offshore oil production, which rises from 1.4 million  barrels per day in 2006 to 2.4 million barrels per day in 2015, and then falls  to 1.9 million barrels per day in 2030.&nbsp;  Lower-48 onshore oil production grows slightly through 2030 because high  crude oil prices stimulate the growth in carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery  (EOR) production, which offsets the decline in the other lower-48 onshore oil  production.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">In the <em>AEO2008</em> reference case, Alaska  crude oil production (without ANWR) declines from 741,000 barrels per day in  2006 to about 520,000 barrels per day in 2014.&nbsp;  After 2014, Alaska  oil production increases due to the discovery and development of new offshore  oil fields that are expected to be found off the Alaska North Slope.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp; These new fields raise Alaska oil production to about 700,000  barrels per day in 2020.&nbsp; After 2020, Alaska oil production  declines to about 300,000 barrels per day in 2030.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">In all three ANWR resource cases, ANWR crude oil production  begins in 2018 and grows during most of the projection period before production  begins to decline.&nbsp; In the mean oil  resource case, ANWR oil production peaks at 780,000 barrels per day in  2027.&nbsp; The low- resource-case production  peaks at 510,000 barrels per day in 2028, while the high- resource-case  production peaks at 1,450,000 barrels per day in 2028.&nbsp; Cumulative oil production resulting from the  opening of ANWR from 2018 through 2030 amounts to 2.6 billion barrels in the  mean resource case, 1.9 billion barrels in the low resource case, and 4.3  billion barrels in the high resource case.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The opening of ANWR to oil and gas development includes the  following impacts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="report_peggy">reducing       world oil prices,</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">reducing       the U.S.       dependence on imported foreign oil,</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">improving       the U.S.       balance of trade,</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">extending       the life of&nbsp; TAPS for oil, and</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">increasing       U.S.       jobs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="report_peggy">The remainder of this section will focus primarily on  the first four impacts, because the employment impacts are difficult to  determine for oil fields being developed on the Alaska North Slope.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">With respect to the world oil price impact, projected ANWR  oil production constitutes between 0.4 and 1.2 percent of total world oil  consumption in 2030, based on the low and high resource cases, respectively.<sup>17</sup> Consequently, ANWR oil production is not  projected to have a large impact on world oil prices.&nbsp; Relative to the <em>AEO2008</em> reference case, ANWR oil production is projected to have its  largest oil price reduction impacts as follows: a reduction in low-sulfur,  light (LSL) crude oil<sup>18</sup> prices of $0.41 per barrel (2006 dollars) in 2026 in the low oil resource case,  $0.75 per barrel in 2025 in the mean oil resource case, and $1.44 per barrel in  2027 in the high oil resource case.&nbsp;  Assuming that world oil markets continue to work as they do today, the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could neutralize any  potential price impact of ANWR oil production by reducing its oil exports by an  equal amount.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">High oil prices and high Corporate Average Fuel Economy  (CAFE) standards are projected to restrain the growth in future U.S.  liquid fuels consumption.&nbsp; In the <em>AEO2008</em> reference case, total U.S.  liquid fuels consumption grows slowly from 20.7 million barrels per day in 2006  to 22.8 million barrels per day in 2030.&nbsp;  Lower projected U.S. liquid fuels consumption results in ANWR oil  production causing a larger percentage reduction in future oil and liquid  product imports than was the case in prior ANWR analyses conducted by EIA.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">Every barrel of ANWR oil production reduces crude oil  imports by about a barrel (Figure 3 and Table 2).&nbsp; In the <em>AEO2008</em> reference case, the proportion of crude oil and liquid fuel imports to total  supply remains relatively constant during the 2018 through 2025 time period at  an average value of 51 percent.&nbsp; After  2025, reference case oil dependency increases to about 54 percent of U.S.  liquid fuels supply in 2030.&nbsp; Because U.S.  liquid fuels consumption grows slowly during the entire projection period, the  lowest import dependency levels occur between 2022 and 2026 across the three  resource cases.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp; The mean oil resource case projects a minimum  import share of 48 percent in 2024, before rising to 51 percent in 2030.&nbsp; The low and high resource cases project  minimum import shares of 49 and 46 percent in 2022 and 2026, respectively.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The reduction in oil import volumes also reduces the level  of expenditures on crude oil and liquid fuel imports (Figure 4 and Table 2).&nbsp; In the <em>AEO2008 </em>reference case, high  projected oil prices cause cumulative net U.S. expenditures on imported oil  and liquid fuels to cost about $2.9 trillion (2006 dollars) between 2018 and  2030.&nbsp; The mean oil resource case reduces  this import expenditure by $202 billion dollars, or about 7 percent.&nbsp; In the low and high resource cases, ANWR oil  production reduces cumulative net expenditures on imported crude oil and liquid  fuels by about $135 to $327 billion (2006 dollars), respectively.&nbsp; As a result, the opening of ANWR to Federal  oil and natural gas leasing improves the U.S. balance of trade by $135 to  $327 billion during the 2018 through 2030 timeframe, based on the world oil  prices projected in the <em>AEO2008 </em>reference case.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The development of ANWR oil resources potentially  extends the lifetime operation of TAPS.&nbsp;  Currently, TAPS is believed to be uneconomic to operate once the oil  throughput falls below 200,000 barrels per day.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp; Although the reference case projects North Slope production to be above this minimum level, at  about 280,000 barrels per day in 2030, the development of ANWR oil resources  extends the life of this pipeline well beyond 2030.&nbsp; Greater TAPS throughput also reduces oil  transportation rates, thereby prolonging the life of existing oil fields and  encouraging the development of new, small North Slope  oil fields.</p>
      <p class="report_bold">ANWR Production Uncertainties</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">There is much uncertainty regarding the impact of opening  ANWR on U.S.  oil production and imports, due to several factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="report_peggy"><em>The size of the underlying resource       base</em>.&nbsp; There is little direct       knowledge regarding the petroleum geology of the ANWR region.&nbsp; The USGS oil resource estimates are       based largely on the oil productivity of geologic formations that exist in       the neighboring State lands and which continue into ANWR.&nbsp; Consequently, there is considerable       uncertainty regarding both the size and quality of the oil resources that       exist in ANWR.&nbsp; Thus, the potential       ultimate oil recovery and potential yearly production are highly       uncertain.</li>
        <li class="report_peggy"><em>Oil field sizes</em>. The size of the       oil fields found in ANWR is one factor that will determine the rate at       which ANWR oil resources are developed and produced.&nbsp; If the reservoirs are larger than       expected, then production would be greater in the 2018 through 2025       timeframe.&nbsp; Similarly, if the       reservoirs are smaller than expected, then production would be less.</li>
        <li class="report_peggy"><em>The quality of the oil and the       characteristics of the oil reservoirs</em>.&nbsp;       Oil field production rates are also determined by the quality of       oil found, e.g., viscosity and paraffin content, and the field&rsquo;s reservoir       characteristics, i.e., its depth, permeability, faulting, and water       saturation.&nbsp; This analysis assumes       oil quality and reservoir characteristics similar to those associated with       the Prudhoe Bay field.&nbsp; If, for example, the oil discovered in       ANWR has a considerably higher viscosity than the Prudhoe        Bay field oil, e.g., over 10,000 centipoise, then oil production       rates would be lower than projected in this analysis.</li>
        <li class="report_peggy"><em>Environmental considerations.</em> Environmental restrictions could affect access for exploration and development.&nbsp; Also, legal challenges to the BLM&rsquo;s       leasing program and to its approval of seismic data collection and of       specific oil field projects could significantly delay ANWR oil development       and production. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="report_peggy">Although there is  considerable uncertainty regarding future ANWR oil production, the current  upper limit to ANWR oil production is the transportation capacity of TAPS.&nbsp; TAPS has maximum  throughput capacity of 2.136 million barrels per day. <sup>21</sup>&nbsp; The high ANWR oil resource case comes closest  to reaching this pipeline capacity, when total North Slope  oil production peaks at 1.9 million barrels per day in 2026.</p>
