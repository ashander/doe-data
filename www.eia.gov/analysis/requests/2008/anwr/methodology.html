      <p class="report_bold">Methodology  and Assumptions</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The  effects of opening the coastal plain area of ANWR were determined by incorporating  the ANWR region into the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS).<sup>5</sup> The key assumptions required to project crude oil production from the coastal  plain of ANWR include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="report_peggy">timing of first production,</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">timing of continuing       development,</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">field size distributions,</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">production profiles, and</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">current oil market       conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="report_bold">Timing of First Production</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">At the present time, there  has been no crude oil production in the ANWR coastal plain region. This  analysis assumes that enactment of the legislation in 2008 would result in  first production from the ANWR area in 10 years, i.e., 2018.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The primary constraints to a rapid development of ANWR oil  resources are the limited weather &ldquo;windows&rdquo; for collecting seismic data and  drilling wells (a 3-to-4 month winter window) and for ocean barging of heavy  infrastructure equipment to the well site (a 2-to-3 month summer window).</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The assumption that ANWR oil production would begin 10 years  after legislation approves the Federal oil and natural gas leasing in the 1002  Area is based on the following 8-to-12 year timeline:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="report_peggy">2 to 3 years to obtain leases, including the development of a U.S.       Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leasing program, which includes approval       of an Environmental Impact Statement, the collection and analysis of seismic       data, and the auction and award of leases.</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">2 to 3 years to drill a single exploratory well. Exploratory wells       are slower to drill because geophysical data are collected during       drilling, e.g., rock cores and well logs.&nbsp;       Typically, Alaska North Slope exploration wells take two full       winter seasons to reach the desired depth.</li>
        <li class="report_peggy">1 to 2 years to develop a production development plan and obtain       BLM approval for that plan, if a commercial oil reservoir is       discovered.&nbsp; Considerably more time       could be required if the discovered oil reservoir is very deep, is filled       with heavy oil, or is highly faulted.&nbsp;       The petroleum company might have to collect more seismic data or       drill delineation wells to confirm that the deposit is commercial. </li>
        <li class="report_peggy">3 to 4 years to construct the feeder pipelines; to fabricate oil       separation and treatment plants, and transport them up from the lower-48       States to the North Slope by ocean barge; construct drilling pads; drill       to depth; and complete the wells. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="report_peggy">The 10-year timeline for developing ANWR petroleum resources  assumes that there is no protracted legal battle in approving the BLM&rsquo;s draft  Environmental Impact Statement, the BLM&rsquo;s approval to collect seismic data, or  the BLM&rsquo;s approval of a specific lease-development proposal.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The Alaska North Slope Badami and Alpine oil fields  are recent examples of how long it might take to develop new ANWR oil  fields.&nbsp; Located near the western border  of ANWR, on State lands, the Badami field was discovered in 1990 and went into  production in 1998, thereby taking 8 years between the oil discovery and  initial production.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; On the western border of the State
        lands, near the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the  Alpine field was discovered in 1994 and initial oil production occurred in  2000, thereby taking 6 years from discovery.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; These Alaska North Slope oil field  development time delays do not include the time delays associated with BLM  leasing, the collection and interpretation of seismic data, and the drilling of  exploratory wells.</p>
      <p class="report_bold">Timing of Continuing Development</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">This analysis assumes  that much of the oil resources in ANWR, like the other oil resources on Alaska's North Slope,  could be profitably developed given the current levels of technology and at  current and projected oil prices. This analysis also assumes that new  fields in ANWR will begin development 2 years after a prior ANWR field begins  oil production.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The decision to use a 2-year time lag in bringing ANWR fields into production is driven by four  factors. First, there is the large expected size of the ANWR fields, which  complicates the logistical problems associated with their development.&nbsp; Second, there is considerable investment  infrastructure required both to begin production in these fields and to link  these fields to the TransAlaska Pipeline System (TAPS). Third, there is  competition in investment and drilling resources from other domestic and  foreign projects, which potentially limits the resources available for ANWR  development. Finally, increasing the rate of ANWR development might also require  an expansion of TAPS throughput capacity.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">This study does not  assume that the expected rate of technological change in the oil and natural  gas industry will affect the rate of development of ANWR. While a higher rate  of technological development might reduce costs and lead to more efficient  development of ANWR resources, the primary impediment to the development of  ANWR resources is the current legal restriction that precludes access to these  oil resources.</p>
      <p class="report_bold">Field Size Distributions</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The current analysis uses the USGS assessment of  potential field sizes in the coastal plain area, based on its assessment of the  underlying geology.&nbsp; For the purposes of  evaluating the impact of opening ANWR for U.S. markets, EIA assumed that  State and Native lands within the coastal plain of ANWR would be opened for  development.&nbsp; In the mean oil resource  case, the total volume of technically recoverable crude oil projected to be  found within the coastal plain area is 10.4 billion barrels, compared to 5.7  billion barrels for the 95-percent probability estimate, and 16.0 billion  barrels for the 5-percent probability estimate.&nbsp;  Because the USGS 5-percent and 95-percent probability oil resource  estimates are asymmetric around the mean estimate, the expected field size  distribution and, in turn, the distribution of projected oil production are  also asymmetric with respect to the mean estimate&rsquo;s field sizes and projected  production.</p>

        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/tbl1.jpg" alt="Table 1. Oil Field Sizes and Their Date of Initial Production for the Three ANWR Resource Cases (milliion barrels).  Need help, contact the National Energy Information Center at 202-586-8800." width="355" height="172"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="report_peggy">In the mean oil resource case, the largest projected field  in ANWR is nearly 1.4 billion barrels. While considerably smaller than the  13.5-billion-barrel Prudhoe Bay field,<sup>8</sup> this would be larger than any new domestic onshore field brought into  production in decades. Subsequent fields, which are developed through 2030 in  the mean resource case, are expected to be smaller, with two additional fields  each with 700 million barrels of oil and four additional fields each with 360  million barrels of oil (Table 1).&nbsp; To put  these field sizes in context with recent North Slope Alaska oil discoveries, the Alpine Oil  field, the largest field to start producing in recent years, is estimated to  have 540 million barrels of ultimate recovery.<sup>9</sup></p>
      <p class="report_peggy">Because the larger fields are generally easier to find  and cheaper to develop, EIA&rsquo;s analysis assumes that the largest oil fields are  developed first.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">Because the USGS  assessment of ANWR oil resources has not changed since 2001, the ANWR field  sizes used in this analysis are the same as those used in EIA&rsquo;s 2004 ANWR  analysis.</p>
      <p class="report_bold">Production Profiles</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">Potential production from ANWR fields is based on the  size of the field discovered and the production profiles of other fields of the  same size in Alaska  with similar geological characteristics.&nbsp;  In general, fields are assumed to take 3 to 4 years to reach peak  production, maintain peak production for 3 to 4 years, and then decline  until they are no longer profitable and are closed.&nbsp; Identical production profiles were used in  the prior EIA report.</p>
      <p class="report_bold">Current Oil Market Conditions</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">Alaska North Slope crude oil  prices have increased dramatically, rising from $23.62 per barrel in 2000 to  $47.05 per barrel in 2005, a 99 percent increase, and to $63.69 in 2007, a 170  percent increase.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; Alaska North Slope oil prices have continued  to increase in 2008, in line with other crude prices.&nbsp; The price of West Texas Intermediate crude  oil, which typically has a price premium of $5 to $8 per barrel over Alaska  North Slope crude, has recently exceeded $120 per barrel.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">Considered in isolation, higher prices alone might raise an  expectation of higher ultimate recovery from whatever oil resource exists in  place.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; Higher prices can motivate efforts to  increase the recovery factor through more intensive drilling and through the  application of advanced techniques to increase recovery factors.&nbsp; While the menu of available methods may in  some cases be limited by the features of the Alaska North Slope environment,  for example, steam-injection enhanced oil recovery of the near-surface West Sak heavy oil deposits could endanger the  permafrost, some techniques would likely still be suitable.&nbsp; Higher prices also make it more attractive to  go after very small fields that are in close proximity to the larger fields  that are presumed to be the initial development targets.&nbsp; However, as discussed below, the main impact  of such approaches on the amount of oil actually recovered from ANWR is likely  to occur after 2030, the current time horizon for EIA analyses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="report_peggy">As previously noted, there is a strong incentive for  serial development of the ANWR resource, starting with the largest fields  first.&nbsp; As shown in Table 1, the expected  size of fields developed in each year through 2030 declines over time.&nbsp; Based on the field size distributions  provided for USGS for each of the resource cases, the expected target field in  2030 is estimated to contain 180 million barrels of recoverable oil in the low  (most unfavorable) resource case and even more oil in the other two resource  cases.&nbsp; Based on recent development  practice, oil fields smaller than 10 million barrels of recoverable oil that  lie in close proximity to existing developed fields in Alaska were deemed  desirable development targets even when crude oil prices were substantially  below their current level.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; Oil fields of 180 million barrels in  proximity to even larger developed fields within ANWR are likely to present  attractive development opportunities even at prices well below today&rsquo;s  level.&nbsp; Crude oil prices could be a  significant factor in determining whether much smaller fields within ANWR would  also be attractive to develop.&nbsp; However,
decisions regarding such smaller fields would most likely be  taken sometime after 2030, affecting production levels only after such fields  are actually brought on line.</p>       
      <p class="report_peggy">A similar timing issue arises with respect to the  application of advanced techniques to raise ultimate recovery factors in fields  of various sizes.&nbsp; With all new fields  already assumed to be developed in an efficient manner if ANWR resources are  opened to leasing and development, investments in such techniques would  predominantly occur well after fields are first developed.&nbsp; While prices can influence decisions  regarding the application of advanced techniques, the timing of ANWR  development is such that the major impact on production from large fields in  ANWR is not likely to be felt before 2030.&nbsp;  However, a more significant impact could be realized in later  years.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">The increase in drilling costs over time is another  important consideration that mitigates against an immediate impact of higher  oil prices on the production profile following initial development in a  scenario where ANWR resources are open to leasing and development.&nbsp; For example, the American Petroleum  Institute&rsquo;s (API) <em>Joint Association  Survey of Drilling Costs</em> (JAS) reports, that for the 10,000 to 12,499-foot  well-depth interval, the average cost of drilling a domestic<sup>13</sup> onshore oil well increased from $111 per foot-drilled in 2000 to $294 per  foot-drilled in 2005, a 165-percent cost increase.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp; For the same well-depth interval, Alaska onshore oil well  drilling costs increased from $283 per foot-drilled in 2000 to $1,880 per  foot-drilled in 2005, a 564-percent cost increase.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp; The vast majority of the oil wells drilled in  Alaska occur on the North   Slope.</p>
      <p class="report_peggy">These API well drilling cost averages illustrate two aspects  of Alaska North Slope oil field development costs.&nbsp; First, Alaska  oil fields have always been more expensive to develop than lower-48 oil fields  due to the North Slope&rsquo;s remote location,  harsh winters, and the environmental requirement to maintain the permafrost  layer.&nbsp; Second, in the current market  environment, where producers are completing for scarce oil field equipment,  drilling rigs, and skilled labor, the remoteness of the Alaska North Slope and  its limited drilling season works to its detriment, causing oil field  development costs to increase more than that witnessed in the lower-48.&nbsp; In the lower-48, a drilling company might  move a land rig only a couple of miles, or at most, a couple of hundred miles  to another drilling site.&nbsp; In contrast,  the deployment of new rigs to the Alaska North Slope requires that they be  transported many thousands of miles without any option for quick redeployment.</p>
     <p class="report_peggy"> Over the long-term, both lower-48 and Alaska North  Slope oil field development costs are expected to subside as the supply of  drilling rigs, oil field equipment, and skilled labor increases to catch up  with demand.&nbsp; However, it is unlikely  that Alaska North Slope oil field development costs will decline to year 2000  levels.</p>
     <p class="report_peggy">In summary, the basic intuition that higher  crude oil prices would likely result in higher ultimate recovery from whatever  resource exists in place is sound.&nbsp;  However, given the timing and cost considerations outlined above, EIA  does not expect the recent increase in oil prices to affect the projected  profile of ANWR development and production activities prior to 2030, the end of  the time horizon for this analysis.&nbsp;  Therefore, this current analysis of projected production from ANWR  through 2030 parallels our prior recent analyses of this topic that have used  similar or identical information on ANWR resources notwithstanding the recent  run-up in world crude oil prices.</p>
