  <p align="left"><strong>Weekly Data on U.S. Crude Oil Imports</strong><br>
  Recently, there has been a lot of interest regarding the origins of U.S. crude 
  oil imports. Disruptions in crude oil production in Venezuela, Nigeria, and 
  Iraq have focused attention on U.S. imports from these countries, while reports 
  of Saudi Arabia dramatically increasing production has generated interest in 
  U.S. imports from that country as well. While EIA&#8217;s weekly survey on crude 
  oil imports includes a section asking for the source of the imports, the sample 
  of respondents was not selected to provide statistically complete coverage. 
  In addition, there are some respondents each week that, while listing their 
  total crude oil imports for the week, neglect to list the country of origin. 
  Thus, EIA considers these data to be not accurate enough to publish actual country 
  specific volumes. However, in comparing this information to our final monthly 
  data, we do feel that the information contained in the weekly survey is sufficient 
  to give us a qualitative feel for the origins of U.S. crude oil imports. Therefore, 
  occasionally, EIA has made qualitative statements on the origins of crude oil 
  imports in our Weekly Highlights, which are included in our weekly data release, 
  as well as in<em> This Week In Petroleum.</em></p>

<p>But some analysts have &#8220;over-interpreted&#8221; this data in our opinion. 
  One problem associated with weekly import data in general, is that the timing 
  of a shipment can significantly impact the data from one week to another. A 
  large tanker arriving just before the week ends will inflate that week&#8217;s 
  volume, while reducing the following week&#8217;s volume. This is the nature 
  of weekly import data. But that general problem aside, as an example of some 
  analysts &#8220;over-interpreting&#8221; the country-level import volume data, 
  we have recently stated how crude oil imports from Venezuela have been &#8220;close 
  to&#8221; normal levels, or as described in the week&#8217;s Weekly Highlights, 
  as &#8220;averaging a little below pre-strike levels.&#8221; Some analysts have 
  then made two leaps of logic that are not necessarily supported. First, many 
  have assumed that our statements about U.S. crude oil imports from Venezuela 
  mean that total Venezuelan exports are &#8220;close to normal.&#8221; Then they 
  make the second leap by stating that this means that Venezuelan crude oil production 
  is &#8220;close to normal.&#8221; However, the amount Venezuela is exporting 
  to the United States does not necessarily imply that exports to other countries 
  would be similarly affected. In addition, other factors besides exports should 
  be analyzed to estimate Venezuelan production. In fact, EIA&#8217;s most current 
  estimate of Venezuelan crude oil production is 2.5 million barrels per day, 
  significantly less than the pre-strike level of 2.9 million barrels per day 
  as estimated in EIA&#8217;s <em><A HREF=
"http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/security/esar/latdis.html#prod" target="_blank"> 
Energy Situation Analysis Report </A></em>. 
  Qualitative statements about the level of U.S. crude oil imports are just one 
  piece of the puzzle in determining production levels from particular countries, 
  even after assuming normal shipping times between the countries and the United 
  States, and great care should be taken to not &#8220;over-interpret&#8221; this 
  data.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Rebuilding Heating Fuel Inventories</strong><br> Following one of the 
  most severe winters in recent years, the nation&#8217;s inventory of heating 
  fuels, including heating oil (high-sulfur distillate fuel) and propane, plunged 
  to near historical low levels at the end of March 2003. Preliminary March data 
  show heating oil inventories ended the 2002-03 heating season at an estimated 
  36.6 million barrels, a near-record low for March, while at the same time inventories 
  of propane fell to an estimated 19.5 million barrels, the lowest March level 
  in over 30 years. Although heating fuel markets appeared to have weathered last 
  winter without any major supply disruptions, the same may not be said for next 
  winter if heating fuel inventories fail to rebuild to adequate levels before 
  the onslaught of cold weather. The average summer stockbuild for heating oil 
  inventories over the most recent 5-year period totaled nearly 15 million barrels, 
  with inventories at the start of the heating season (beginning of October) ranging 
  from a low of 47.1 million barrels in 2000, to a high of nearly 80 million barrels 
  in 1998. Assuming the same 15 million average stockbuild occurs this year, heating 
  oil inventories would be expected to reach slightly above 51 million barrels 
  prior to the start of the 2003-04 heating season. At that level, U.S. heating 
  oil inventories would begin next winter at the second lowest level since 1996, 
  and would be more than 7 million barrels lower than last year when inventories 
  were barely above the low end of the normal range. But other factors may hinder 
  even an average stockbuild this year, including the recent strife in Venezuela 
  that nearly shut down that country&#8217;s oil industry, including its refineries. 
  Since most imports of distillate fuel come from Canada, the Virgin Islands, 
  and Venezuela, a resumption of imports of distillate fuel from Venezuela, in 
  particular, becomes crucial as the country struggles to regain pre-strike export 
  levels.</p>
<p>U.S inventories of propane began last winter&#8217;s heating season at nearly 
  71 million barrels, the highest pre-heating season level since 1998. But frigid 
  weather during January and February contributed to quickly reduce the nation&#8217;s 
  stockpile of propane to a record low 18.2 million barrels by week ending March 
  14, 2003. By month&#8217;s end, U.S. inventories had climbed slightly higher 
  to finish the 2002-03 heating season at an estimated 19.5 million barrels, the 
  lowest level for this month since 1970. Despite strong demand due to cold weather 
  last winter, U.S. inventories of propane helped moderate the effects of the 
  severe winter that otherwise would have been more debilitating on propane markets. 
  But the prospect of rebuilding propane inventories to prior year levels appears 
  to be in jeopardy. The typical off-season stockbuild, based on the most recent 
  5-year period, averaged slightly more than 36 million barrels. Consequently, 
  the pre-heating season level of propane inventories would total about 56 million 
  barrels, a level somewhat short of the 60-million-barrel level believed by industry 
  observers as adequate prior to the start of the heating season. Further complicating 
  the approaching summer stockbuild is the propane inventory situation in Canada 
  that is thought to be even more precarious than in the U.S. As recently as February 
  2003, Canadian inventories of propane fell below 1 million barrels, according 
  to the National Energy Board of Canada. Because Canada is the largest exporter 
  of propane to the U.S., any supply shortfalls would need to be rectified ahead 
  of any U.S. supply requirements, potentially hindering a previously secure supply 
  source. While it is too early to be to specific, the overall expectation is 
  that heating fuel inventories will more than likely begin the next heating season 
  much lower than last year, which could present a great risk to heating fuel 
  markets if the U.S. experiences a repeat of last winter&#8217;s weather without 
  the benefit of an inventory cushion.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Retail Gasoline Price Falls for the Fourth Week in a Row</strong><br>
  The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline fell last week for the fourth 
  week in a row. Prices dropped by 3.5 cents per gallon as of April 14 to hit 
  159.5 cents per gallon, which is still 19.1 cents per gallon higher than a year 
  ago. Over the last four weeks, the average price for regular gasoline has declined 
  by 13.3 cents per gallon. The decline reflects, in part, the reduction in crude 
  oil prices recently. Prices were down throughout the nation last week, with 
  the largest decrease occurring in the Midwest, where prices fell 4.1 cents per 
  gallon. Retail prices in California remained above $2 per gallon for the seventh 
  week in a row, decreasing to 207.7 cents per gallon. Average prices for the 
  West Coast fell below $2 per gallon for the first time in 5 weeks, averaging 
  196.7 cents per gallon on April 14.</p>

<p>Retail diesel fuel prices decreased for the fifth consecutive week, falling 
  1.5 cents per gallon to a national average of 153.9 cents per gallon as of April 
  14. Diesel fuel prices are down in conjunction with recent drops in crude oil 
  prices and in anticipation of looser market conditions. Retail diesel prices 
  were down throughout the nation, with the largest price decrease occurring in 
  New England, where prices fell 5.5 cents per gallon. Prices in the Central Atlantic 
  were the highest in the nation, averaging 170.4 cents per gallon, while prices 
  in the Gulf Coast were the lowest, averaging 145.5 cents per gallon.</p>

<p><strong>Propane Posts Modest Weekly Build</strong><br>
  U.S. inventories of propane posted a relatively modest 0.6-million-barrel build 
  during the week ending April 11 that pushed up inventories to an estimated 21.7 
  million barrels. The unexpected small rise continued to keep U.S. inventories 
  of propane below the average range for this period. Seasonal stock gains were 
  reported in the East Coast and Midwest regions last week with respective increases 
  totaling 0.2 million barrels and 0.7 million barrels, but the gains were partially 
  offset by the nearly 0.4-million-barrel drop in Gulf Coast inventories during 
  this same period. While the weekly stock gain in the East Coast moved inventories 
  closer to the middle of the average range for this time of year in that region, 
  the Midwest gain in inventories continued to fall short of moving the region&#8217;s 
  stocks to above the lower limits of the average range. The drop in Gulf Coast 
  inventories moved the region&#8217;s level of stocks further below the average 
  range last week. Inventories of propylene for non-fuel use fell to less than 
  1.7 million barrels from nearly 2.0 million barrels from the prior week, causing 
  a corresponding drop in the proportion to total propane/propylene inventories 
  to 7.8 percent from last week&#8217;s 9.3 percent.</p>
