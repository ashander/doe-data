<p align="left"><strong>As the Hour Draws Near</strong><br>
  With the possibility of war with Iraq just days or even hours away, oil markets 
  have ridden a wave of optimism over the last couple of days, as the anticipation 
  of a quick war has led many traders to go &#8220;short&#8221;, expecting prices 
  to fall following the onset of war. Believing that uncertainty over the war 
  with Iraq and the decrease in Venezuelan exports were the main reasons prices 
  had risen near $40 per barrel, many traders, and some analysts, expect that 
  prices will fall well below $30 per barrel, now that Venezuelan oil exports 
  are reportedly increasing and with the assumption that the war may be over soon 
  with little damage to the infrastructure in Iraq and elsewhere. But even if 
  this happens, which is arguable considering that oil prices rose over $30 per 
  barrel last year prior to the strikes in Venezuela, OPEC remains a critical 
  element to keeping prices below $30 per barrel.</p>
  
<p>Inevitably, comparisons have been made recently to the first Persian Gulf war 
  back in 1990/91. Although some traders were too young to participate in the 
  market back then, it is not so long ago that the history has been forgotten. 
  Many people remember when the near-month WTI futures contract price fell more 
  than $10 per barrel during the first trading day after commencement of the Allied 
  air war campaign in January 1991. While very few people expect prices to fall 
  that dramatically this time, the market does appear to be expecting a decline, 
  as the near-month WTI futures contract has fallen by nearly $6 per barrel over 
  the last week or so. However, there are a number of differences between now 
  and then.</p>
<p>Of course, the major difference is the level of inventories. Inventories reflect 
  the balance between supply and demand. When supplies are tight, inventories 
  can be drawn down to meet demand, and when supplies are ample, inventories can 
  be built so that they are available when demand picks up. Stock building usually 
  happens in the April through September period globally. Although product demand 
  globally falls in the second quarter, demand for crude oil remains high, as 
  refineries need to run at high enough rates to build up product inventories 
  while crude oil supplies also need to build. For the United States, with its 
  seasonal peak driven by summer gasoline demand, this implies a lot of crude 
  oil imports will be needed over the spring and summer months. And this year, 
  the inventory build will need to be greater than normal as oil inventories are 
  very low across the board, especially here in the United States. For the week 
  ending March 14, U.S. crude oil, gasoline, distillate fuel, residual fuel, and 
  propane inventories are all below the lower end of the normal range for this 
  time of year, with some of these products (notably crude oil and propane) very 
  near the lower operational inventory level.</p>

<p>This is somewhat different than the inventory situation just prior to the start 
  of the air war campaign in January 1991. To illustrate, EIA&#8217;s <u>Weekly Petroleum 
  Status Report</u> for the week ending January 11, 1991, shows that since the Iraqi 
  invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, the situation had worsened considerably, 
  particularly for crude oil. U.S. crude oil inventories, which were much higher 
  than normal at the end of July 1990, had fallen to slightly below the lower 
  end of the normal range by January 11, 1991. However, they were still 28 million 
  barrels above what was thought to be the minimum operating inventory level, 
  unlike today, when they are barely above the lower operating inventory level. 
  The comparisons are mixed when looking at the major petroleum products. U.S. 
  gasoline inventories as of the week ending January 11, 1991, were slightly below 
  the lower end of the normal range, similar to the situation that currently exists. 
  But the situation is much worse today than it was back on January 11, 1991 when 
  it comes to distillate fuel, and especially, residual fuel. At that time, U.S. 
  distillate fuel inventories, while low, were still within the normal range, 
  while residual fuel oil inventories were close to the upper end of the normal 
  range. </p>

<p>While efficiency gains since 1991 imply somewhat lower levels of inventory 
  may be sufficient to maintain smooth operations, and perhaps to a greater degree 
  than currently reflected in reduced estimates of minimum operating levels, oil 
  demand has risen enough over the last decade, arguably, to reduce usable forward 
  cover, compared with 1991 levels. What all this means is that inventories now 
  are not as well stocked as they were in January 1991, by any measure, meaning 
  a greater dependence on imported oil to meet demand. This puts the onus on OPEC 
  to maintain supplies at sufficient levels over the next few months, not only 
  to help inventories build at their normal rate, but above and beyond these rates 
  so that inventories can return to more normal levels. Until this happens, there 
  may be sufficient price pressure based on supply/demand fundamentals to support 
  prices near $30 per barrel. Any movement below this price may reflect an expectation 
  of an improving supply/demand picture, but if this improvement doesn&#8217;t 
  occur as expected, then prices will rise. With the latest weekly data continuing 
  to show U.S. crude oil imports closer to 8 million barrels per day as opposed 
  to 9 million barrels per day, let alone the expected levels closer to 10 million 
  barrels per day projected for this spring/summer, the next few weeks may be 
  a critical period.</p>


<p>Recently, there have been numerous reports about Saudi Arabia chartering additional 
  tankers to bring oil into the United States in May. This additional oil will 
  be critical, especially if Iraqi oil exports have not resumed at normal rates. 
  (And even if Iraqi oil fields remain undamaged, there is still some uncertainty 
  as to the administrative procedures that will need to be in place before Iraqi 
  oil exports resume at more than 2 million barrels per day.) But where will the 
  oil come from until then? There are reports that Venezuelan oil production has 
  been increasing. But doubt remains as to how fast production will continue to 
  increase and how close to pre-strike levels their production will reach later 
  this year. If Venezuelan oil production fails to increase much from current 
  levels, and Iraqi oil production remains constrained while the administrative 
  procedures are worked out, OPEC will need to maintain its high production levels 
  for several months. Will OPEC continue along this path or will it look to curb 
  production once prices start to fall? The answer to this question will determine 
  how quickly inventories will return to normal levels. While we may just be hours 
  away from the beginning of the end of this chapter on Iraq, we may still be 
  weeks, or even months away from seeing retail prices return to levels consumers 
  are used to paying, thus returning to a sense of &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in oil 
  markets.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Retail Gasoline Price Increases Again</strong><br>
  The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline rose last week for the thirteenth 
  time in fourteen weeks, increasing by 1.6 cents per gallon as of March 17 to 
  reach 172.8 cents per gallon, which is 44.0 cents per gallon higher than a year 
  ago. This price is 1.5 cents higher per gallon than the highest price in nominal 
  dollars since EIA began recording this data in August 1990. While the outlook 
  could go either way, strong gasoline demand ahead of the normal seasonal increase, 
  extensive refinery maintenance, and still tight crude oil supply, may be pointing 
  to added price pressure in the months ahead. Also, the effect of the possible 
  war in Iraq is impossible to predict, as the length of the conflict and collateral 
  damage to petroleum facilities, or the lack thereof, could push crude oil prices 
  either way. Prices were up throughout most of the country, with the largest 
  increase occurring in California, where prices rose 6.1 cents to end at 214.5 
  cents per gallon, the highest price ever in our survey, which for California 
  goes back to May 2000. This is the third week in a row that California prices 
  have been above $2 per gallon. Prices for the entire West Coast also breached 
  the $2 mark, hitting 204.1 cents per gallon on March 17, and prices in PADD 
  5 appear to be an important driver in the increase of national prices.</p>

<p>Retail diesel fuel prices decreased for the first time in nine weeks, falling 
  1.9 cents per gallon to a national average of 175.2 cents per gallon as of March 
  17. This decrease comes after four successive weeks of record prices. Retail 
  diesel prices were down throughout most the country, with the largest price 
  decrease occurring in the Midwest, where prices fell 3.0 cents per gallon to 
  end at 170.8 cents per gallon. Prices in New England remained the highest in 
  the nation, losing 1.0 cent to 199.1 cents per gallon. California saw a slight 
  price increase, with prices rising by 0.3 cent to end at 186.9 cents per gallon.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Heating Fuel Prices Continue to Decline</strong><br>
  Residential heating oil prices decreased 5.1 cents per gallon for the week ending 
  March 17, 2003, averaging 180.3 cents per gallon, but are 62.1 cents per gallon 
  higher than last year at this time. Meanwhile, wholesale heating oil prices 
  decreased 17.6 cents per gallon this past week, to 109.4 cents per gallon.</p>
  
  
<p>Residential propane prices decreased 7.2 cents per gallon to reach 158.2 cents 
  per gallon, and are 46.2 cents higher than one year ago. Wholesale propane prices 
  decreased 5.9 cents per gallon, from 80.4 cents per gallon to 74.5 cents per 
  gallon during the week ending March 17.</p>
<p>These prices come from the last survey done for the 2002/03 winter season. 
  Weekly retail and wholesale prices for heating oil and propane will restart 
  for the 2003/04 winter season beginning in October 2003.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Propane Inventories Slip Below LOI</strong><br>
  With the last vestiges of winter sweeping across the upper plains last week, 
  U.S. inventories of propane fell nearly 0.7 million barrels, slipping about 
  0.3 million barrels below the Lower Operational Level (LOI) to end the week 
  of March 14, 2003 at an estimated 18.2 million barrels. An inventory level below 
  the LOI may be indicative of a situation where supply flexibility could be constrained, 
  which some industry observers say is already occurring in some parts of the 
  nation as inventories reach historically low levels. Reports of supply constraints 
  were beginning to surface in the Mid-continent region in recent days as some 
  storage operators and pipeline companies were in effect scrambling to maintain 
  propane supplies to consumers in the region. Nevertheless, the Midwest region 
  reported a 0.8 million-barrel stockdraw last week, indicating propane supplies 
  are still flowing from primary storage. In contrast, East Coast inventories 
  grew by more than 0.1 million barrels last week while Gulf Coast inventories 
  remained unchanged during this same period.</p>
