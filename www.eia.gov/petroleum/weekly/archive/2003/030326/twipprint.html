<p align="left"><strong>Back to Normal?</strong><br>
  Although the origins of weekly crude oil imports are preliminary and thus not 
  published, imports from Venezuela last week seem to have returned to normal 
  levels for the first time since the week ending December 6, 2002. This was a 
  major reason why crude oil imports averaged nearly 9.7 million barrels per day 
  for the week ending March 21, the largest amount since December 6, 2002, and 
  the first week the average has exceeded 9 million barrels per day since the 
  week ending December 20, 2002. At the same time, the price of West Texas Intermediate 
  crude oil has recently dropped below $30 per barrel for the first time since 
  mid-December. So do the latest weekly U.S. petroleum data signal a return to 
  a more stable oil market?</p>
  
<p>Well, not so fast. For oil markets to return to a more &#8220;normal&#8221; 
  state, inventories of crude oil and the major petroleum products need to rise 
  from current low levels. However, the evidence so far suggests that either this 
  is not happening, or that if so, the pace is barely perceptible. Even with the 
  largest slug of crude oil imports since early December, crude oil inventories 
  remain about 25 million barrels below the lower end of the normal range and 
  about 41 million barrels below the middle of the normal range. While inventories 
  of gasoline and distillate fuel are not nearly as low as crude oil, these products 
  are also dwindling or in short supply. Gasoline inventories are currently about 
  6 million barrels below the lower end of the normal range and nearly 13 million 
  barrels below the middle, while distillate fuel inventories are about 4 million 
  barrels below the lower end of the normal range and nearly 16 million barrels 
  below the middle of the range. Looking across all commercial petroleum inventories, 
  as of March 21, they were nearly 41 million barrels below the lower end of the 
  normal range and nearly 91 million barrels below the middle of the range! </p>
<p>So, how do inventories move back to more &#8220;normal&#8221; levels, thus 
  reducing pressure on prices? The simple answer is either from more supply, less 
  demand, or both. While there has been a lot of talk about how global product 
  demand falls sharply in the second quarter (April through June), crude oil demand 
  does not, and in the United States, both crude and product demand increase much 
  of the time, barring abnormal weather and economic weakness. For example, in 
  2 out of the last 3 years, demand has actually increased in the second quarter 
  compared to the first quarter! (In 2000, U.S. oil demand was 200,000 barrels 
  per day higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter; in 2001, 
  it fell 290,000 barrels per day in the second quarter; and in 2002 it rose by 
  180,000 barrels per day in the second quarter.) Thus, while there may be an 
  improvement in the inventory situation brought about by a decline in consumption, 
  this may not happen, and even if it does, that may be a sign the economy is 
  not doing as well as many expect. So, it&#8217;s much more likely that inventories 
  will get back to more normal levels through an increase in supply, namely, by 
  imports.</p>

<p>An increase in crude oil imports will allow crude oil inventories to build 
  even as more crude oil is run through U.S. refineries. For example, even with 
  the large amount of crude oil imported last week, while crude oil inventories 
  did build at a fairly healthy rate (3.7 million barrels), crude oil inputs to 
  refineries actually declined some. This means less product was produced, which 
  helps explain why gasoline inventories fell (although distillate fuel inventories 
  did increase). To get both crude oil and petroleum product inventories to increase, 
  more crude oil needs to be imported in order to build up crude oil stocks and 
  increase inputs into refineries. Additionally, product imports will need to 
  be maintained at very high levels. Over the last four weeks, gasoline imports 
  have averaged nearly 900,000 barrels per day, while the last two weeks have 
  averaged 1 million barrels per day. This is extremely high for any time of the 
  year, even more so for March. Distillate fuel imports have also remained high, 
  averaging 550,000 barrels per day over the last four weeks. And yet inventories 
  for both major products remain low, with gasoline still declining last week.</p>

<p>As stated above, total commercial petroleum inventories are currently nearly 
  91 million barrels below the middle of the normal range. With crude oil imports 
  averaging about 9.4 million barrels per day in the second and third quarters 
  of the last three years, for inventories to rise toward the middle of the range, 
  it would take more than three months for this to happen should imports average 
  10.4 million barrels each day in the second quarter! And if supplies arrive 
  at a pace averaging nearly 10 million barrels per day, which may even be optimistic, 
  inventories would not return to the middle of the range until sometime in September. 
  So, while imports did increase to normal or even above normal levels this past 
  week, it will likely take many more weeks, or months, before U.S. petroleum 
  inventories return to normal levels.</p>


<p><strong>U.S. Retail Gasoline Price Decreases by Almost 4 Cents</strong><br>
  The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline fell last week after rising 
  thirteen of the previous fourteen weeks. Prices dropped by 3.8 cents per gallon 
  as of March 24 to hit 169.0 cents per gallon, which is still 34.8 cents per 
  gallon higher than a year ago. This is the largest one-week price decrease since 
  prices fell by 4.0 cents on November 26, 2001. The decline reflects, in part, 
  the reduction in crude oil prices recently. Prices were down throughout most 
  of the country, with the largest decrease occurring in the Midwest, where prices 
  fell 8.5 cents to end at 159.8 cents per gallon. California prices remained 
  above $2 per gallon for the fourth week in a row, falling to 214.3 cents per 
  gallon. Average prices for the West Coast also stayed above the $2 per gallon 
  mark, at 203.7 cents per gallon on March 24.</p>

<p>Retail diesel fuel prices decreased for the second consecutive week, falling 
  9.0 cents per gallon to a national average of 166.2 cents per gallon as of March 
  24. This is the largest one-week price decrease that has occurred since EIA 
  began collecting this data in March 1994. Recent price decreases can be largely 
  attributed to increases in supply that have exceeded demand for diesel. Retail 
  diesel prices were down throughout the country, with the largest price decrease 
  occurring in the Midwest, where prices fell 11.2 cents per gallon to end at 
  159.6 cents per gallon. Prices in New England remained the highest in the nation, 
  although they declined by 9.9 cents to 189.2 cents per gallon.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Propane Inventories Post Small Build</strong><br>
  Last week&#8217;s modest stockbuild may have signaled the end of winter with 
  U.S. inventories of propane gaining 0.8 million barrels to end the week of March 
  21, 2003 at an estimated 19.0 million barrels. The relatively small gain pushed 
  inventories slightly above the Lower Operational Limit (LOI) that was previously 
  breached for the first time ever on March 14, 2003. Moreover, the weekly stock 
  gain spanned across all regions with inventories in the East Coast posting a 
  0.1 million barrel increase, while inventories in the Midwest showed a gain 
  that was less than 0.1 million barrels last week. Inventories in the Gulf Coast 
  showed the largest weekly gain of nearly 0.6 million barrels during this period. 
  Nevertheless, if last week&#8217;s stockbuild marks the beginning of the spring/summer 
  seasonal build that typically stretches through September, U.S. inventories 
  of propane would require a stockbuild measuring more than 40 million barrels 
  to reach the 60 million barrel level that most industry observers believe is 
  adequate prior to the winter heating season.</p>
