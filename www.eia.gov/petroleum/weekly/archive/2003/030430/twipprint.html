<p align="left"><strong>What&#8217;s Next for Crude Oil</strong><br>
  With the war in Iraq virtually over and the start of the peak gasoline season 
  (Memorial Day weekend) less than a month away, many analysts are wondering what 
  the outlook for U.S. crude oil markets will be during the next few weeks. The 
  near-month futures price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has fallen 
  from almost $38 per barrel as of March 12 to slightly above $25 per barrel as 
  of April 29. Will the WTI price continue to fall or will it head in another 
  direction? By looking at what supply and demand might be over the next few weeks, 
  we may get an insight in the near-term future of U.S. crude oil markets.</p>

<p align="left">Crude Oil Demand<br>
  When looking at oil demand, most analysts look at refined product demand, i.e., 
  the sum of products such as gasoline, distillate fuel, jet fuel, etc. But when 
  looking at crude oil demand, a good proxy is how much crude oil is being used 
  in refineries, or, what is referred to as, crude oil input to refineries. So, 
  what is the near-term outlook for crude oil demand?</p>

<p>Although very high amounts of crude oil imports recently are gradually replenishing 
  crude oil inventories, which not that long ago were the lowest since 1975, refined 
  product inventories are also at low levels. Therefore, a logical assumption 
  would be that increased imports would not only replenish crude oil inventories, 
  but also would allow for an increase in refinery crude oil inputs. Following 
  seasonal refinery maintenance programs that typically take place during February 
  and early March, refinery inputs of crude oil generally increase during April, 
  as refiners race to build inventories of gasoline for the approaching summer 
  driving season. Looking at the most recent 5-year period, refiners averaged 
  a nearly 4.5-percent increase in crude oil inputs between March and April, with 
  crude runs increasing on average by 650 thousand barrels per day, and it seems 
  like the increase this April will be close to the average amount. However, the 
  data for May over the same 5-year period is a little less clear. Although crude 
  oil inputs increased an average of about 150,000 barrels per day from April 
  to May over the last 5 years, in two of the years, crude oil refinery inputs 
  actually declined in May. One factor that seems to be critical in determining 
  refiner behavior in May is gasoline prices, as many refiners use May to make 
  adjustments in refinery inputs depending on the gasoline supply situation. With 
  gasoline prices continuing to fall (see below) and record levels of imports 
  of gasoline arriving recently, there may not be a large increase in crude oil 
  refinery inputs in May. But this is clearly an area in which a lot of uncertainty 
  still exists.</p>

<p>Crude Oil Supply<br>
  When looking at the supply of crude oil, there are generally two sources to 
  measure: domestic production and imports. But since domestic production is usually 
  fairly constant over the near-term, any change in the near-term supply of crude 
  oil is likely to come from imports. Recently, imports have averaged much higher 
  than the same period last year. For example, over the last four weeks, crude 
  oil imports have averaged over 700,000 barrels per day more than during the 
  same period last year. This has allowed for an increase in crude oil refinery 
  inputs (as described above) as well as increasing very low crude oil inventories. 
  Will this trend continue?</p>

<p>While this is difficult to gauge, we can look at the origins of U.S. crude 
  oil imports recently to try and discern if there is some reason they might increase 
  or decrease in coming weeks. Although the origins of weekly crude oil imports 
  are preliminary and thus not published, we can look at the general trend and 
  attempt to make some conclusions about the future. Over the last five weeks, 
  imports from Saudi Arabia have increased significantly. Only once, in May 1991, 
  following the end of the first Gulf War, have U.S. crude oil imports from Saudi 
  Arabia averaged more than 2 million barrels per day over a whole month. Again, 
  although the data are preliminary and are subject to change, it does appear 
  that crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia in April may average close to this 
  level. This is consistent with estimates that show a significant increase in 
  crude oil production from Saudi Arabia in March. With the time lag in shipping 
  the oil, it takes at least one month for oil produced in Saudi Arabia to arrive 
  in the United States. If their production remained at high levels in April, 
  it&#8217;s likely that large amounts of crude oil from Saudi Arabia may continue 
  to arrive here next month. However, the situation may be different for Iraq. 
  Based on weekly data, the U.S. continued to import significant volumes of Iraqi 
  crude oil during the week ending April 25. However, with Iraqi oil exports stopping 
  in mid-March as the war began, given the 4-6 week shipping time, crude oil imports 
  from Iraq should stop completely at some point over the next few weeks, meaning 
  that crude oil imports from Iraq in May will be almost non-existent. Without 
  an offsetting increase in imports from somewhere else, this implies that U.S. 
  crude oil imports may decline over the next several weeks. Of course, imports 
  from other countries could rise, thus compensating for the inevitable shut-off 
  of U.S. crude oil imports from Iraq. But the magnitude of the imports the United 
  States has recently received from Iraq will make this scenario difficult, at 
  best.</p>

<p>So what does the future hold for U.S. crude oil markets? With a likely decline 
  in crude oil supply stemming from a drop in crude oil imports, it is unlikely 
  that crude oil prices will drop too much further over the next few months. But 
  whether they increase or not will depend on the supply and demand balance over 
  the next couple of months. And any change in crude oil prices will likely begin 
  to be reflected in retail gasoline prices within two to four weeks. Clearly, 
  the next few weeks will be critical in determining the status of oil markets 
  at the outset of the coming peak driving season.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Retail Gasoline Prices Continue to Drop</strong><br>
  The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline fell last week for the sixth 
  week in a row. Prices dropped by 1.7 cents per gallon as of April 28 to hit 
  155.7 cents per gallon, which is still 16.4 cents per gallon higher than a year 
  ago. Over the last six weeks, the average price for regular gasoline has declined 
  by 17.1 cents per gallon. The recent reductions in gasoline prices are largely 
  due to continuing decreases in crude oil prices. Prices were down throughout 
  the nation last week. The region with the lowest price is the Gulf Coast, where 
  prices for regular gasoline averaged 143.7 cents per gallon, while the region 
  with the highest price is the West Coast, where prices for regular gasoline 
  averaged 188.1 cents per gallon on April 28. However, the West Coast also saw 
  the largest price decrease, with prices falling 3.1 cents over the last week. 
  California fell below $2 per gallon after eight straight weeks above that mark, 
  decreasing by 3.2 cents to 197.7 cents per gallon.</p>

<p>Retail diesel fuel prices decreased for the seventh consecutive week, falling 
  2.1 cents per gallon as of April 28 to a national average of 150.8 cents per 
  gallon, which is still 20.6 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. Diesel 
  fuel prices are down in conjunction with recent drops in crude oil prices and 
  in anticipation of weaker market conditions. Retail diesel prices were down 
  throughout the nation last week. The region with the lowest price is the Gulf 
  Coast, where prices for diesel averaged 141.9 cents per gallon, while the region 
  with the highest price is New England, where prices averaged 166.2 cents per 
  gallon on April 28.</p>

<p><strong>Propane Inventories Unseasonably Lower</strong><br>
  Restocking efforts by the nation&#8217;s primary stockholders took a turn for 
  the worst last week after reporting a highly unseasonably 0.4 million-barrel 
  stockdraw that pushed U.S. inventories of propane lower, ending the week of 
  April 25, 2003 at an estimated 21.9 million barrels. This movement follows in 
  the footsteps of the past several weeks of weak to modest weekly stockbuilds 
  that have persisted since the end of the winter heating season in March. With 
  last week&#8217;s drop in inventories, the gap between the current level of 
  inventories and the lower limit of the average range of inventories for this 
  time of year widened to an estimated 8 million barrels. Although most of the 
  weekly decline in inventories occurred in the Midwest region, which fell by 
  almost 0.4 million barrels, the Gulf Coast region also reported a weekly decline 
  that measured nearly 0.1 million barrels. In contrast, inventories in the East 
  Coast region reported a modest 0.1-million-barrel gain during this same time. 
  Subsequently, inventories in the East Coast continued within the average range 
  last week while at the same time Midwest and Gulf Coast inventories continued 
  below their respective average ranges. Inventories of propylene for non-fuel 
  use remained relatively flat last week at 1.6 million barrels, a level that 
  accounts for 7.2 percent of total propane/propylene inventories.</p>
