  ranging between 30 and 200 days.</p>
<p><b>Anode:</b> A positive electrode, as in a battery, radio tube, etc.</p>
<p><b>Anthracite:</b> The highest rank of coal; used primarily for residential and
  commercial space heating. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal,
  often referred to as hard coal, containing a high percentage of fixed carbon
  and a&nbsp;low percentage of volatile matter. The moisture content of fresh-mined
  anthracite generally is less than 15 percent. The heat content of anthracite

  basis. The heat content of anthracite coal consumed in the United States
  averages 25 million Btu per ton, on the as-received basis (i.e., containing
  both inherent moisture and mineral matter). Note: Since the 1980&#146;s, anthracite
  refuse or mine waste has been used for steam electric power generation.
  This fuel typically has a heat content of 15 million Btu per ton or less.</p>
<p><b>Anthropogenic:</b> Made or generated by a human or caused by human activity.
  The term is used in the context of global climate change to refer to gaseous

  of natural gas supply and the sum of the components of natural gas disposition.
  These differences may be due to quantities lost or to the effects of data
  reporting problems. Reporting problems include differences due to the net
  result of conversions of flow data metered at varying temperature and pressure
  bases and converted to a standard temperature and pressure base; the effect
  of variations in company accounting and billing practices; differences
  between billing cycle and calendar period time frames; and imbalances resulting
  from the merger of data reporting systems that vary in scope, format, definitions,
  and type of respondents.</p>

  a normal part of Earth&#146;s atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a product of fossil-fuel
  combustion as well as other processes. It is considered a greenhouse gas
  as it traps heat (infrared energy) radiated by the Earth into the atmosphere
  and thereby contributes to the potential for global warming. The global
  warming potential (GWP) of other greenhouse gases is measured in relation
  to that of carbon dioxide, which by international scientific convention

<p><b>Carbon dioxide equivalent:</b> The amount of carbon dioxide by weight emitted
  into the atmosphere that would produce the same estimated radiative forcing
  as a given weight of another radiatively active gas. Carbon dioxide equivalents
  are computed by multiplying the weight of the gas being measured (for example,
  methane) by its estimated global warming potential (which is 25 for methane).
  &#147;Carbon equivalent units&#148; are defined as carbon dioxide equivalents multiplied
  by the carbon content of carbon dioxide (i.e., 12/44).</p>
<p><b>Carbon flux:</b> See <i>Carbon budget</i>.</p>
<p><b>Carbon intensity:</b> The amount of carbon by weight emitted per unit of energy
  consumed. A common measure of carbon intensity is weight of carbon per
  British thermal unit (Btu) of energy. When there is only one fossil fuel
  under consideration, the carbon intensity and the emissions coefficient
  are identical. When there are several fuels, carbon intensity is based
  on their combined emissions coefficients weighted by their energy consumption
  levels. See <i>Emissions coefficient</i> and <i>Carbon output rate</i>.</p>
<p><b>Carbon output rate:</b> The amount of carbon by weight per kilowatthour of
  electricity produced.</p>

  terrestrial biosphere (usually including freshwater systems), oceans, and
  sediments (including fossil fuels).</p>
<p><b>Catalytic converter:</b> A device containing a catalyst for converting automobile

  years as exhibited by temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and precipitation. </p>
<p><b>Climate change:</b> A term that refers to a change in the state of the climate
  that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in
  the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for
  an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be
  due to natural internal processes or external forcings, or to persistent
  anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.</p>

  but opaque to long-wave (infrared) radiation, thus preventing long-wave
  radiant energy from leaving the Earth&#146;s atmosphere. The net effect is a
  trapping of absorbed radiation and a tendency to warm the planet&#146;s surface.</p>

<p><b>Heating degree-days (HDD):</b> A measure of how cold a location is over a period
  of time relative to a base temperature, most commonly specified as 65 degrees
  Fahrenheit. The measure is computed for each day by subtracting the average
