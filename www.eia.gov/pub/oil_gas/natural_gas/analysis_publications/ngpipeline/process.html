          <p>Transporting   natural gas from the wellhead to the final customer involves several physical transfers of custody and multiple processing steps. A natural gas pipeline system begins at the natural gas producing well   or field.&nbsp; Once the gas leaves the producing well, a pipeline gathering system directs the   flow either to a natural gas processing plant or directly to the mainline   transmission grid, depending upon the initial quality of the wellhead product.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The   processing plant produces pipeline-quality natural gas.&nbsp; This gas is then transported by pipeline to consumers or is put into underground storage for future use.&nbsp; Storage helps to   maintain pipeline system operational integrity and/or to meet customer requirements during peak-usage periods.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Transporting  natural gas from wellhead to market  involves a series of  processes and an array of  physical facilities. Among these are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="report_bold">Gathering   Lines</span> &ndash; These small-diameter pipelines move natural gas from the   wellhead to the natural gas processing plant or to an interconnection with a   larger mainline pipeline.&nbsp;          </li>
            <li><strong>Processing   Plant</strong> &ndash; This operation extracts natural gas liquids and   impurities  from the natural gas stream. </li>
            <li><strong>Mainline Ttransmission   Systems</strong> &ndash; These wide-diameter, long-distance   pipelines transport natural gas from the producing area to market  areas. </li>
            <li><strong>Market   Hubs/Centers</strong> &ndash; Locations where pipelines intersect and   flows are transferred.&nbsp;          </li>
            <li><strong>Underground Storage   Facilities</strong> &ndash; Natural gas is stored in depleted oil   and gas reservoirs, aquifers, and salt caverns for future use. </li>
            <li><strong>Peak   Shaving</strong> &ndash; System design methodology  permitting a natural gas pipeline to    meet short-term surges in customer demands with minimal infrastructure. Peaks can be handled by using gas from   storage or by short-term line-packing. &nbsp;

        <p><strong><a name="gathering_system"></a>The Natural Gas Gathering System</strong></p>
        <p>A natural gas pipeline system begins   at a natural gas producing well or field. In the producing area many of the   pipeline systems are primarily involved in "gathering" operations. That is, a   pipeline is connected to a producing well, converging with pipes from other   wells where the natural gas stream may be subjected to an extraction   process to remove water and  other impurities if needed. Natural gas exiting the production field  is usually referred to as "wet" natural gas if it still contain   significant amounts of hydrocarbon liquids and contaminants. </p>
        <p>Under certain conditions some or all   of the natural gas produced at a well may be returned to the reservoir in   cycling, repressuring, or conservation operations   and/or vented and flared. At this stage it is a mixture of methane and other   hydrocarbons, as well as some non-hydrocarbons,   existing in the gaseous phase or in a solution with crude oil. The principal   hydrocarbons normally contained in the natural gas mixture are methane, ethane,   propane, butane, and pentane. Typical non-hydrocarbon gases that may be present   in reservoir natural gas are water vapor, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen   sulfide, and nitrogen.</p>

	    <td class="SubSection" colspan="3"> <p >In proximity to the well are   facilities that produce what is referred to as "lease condensate", that is, a   mixture consisting primarily of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons which is recovered as a liquid from natural gas. Other natural gas   liquids, such as butane and propane, are recovered at downstream natural gas   processing plants or facilities (see <a href="process.html#processing_plant">below</a>).</p>
	      <p>Once it leaves the producing area, a   pipeline system directs flow either to a natural gas processing plant or   directly to the mainline transmission grid. Nonassociated natural gas, that is, natural gas that is not   in contact with significant quantities of crude oil in the reservoir, is   sometimes of pipeline quality after undergoing a decontamination   process in the production area, and does not need to flow through a   processing plant prior to entering the mainline transmission system.</p>          
        <p><A name="processing_plant"></A><STRONG>The Natural Gas   Processing Plant</STRONG><strong></strong></p>
        <p>The principal service provided by a   natural gas processing plant to the natural gas mainline transmission network is   that it produces pipeline quality natural gas. Natural gas mainline transmission   systems are designed to operate within certain tolerances. Natural gas entering   the system that is not within certain specific gravities, pressures,  Btu   content range, or water content level will cause operational problems, pipeline   deterioration, or even cause pipeline rupture.</p>
        <p>Natural gas processing plants are   also facilities designed to recover natural gas liquids from a stream of natural   gas that may or may not have passed through lease separators and/or field   separation facilities. These facilities also control the quality of the natural   gas to be marketed. Several types of natural gas processing plants, employing various  techniques and technologies to extract contaminants and natural gas liquids, are used to produce pipeline quality &quot;dry&quot; gas. At many processing plants the primary objective is the production of dry gas (demethanizing). Any remaining natural gas liquids extraction stream is directed to a separate plant to undergo  what is referred to as a &quot;fractionation&quot; process. </p>
        <p>But a number of natural gas processing plants do include    these fractionation facilities, where saturated hydrocarbons are removed from   natural gas and separated into distinct parts, or "fractions," such as propane,   butane, and ethane. Essentially, natural gas is methane, a colorless, odorless,   flammable hydrocarbon gas (CH<sub>4</sub>). Also present in natural gas   production, especially that in association with oil production, are a number of petroleum gases. They include (in   addition to ethane, propane and butane) ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutane, and   isobutylene. They are derived from crude oil refining or natural gas   fractionation and are liquefied through pressurization.<strong> </strong></p>        
        <p><A name="transmission_grid"></A><STRONG>The Transmission   Grid and Compressor Stations </STRONG><strong></strong></p>
        <p>The natural gas mainline   (transmission line) is a wide-diameter, often-times long-distance, portion of a   natural gas pipeline system, excluding laterals, located between the gathering   system (production area), natural gas processing plant, other receipt points,   and the principal customer service area(s). The lateral, usually of smaller   diameter, branches off the mainline natural gas pipeline to connect with or   serve a specific customer or group of customers. </p>
        <p>A natural gas mainline system will   tend to be designed as either a grid or a trunkline system. The latter is usually a long-distance,   wide-diameter pipeline system that generally links a major supply source with a    market area or with a large pipeline/LDC serving a market area. Trunklines tend to have fewer receipt points (usually at the   beginning of its route), fewer delivery points, interconnections with other   pipelines, and  associated lateral lines. </p>
        <p>A grid type transmission system is   usually characterized by a large number of laterals or branches from the   mainline, which tend to form a network of integrated receipt, delivery and   pipeline interconnections that operate in, and serve major market areas. In   form, they are similar to a local distribution company (LDC) network   configuration, but on a much larger scale.</p>
        <p>Between the producing area, or   supply source, and the market area, a number of<A name="_compressor_stations"></A> compressor   stations are located along the transmission system. These   stations contain one or more compressor units whose purpose is to receive the   transmission flow (which has decreased in pressure since the previous compressor   station) at an intake point, increase the pressure and rate of flow, and thus,   maintain the movement of natural gas along the pipeline. </p>
        <p>Compressor units that are used on a   natural gas mainline transmission system are usually rated at 1,000 horsepower   or more and are of the centrifugal (turbine) or reciprocating (piston) type. The   larger compressor stations may have as many as 10-16 units with an overall   horsepower rating of from 50,000 to 80,000 HP and a throughput capacity exceeding three billion cubic feet of natural   gas per day. Most compressor units operate on natural gas (extracted from the   pipeline flow); but in recent years, and mainly for environmental reasons, the   use of electricity driven compressor units has been growing. </p>
        <p>Many of the larger mainline   transmission routes are what is generally referred to   as <STRONG>"<A name="looped"></A></STRONG>looped<STRONG>."</STRONG> Looping is when one pipeline is laid   parallel to another and is often used as a way to increase capacity along a   right-of-way beyond what is possible on one line, or an expansion of an existing   pipeline(s). &nbsp;&nbsp;These lines are connected to move a larger   flow along a single segment of the pipeline system. Some very large pipeline   systems have 5 or 6 large diameter pipes laid along the same right-of-way.   Looped pipes may extend the distance between compressor stations, where they can   transfer part of their flow, or the looping may be limited to only a portion of   the line between stations. In the latter case, the looping often serves as   essentially a storage device, where natural gas can be line-packed as a way to   increase deliveries to local customers during certain peak   periods.</p>
        <p><A name="To_address_the_potential"></A> To address the   potential for   pipeline rupture, safety   cutoff meters are installed along a mainline transmission   system route. Devices located at strategic points are designed to detect a drop in   pressure that would result from a downstream or upstream pipeline rupture and   automatically stop the flow of natural gas beyond its location. Monitoring the   pipeline as a whole are apparatus known as <A name="SCADA_"></A>(SCADA <A name="Systems_Control_and_Data_Acquisition"></A>Systems Control and Data   Acquisition) systems. SCADA systems provide monitoring staff the ability to   direct and control pipeline flows, maintaining pipeline integrity and pressures   as natural gas is received and delivered along numerous points on the system,   including flows into and out of storage facilities.</p>        
        <p><a name="market_centers" id="market_centers"></a><STRONG>Natural Gas Market   Centers/Hubs</STRONG></p>
        <p>Natural gas market centers and hubs   evolved, beginning in the late 1980s, as an outgrowth of natural gas market   restructuring and the execution of a number of&nbsp; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&rsquo;s   (FERC) Orders culminating in Order 636 issued in 1992. Order 636 mandated that   interstate natural gas pipeline companies transform themselves from buyers and   sellers of natural gas to strictly natural gas transporters. Market centers and   hubs were developed to provide new natural gas shippers with many of the   physical capabilities and administrative support services formally handled by   the interstate pipeline company as &ldquo;bundled&rdquo; sales services. </p>
        <p>Two  key services offered by   market centers/hubs are transportation between and interconnections with other   pipelines and the physical coverage of short-term receipt/delivery balancing   needs.&nbsp; Many of these centers also   provide unique services that help expedite and improve the natural gas   transportation process overall, such as Internet-based access to natural gas   trading platforms and capacity release programs. Most also provide title   transfer services between parties that buy, sell, or move their natural gas   through the center.</p>
        <p>As of the end of 2008, there were   a total of 33 operational market centers in the   United   States (24) and   Canada (9).</p>        
        <p><A name="storagenew"></A><STRONG>Underground Storage   Facilities</STRONG><strong></strong></p>
        <p>At the end of the mainline   transmission system, and sometimes at its beginning and in between, underground   natural gas storage and LNG (liquefied natural gas) facilities provide for   inventory management, supply backup, and the access to natural gas to maintain   the balance of the system. There are three principal types of<strong> </strong><A href="UGTable.html" target="_self">underground   storage sites</A><strong> </strong>used   in the United States today: depleted reservoirs in oil and/or gas fields,   aquifers, and salt cavern formations. In one or two cases mine caverns have been   used. Two of the most important characteristics of an underground storage   reservoir are the capability to hold natural gas for future use, and the rate at   which natural gas inventory can be injected and withdrawn (its deliverability   rate). </p>
        <p>Most underground storage facilities,   327 out of 399 at the beginning of 2008, are depleted reservoirs, which are close to consumption   centers and which were relatively easy to convert to storage service. In some   areas, however, most notably the Midwestern United States, some natural aquifers   have been converted to natural gas storage reservoirs. An aquifer is suitable   for natural gas storage if the water-bearing sedimentary rock formation is   overlaid with an impermeable cap rock. While the geology of aquifers is similar   to that of depleted production fields, their use in natural gas storage usually   requires more base (cushion) gas and greater monitoring of withdrawal and   injection performance. Deliverability rates may be enhanced by the presence of   an active water drive.</p>
        <p>During the past 20 years, the number   of salt cavern storage sites has grown significantly because of its rapid   cycling (inventory turnover) capability coupled with its ability to respond to   daily, even hourly, variations in customer needs. The large majority of salt   cavern storage facilities have been developed in salt dome formations located in   the Gulf Coast States. Salt caverns leached from bedded salt formations in   Northeastern, Midwestern, and Western States have also been developed but the   number has been limited due to a lack of suitable geology. Cavern construction   is more costly than depleted field conversions when measured on the basis of   dollars per thousand cubic feet of working gas capacity, but the ability to   perform several withdrawal and injection cycles each year reduces the per-unit   cost of each thousand cubic feet of natural gas injected and withdrawn.</p>        
        <p><A name="peak"></A><STRONG>Peak   Shaving</STRONG><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Underground natural gas storage   inventories provide suppliers with the means to meet peak customer requirements   up to a point. Beyond that point the distribution system still must be capable   of meeting customer short-term peaking and volatile swing demands that occur on a daily and even   hourly basis. During periods of extreme usage, peaking facilities, as well as   other sources of temporary storage, are relied upon to supplement system and   underground storage supplies.</p>
        <p>Peaking needs are met in several   ways. Some underground storage sites are designed to provide peaking service,   but most often LNG (liquefied natural gas) in storage and liquefied petroleum gas such as propane are   vaporized and injected into the natural gas distribution system supply to meet   instant requirements. Short-term linepacking is also used to meet   anticipated surge requirements. </p>
        <p>The use of peaking facilities, as   well as underground storage, is essentially a risk-management calculation, known   as peak-shaving. The cost of installing these facilities is such that the   incremental cost per unit is expensive. However, the cost of a service   interruption, as well as the cost to an industrial customer in lost production,   may be much higher. In the case of underground storage, a suitable site may not   be locally available. The only other alternative might be to build or reserve   the needed additional capacity on the pipeline network. Each alternative entails   a cost.</p>
        <p>A local natural gas distribution   company (LDC) relies on supplemental supply sources (underground storage, LNG,   and propane) and uses linepacking to "shave" as much   of the difference between the total maximum user requirements (on a peak day or   shorter period) and the baseload customer requirements   (the normal or average) daily usage. Each unit "shaved" represents less demand   charges (for reserving pipeline capacity on the trunklines between supply and market areas) that the LDC   must pay. The objective is to maintain sufficient local underground natural gas   storage capacity and have in place additional supply sources such as LNG and   propane air to meet large shifts in daily demand, thereby minimizing capacity   reservation costs on the supplying pipeline.</p>        <p class="SubSection">&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
