            <b class="CategoryTitle"><strong>U.S. Natural   Gas Regulatory Authorities</strong></span></b><br>
          <b><a href="regulatory.html#overview">Beginning</a> |  <a href="regulatory.html#overviex">Regulations Today </a> | <a href="regulatory.html#domestic">Coordinating Agencies</a> | <a href="regulatory.html#companies">Regulation of Mergers and Acquisitions</a> </b>          </p>
          <p><strong><a name="overview"></a>Beginning   of Industry Restructuring</strong></p>
          <p>In April 1992,   the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission <a href="http://www.ferc.gov">(FERC)</a> issued its Order 636 and transformed the interstate natural gas transportation segment of the industry forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under it,  interstate natural gas pipeline  companies were required to restructure their operations by November 1993 and   split-off any non-regulated merchant (sales) functions from their regulated transportation functions.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This new   requirement meant that interstate natural gas pipeline companies were allowed to only transport natural gas for their customers. &nbsp;The restructuring process and   subsequent operations have been supervised closely by FERC and have led to   extensive changes throughout the interstate natural gas transportation segment which   have impacted other segments of the industry as well.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong><a name="overviex"></a>Regulations   Today</strong></p>
          <p>Most natural gas pipelines in the United   States, including many in the intrastate segment as well,  now only transport natural gas  and  no longer buy and sell it. Although  interstate natural gas pipelines are no longer subject to as much regulation as before Order 636,  many aspects of their operations   and business practices, are still subject to regulatory oversight.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For   example, FERC determines the rate-setting methods for interstate pipeline   companies, sets rules for business practices, and has the sole responsibility for   authorizing the siting, construction, and operations of interstate pipelines,   natural gas storage fields, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Regulatory   bodies have the authority to suspend some rules and regulations under specific   circumstances, especially in response to emergency and disaster situations,   placing needed projects on a regulatory fast-track.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="domestic"></a>Coordinating   with other Regulatory Agencies</strong></p>
          <p>Almost all   applications to FERC for interstate natural gas pipeline projects require some   level of coordination with one or more other Federal agencies.&nbsp; For example, the   Environmental Protection Agency assists FERC and/or State authorities in   determining if the environmental aspects of a pipeline development project meet   acceptable guidelines.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;FERC is also required to take the lead on the   environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, the   Endangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the   Magnuson-Stevens Act.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Governing   the safety standards, procedures, and actual development and expansion of any   pipeline system is the job of the U.S. Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Office of   Pipeline Safety (OPS).&nbsp; A pipeline may not begin operations until a line, or   line segment, has been certified safe by the OPS.&nbsp; The OPS retains jurisdiction   for safety over the lifetime of the pipeline. </p>
          <p><strong><a name="companies"></a>Regulation   of Mergers and Acquisitions</strong></p>
          <p>To help   ensure fairness and to preserve open markets, agencies at the Federal, State,   and sometimes local levels examine mergers and acquisitions. &nbsp;Among those most   actively involved in examining mergers and acquisitions at the Federal level are   FERC, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal   Revenue Service, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.&nbsp; State public utility   commissions, or their equivalent, also have responsibility for oversight in   mergers and acquisitions of pipeline companies. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Each of   the various agencies has the power to impose conditions that must be met to get   approval for a merger or acquisition. &nbsp;&nbsp;If these conditions are not satisfied,   the agencies can prevent the corporate combination from taking place.&nbsp; For   example, analysis of mergers or acquisitions for potential harm to the consumer   is under the shared jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission and the   Department of Justice, where the concept of market power plays a central role in   the antitrust review process. </p>
