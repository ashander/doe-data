          <p><strong>Overview<a name="overview"></a></strong>
          </p>
          <p>A   principal requirement of the natural gas transmission system is that it be   capable of meeting the peak demand of its shippers who have contracts for firm   service.</p>
          <p>To meet   this requirement, the facilities developed by the natural gas transmission   industry are a combination of transmission pipelines to bring the gas to the   market areas and of underground natural gas storage sites and liquefied natural gas   (LNG) peaking facilities located in the market areas. </p>
          <p><a name="domestic"></a><strong>Sizes   of Transmission Lines and Integrated Storage Sites </strong></p>
          <p>The design   of natural gas transmission pipelines and integrated storage sites represents a balance of the   most efficient and economical mix of delivery techniques given the operational   requirements facing the pipeline company, the number and types of transportation customers, and available access to supplies from production   areas or from underground storage.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Many   natural gas pipeline systems are configured principally for the long-distance transmission of   natural gas from production regions to market areas. These long-distance systems   are often referred to as trunklines.</p>
          <p>At the   other extreme are the grid systems, which generally operate in and serve major   market areas. &nbsp;Many of the grid systems can be categorized as regional   distribution systems.&nbsp; For the most part, they receive their supplies of natural   gas from the major trunklines or directly from local production areas.&nbsp; The grid   systems transport natural gas to local distribution companies and large-volume consumers.   &nbsp;</p>
          <p><a name="imports"></a><strong>Design   Criteria and Pipeline Size</strong></p>
          <p>The design   process includes the development of cost estimates for various possible   combinations of pipe size, compression equipment, and inter-station distances to   find the optimal combination that minimizes the transportation cost, given the desired   flexibility and expandability goals. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>New   trunklines typically are built with a larger diameter pipe than will be needed   initially but  with compression capacity limited to meeting current needs. &nbsp;Compressors   can be added, in either new or existing stations, to increase capacity as growth   in load occurs.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>A number   of factors are involved in calculating how much natural gas a pipeline can carry. &nbsp;However, the   most important factors are the diameter of the pipe and its operating pressure.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Standard   design codes require that all pipelines passing through populated areas reduce its maximum operating pressures for safety reasons.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>It had   become common practice to maintain nominal pipe diameter but increase wall   thickness where a line had to be derated for its surroundings (change in external stresses due to earth or traffic loads) in order   to keep the working pressure rating more constant along the line.&nbsp; Increasing   the pipe wall thickness or strength of the pipe will enable the pipe to   withstand a greater pressure between operating and design pressure to adhere to   safety requirements.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><a name="importx"></a><strong>Importance of Underground Storage Integration </strong></p>
          <p>Underground storage is an  essential component of an efficient and reliable interstate natural gas  transmission and distribution network. The size and profile of the transmission  system often depends in part on the availability of storage. </p>
          <p>Access to  underground natural gas storage facilities, particularly those located in  consuming areas, permits the mainline transmission pipeline operator to design  the portion of its system located upstream of storage facilities  to  accommodate the level of total shipper firm (reserved) capacity commitments and the  pipeline operator&rsquo;s potential storage injection needs, commonly referred to as  &ldquo;baseload&rdquo; requirements.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> The portion of  the transmission system located downstream of the storage area (including LNG peaking facilities) is designed to accommodate the maximum peak-period requirements of  shippers, local distribution companies, and consumers in the area. It is  generally sized to reflect the total peak-day withdrawal (deliverability) level  of all storage facilities linked to the system and estimated potential  peak-period demand requirements. </p>
          <p>The daily deliverability  from storage can also be factored into  the design needs of a new pipeline or the expansion needs of an existing one.  Some underground storage facilities are located in production areas at the  beginning of the pipeline corridor and, in contrast to storage near consuming  markets, can be used to store gas that may not be marketable at the time of  production. </p>
          <p>For instance, natural gas produced in association with oil  production is a function of oil market decisions, which may not coincide with  natural gas demand or available pipeline capacity to transport the gas to  end-use markets. Another example is the storage of natural gas produced from  low-pressure wells, which may be injected into storage during the off-peak  season and delivered, at high pressure, to the mainline during the peak  season.</p>
          <p> These sites can be used by shippers to store short-term incremental  supplies that exceed their reserve capacity on the pipeline system and the  reverse when supplies fall below reserved capacity. Thus, the pipeline is  relieved of additional demands for capacity brought on by temporary swings in the transportation demands of its customers. </p>
          <p><a name="companies"></a><strong>Overall   Pipeline System Configuration</strong></p>
          <p>            The   overall pipeline system configuration should  result in a comparatively lower usage  level (load factor) for downstream facilities in the summer season but a much  higher, albeit shorter term, usage level during the peak-demand season. The upstream trunkline portion of the system, on the other hand, could operate at a more sustained  high load factor throughout the year. (This design minimizing is oftentimes  referred to as peak-shaving.)&nbsp;</p>
          <p> With underground natural gas  storage and LNG peaking facilities configured into a natural gas pipeline  system, especially  one serving climate-sensitive markets such as the  Midwest and Northeast, system operators can minimize the facilities and costs  involved in building the &ldquo;trunkline&rdquo; portion of their system. Natural gas  shippers, on the other hand, could avoid  unnecessary costs incurred if they  reserved additional firm capacity on an entire transmission system,  rather than only a portion that would be used only on a few days during the  winter season.</p>
          <p>            During  the nonheating season, for instance, when shippers do not need all the contracted capacity   to meet their customer&rsquo;s current consumption requirements, natural gas can be  transported and injected into storage. By the beginning of the heating season  (November 1), inventory levels are generally at their annual peak. Working gas, the portion of natural gas in storage sites  available for  withdrawal and delivery to markets, is then withdrawn during periods of peak  demand.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> In addition, the pipeline  company  can avoid the need to expand transmission capacity from  production areas by using existing, or establishing new storage facilities in  market areas where there is a strong seasonal variation in demand and where the  system may be subjected to operational imbalances. </p>
