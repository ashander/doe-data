              Twenty interstate natural gas pipeline systems operate within the Northeast Region (Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia).&nbsp; These interstate pipelines deliver natural gas to several intrastate natural gas pipelines and at least 50 local distribution companies in the region. In addition, they also serve  large industrial concerns and, increasingly,  natural gas fired electric power generation facilities.            </p>
            <p>The natural gas pipeline and local distribution companies serving the Northeast have access to supplies from several major domestic natural gas producing areas and from Canada. Domestic natural gas flows into the region from the Southeast into Virginia and West Virginia, and from the Midwest into West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Canadian imports come into the region principally through New York, Maine, and New Hampshire. </p>
            <p>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies also enter the region through import terminals located in Massachusetts, Maryland, and New Brunswick, Canada. <br />

              <strong><a name="domestic" id="domestic"></a></strong>
            <br />
            </p>
            <p>Almost   all of the interstate natural gas pipelines entering or operating within the Northeast   Region terminate there as well, including several very large long-distance   natural gas pipeline systems that deliver supplies to the region from natural gas producing areas in   the U.S. Southwest. The largest of these natural gas pipelines is the Transcontinental   Gas Pipeline Company system (8.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day systemwide), which extends from South   Texas to the New   York City area. </p>
            <p>The Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (6.7   Bcf per day) and Texas Eastern Transmission Company (7.3 Bcf per day) natural gas pipeline systems bring supplies to the Northeast from Texas, Louisiana,   and the Gulf   of Mexico.   The Tennessee   Gas Pipeline Company system,   unlike the Transcontinental   Gas Pipeline Company and Texas   Eastern Transmission Company systems, extends its service northward as far as New Hampshire and is a major   transporter of natural gas to Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. (Note: The Texas   Eastern Transmission Company system was the first natural gas pipeline system to extend from the Southwest to   the Northeast Region with the conversion of the <A title="You will be leaving the EIA.DOE.GOV domain and entering an external link.

            <p>The Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company system is also a significant source of supply for the regional Algonquin   Gas Transmission Company system, which is the principal interstate natural gas pipeline serving the Boston, Massachusetts area. The Texas   Eastern Transmission Company,   an affiliate of the Algonquin   Gas Transmission Company,   is the primary source of supply for that pipeline, delivering approximately 65   percent of Algonquin&rsquo;s requirements at interconnections in New   Jersey.   The Algonquin   Gas Transmission Company system   (1,100 miles) has the capability to move 1.5 Bcf per day of its 3.3 Bcf per day   system capacity from New   Jersey into the New   York metropolitan area.</p>

          <p>The Algonquin Gas Transmission Company is also the  recipient of 0.8 Bcf per day of natural gas processed at the Northeast Gateway liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal  (installed in late 2008) located  10 miles offshore of Massachusetts.  The Northeast Gateway port's infrastructure  features two submerged turret loading buoys for off loading. The operation is linked to the Algonquin Gas Transmission Company system by a 16-mile submereged pipeline. It is the first new LNG terminal built on the East Coast in 30 years.</p>
          <p>The   largest interstate natural gas pipeline system operating in the region is Columbia   Gas Transmission Company (9.4 Bcf per day capacity). Columbia has an extensive network of natural gas pipelines that provide service in the region to the   States of Maryland, New   Jersey, New   York, Pennsylvania, Virginia,   and West   Virginia,   but also extends into Ohio in the Midwest and Kentucky and North   Carolina in the Southeast Region. Columbia receives Gulf-of-Mexico natural gas at the Kentucky border from its major trunkline transporter, Columbia   Gulf Transmission Company, but it also transports Appalachian (regional) production as   well.</p>
          <p>In late 2008, the long-delayed  0.5 Bcf per day Millennium Pipeline was finally completed. This 182-mile natural gas pipeline system  begins at an interconnect with the Empire Pipeline system in southwest central New York State and terminates in the New York City metropolitan area. It is part of an overall regional effort  involving expansion of the   existing Empire, Algonquin and Iroquois Pipelines, which will be among its major supply sources. </p>
          <p>The Dominion   Transmission Company system, although not as extensive as the Columbia   Gas Transmission Company system, serves the same States, except for New   Jersey.   Neither interstate pipeline, however, extends service to the New England States. Both   companies are also the major suppliers of some of the largest LDCs in the   region, some of which are affiliates.</p>
          <p>In   addition to the interstate natural gas pipeline companies that bring natural gas into the region,   several smaller interstate natural gas pipeline companies operate totally within the region.   Among these are  systems such as Equitrans   Inc. (0.1 Bcf per day), serving West   Virginia and western Pennsylvania,   that were developed to move local production to regional markets. West   Virginia,   western Pennsylvania,   and southwestern New   York were once the region's and the Nation's largest natural gas producing areas and,   consequently, have many local gathering, distribution, and storage   interconnections. These local facilities also have many interconnections with   natural gas pipeline operations in Ohio,   which is the reason for the 2.1 Bcf per day of capacity exiting the region to   the Midwest.</p>
          <p>Some   of these smaller interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines serve niche areas within   the region. For instance, Eastern   Shore Natural Gas Company (0.1 Bcf per day) is the only natural gas pipeline serving southern Delaware and the lower Delmarva   Peninsula.   It receives its supplies from Transcontinental   Gas Pipeline Company and Columbia   Gas Transmission Company at   points in southeastern Pennsylvania, with a route that takes it southward   through Delaware to Maryland's eastern shore.</p>
          <p>Further   to the north, Granite   State Transmission Company (0.1 Bcf per day) receives natural gas from the Tennessee   Gas Pipeline Company and/or the PNGTS/Maritimes   and Northeast Pipeline system at the southern New Hampshire/Massachusetts border. From there it   transports to customers in New   Hampshire and to the Northern   Utilities Company system   -- which has been the historical source of natural gas for the southern portion   of the State of Maine.   While the KeySpan   Energy Delivery Company is the principal provider of natural gas service to New   York City and Long   Island, New   York,   its intrastate operations now also include service in Massachusetts and New   Hampshire as well.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance of Canadian Imports to the Region</strong><a name="imports" id="imports"></a><br />
          </p>
          <p>During   the past 17 years (1990-2005), several new natural gas pipelines were built that   substantially increased regional access to Canadian natural gas supplies. </p>
          <p>The Iroquois   Gas Transmission Company system,   completed in 1991, draws just over one Bcf per day off the TransCanada   Pipeline Ltd system in Ontario, Canada,   a large portion of which is delivered to the New   York City metropolitan area. The Empire   Pipeline Company system (0.7 Bcf per day), built in 1994, and an intrastate affiliate of National   Fuel Gas Supply Corporation,   brings in Canadian natural gas at Grand Island, New York (near Niagara Falls) to   north central New York State with interconnections to the Dominion   Transmission Company and National   Fuel Gas Supply Corporation systems.   These latter two companies also access Canadian supplies via Tennessee   Gas Pipeline,   which maintains a 0.9 Bcf per day import point at Niagara   Falls, New   York. <A href="impex_map.html">[Map </A>and<A href="http://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline/impex_list.html"> Table </A>of   Import/Export Points<A href="impex_map.html">]</A></p>
          <p>Moreover,   in 2000, the Portland   Natural Gas Transmission System (PNGTS), which begins at the northern neck of New   Hampshire and extends to the coast of Maine,   was completed. PNGTS merges with the Maritimes and Northwest Pipeline system at Wells, Maine,   where they form a joint 100-mile, 0.6 Bcf per day, natural gas pipeline that extends south through   southern New   Hampshire and terminates in northern Massachusetts (with an interconnection to the Tennessee   Gas Pipeline Company system). </p>
          <p>In   2003, PNGTS,   originally designed only to import natural gas (into New   Hampshire),   was reconfigured to provide bidirectional service to its customers. The   objective of the reconfiguration was to provide shippers of Canadian Sable Island natural gas, which use the Maritimes   &amp; Northeast Pipeline Company system,   with an opportunity to redirect some of their natural gas to markets located in Quebec (which previously had access only to western Canadian natural gas   supplies).</p>
          <p>The U.S. portion of the Maritimes   and Northeast Pipeline Company (0.8 Bcf per day) system begins at Calais, Maine,   at the Canadian border and extends to Wells, Maine.   The full 730-mile Maritimes   and Northeast Pipeline system (343 miles of which are in the U.S.) was built to access natural gas production off   the eastern coast of Canada (Sable Island)   and to transport it to New   England.   In late 2003, the Maritimes   and Northeast Pipeline Company system was extended from Dracut to Boston, Massachusetts,   providing an additional 0.2 Bcf per day of service to that metropolitan area. In 2008, its system was also expanded to transport an additional 0.4 Bcf per day of natural gas, processed at the new Canaport liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal  located in New Brunswick, Canada, to New England markets. </p>
          <p>Several   smaller regional natural gas importing pipelines, such as North   County Pipeline Company (0.6 Bcf per day) and the St.   Lawrence Gas Company (0.1 Bcf per day), both located in upper New York State, and the Vermont   Gas Systems Company (0.05 Bcf per day), the only natural gas pipeline in the State of Vermont, depend upon   Canadian natural gas imports completely for their natural gas supplies since they do not   interconnect with any other U.S. natural gas pipeline. </p> <b> </b></td> <b>
