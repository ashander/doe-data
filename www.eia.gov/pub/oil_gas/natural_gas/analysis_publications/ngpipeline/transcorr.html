          <p>The national natural   gas delivery network is intricate and expansive, but most of the major   transportation routes can be broadly categorized into 11 distinct corridors or   flow patterns. </p>
          <ul>
            <li> 5 major routes extend from the producing   areas of the Southwest</li>
            <li>   4&nbsp; routes enter the   United States from   Canada</li>
            <li>   2 originate in the   Rocky Mountain area.&nbsp; </li>
          </ul>
          <p>A summary of the major   corridors and links to details about each corridor are provided below.   &nbsp;</p>
          <p><a name="From_the_Southwest"></a><strong>Corridors   from the Southwest Region</strong> </p>
          <p>More than 20 of the   major interstate pipelines originate in the Southwest Region. Some extend to the   Southeast through Louisiana and   Arkansas, others to   the Central and Midwestern   States through   Texas, Oklahoma, and   Arkansas, and to the   Western States through New Mexico. This area   of the country exports about 45 percent (6.1 trillion cubic feet in 2007) of its   production, which is 47 percent of the total natural gas consumed elsewhere in   the lower 48 States. </p>
          <p>Pipelines exiting the   region have the capacity to accommodate as much as 45.2 &nbsp;Bcf per day: 62 percent   to the Southeast Region, 20 percent to the Central Region, 13 percent to the   Western Region, and the rest to Mexico. Much of the pipeline   capacity directed toward the Southeast traverses the region en route to   Midwestern and Northeastern markets. To a lesser degree, this is also true for   the pipeline capacity exiting to the midsection of the country, much of which is   ultimately destined for the Midwestern States.</p>

	      <p ><a name="gathering_system"></a><strong>Details about the Transportation Corridors</strong></p>
	      <p><a name="Southwest-Southeast"></a><strong>Southwest   to Southeastern   US</strong></p>
          <p>Two fairly distinct   subcorridors extend into the Southeast Region from the Southwest: one goes   eastward into Mississippi and   continues further east, and the second goes northward into Tennessee and   Kentucky. Along the   first route, five major interstate pipeline companies -- Centerpoint Energy Transmission Company, Florida Gas   Transmission Company (FGT), Gulf South Pipeline Company, Gulfstream Natural Gas System, and Southern Natural Gas Company   (SONAT) -- transport the vast majority of  natural gas that is delivered within the Southeast region.<strong> </strong>Together they can handle at least 13.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per   day for shippers in the region. </p>
          <p>Since 2006, several major transmission pipeline expansions have taken place on this route as expanding natural gas development and production in the Barnett shale and Bossier formations in east Texas has needed to find access to new markets. Centerpoint Energy Transmission Company and Gulf South Pipeline Company  have both extended and expanded their  mainline systems to reach interstate pipeline interconnections in Mississippi and Alabama, increasing capacity along this route by 3.7 Bcf/d. By 2010, three more interstate pipelines are scheduled to be built along this corridor, adding 4.2 Bcf/d. They are: Texas Gas Transmission Company's 1.1 Bcf/d Fayetteville/Greenville Laterals, the  1.7 Bcf/d Gulf Crossing Pipeline and the 1.4 Bcf/d MidContinent Express Pipeline. </p>
          <p>Varying amounts of   capacity on several other large interstate pipelines that follow this   subcorridor also serve limited markets in the region. For instance, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company   (Transco) serves customers in Georgia,   South Carolina, and   North Carolina as it   continues along its route up the east coast. However, this service only   represents about 1.1 Bcf per day, or 30&nbsp;percent, of the 3.5 Bcf per day found on   the Transco system as it enters the   region. Yet, in North Carolina it is   essentially the only source of natural gas supplies to the   State.</p>
          <p>Along the second   subcorridor, one pipeline company Texas Gas Transmission Company   (TGT) predominates, at least in terms of delivery   points.<strong> </strong>While this system extends   into the Midwest Region, more than 70 percent of its delivery points are located   in the States of Kentucky and Tennessee. TGT provides substantial deliveries to   underground storage facilities in northern Kentucky that   supplement supplies to the local market and to the Midwest Region during the   heating season. </p>
          <p>Tennessee   Gas Pipeline Company (Tenneco)<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Texas Eastern Transmission Company (TETCO)<strong> </strong>are two additional systems operating   along this subcorridor, but most of their delivery points are outside the   Southeast Region. Tenneco, however, is the principal supplier of gas to two   regional interstate pipelines: Enbridge Pipelines   (AlaTenn), mostly operating in northern   Alabama, and the East   Tennessee Gas Company (Tennessee and   Virginia).</p>
          <p>The underground storage   facilities located along this corridor are defined by their location. Those   facilities at the corridor's southern end in Louisiana,   Mississippi, and   Alabama are mainly   high-deliverability salt storage sites to support shippers and traders who want   to acquire supplies for shipment to market. Of the 11.6 Bcf of daily<strong> </strong>storage deliverability (withdrawal)   available in the area, 56 percent is from salt cavern sites. </p>
          <p>This feature provides   shippers using these corridors access to very flexible storage, which can be   used to enhance their deliverability schedule, avoid transportation imbalances,   and support any gas trading or hedging activities they may wish to engage in. In   northwestern Kentucky, along the   western subcorridor, storage facilities are devoted<strong> </strong>primarily to providing seasonal supplies.   They are supported, for the most part, by deliveries from the Texas Gas Transmission system.<strong> </strong>The majority of   the storage in Mississippi and   Alabama is   available to shippers using either subcorridor.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
          <p><strong><a name="Southwest-Northeast"></a>Southwest   to Northeastern   US</strong></p>
          <p>The   Southwest-to-Northeast corridor consists of two routes. The first extends from   East Texas and   Louisiana   northeastward through Mississippi,   Tennessee,   Kentucky, and parts   of Ohio to enter the Northeast   Region via West Virginia or   Pennsylvania. The second   route begins as the first but then extends northeastward from   Mississippi via the   east coast States and enters Virginia from the   south. The principal interstate pipeline systems operating along the corridor   include<strong> </strong>Tennessee Gas, Columbia<strong> </strong>Gulf Transmission,<strong> </strong>and Texas Eastern Transmission on   the western segment, and Transcontinental Gas   Pipeline on the eastern segment. These four pipeline   companies represent approximately 10.2 Bcf per day of total corridor capacity, making this   corridor the largest of the major transportation corridors in   North America.</p>
          <p>During wintertime peak   periods, each of the systems is almost fully utilized. During the summer months,   however, usage rates for the pipeline systems operating along this corridor tend   to drop substantially. The principal factor affecting summertime usage rates on   several of these pipeline systems is the demand for gas to refill underground   storage sites in the States of West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and, to   some degree, Ohio and   New York as well. </p>
          <p>The majority of the   more than 190 underground storage sites located along this corridor are   accessible to shippers. At the southwestern terminus of the corridor, more than   30 sites with a working gas capacity of at least 624 billion cubic feet and a   daily withdrawal capability of 13 Bcf per day are located within 20 miles of the   subject pipeline systems. Most of this capacity is used by producers, who use it   to store short-term excess production, and by market centers.</p>
          <p>This corridor links   with some of the most active trading points located outside the Southwestern   production area. One of the most significant is the Ellisburg-Leidy center in   Pennsylvania, which   provides interconnections and transportation services between the pipelines   comprising this corridor and the other major interstate pipelines operating   primarily within the Northeast States. Shippers using the corridor may also   utilize the services of several natural gas market centers to expand their   marketing and transportation options.</p>
          <p><A name="Southwest-Midwest" id="Southwest-Midwest"></A><strong>Southwest to Midwestern US</strong></p>
          <p>The Southwest-to-Midwest corridor extends northward out of East   Texas, Louisiana, and   Arkansas   (Arkoma Basin production) and   generally through Tennessee/Kentucky into the Midwest Region, although a part of   it also travels through Missouri. The   principal interstate pipeline systems operating along this corridor are: ANR   Pipeline Company (ANR), Midwestern Gas Transmission Company (via Tennessee Gas   Pipeline Company), Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL), Texas Gas   Transmission Company (TGT), Texas Eastern Transmission Company   (TETCO), and Trunkline Gas Company.   Mississippi River Gas   Transmission Pipeline Company also transports gas along   this corridor but it terminates in the St   Louis, Missouri, area. Its   operations in Illinois are   confined to the area east of St Louis. </p>
          <p>The portions of these  systems located along this corridor represent   approximately 7.8 Bcf per day, or 28&nbsp;percent of the total pipeline capacity   feeding into the Midwest Region (27.5 Bcf per day). They also account for more   than 30 percent of the total pipeline capacity exiting this area of the   Southwest.</p>
          <p>Little underground   storage is located along the midsection of this corridor. However, shippers have   access to significant amounts of storage at either end. This corridor also links   together two major gas trading centers: the Henry Hub in Louisiana and the   Chicago   Center in northern   Illinois. In   addition, the corridor also includes several natural gas trading (and price   discovery) locations accessible to shippers and traders via the several major   commercial electronic trading systems set up in the United   States and Canada. </p>
          <p>During the heating   season, these markets are actively used by shippers and other market   participants as a way to balance their receipts/deliveries, for arbitrage   between the two markets, and to smooth market and price fluctuations through   hedging.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
          <p><A name="Southwest_Panhandle-Midwest"></A><strong>Southwest Panhandle to Midwestern US</strong></p>
          <p>This route is a major   link between the Waha area (Permian   Basin) of southwestern   Texas and the   Chicago area   market. It extends from the West Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle areas northward   through the major gas production fields (including Hugoton and Panhandle)   located in southwestern Kansas, and then northeastward toward the Midwest   marketplace. In Nebraska, it links   with another corridor (see Rocky Mountain-Midwest section) bringing supplies in   from the Rocky Mountain areas of   Wyoming,   Utah, and   Colorado.</p>
          <p>There are four major   interstate pipelines that run along this corridor: ANR   Pipeline Company, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company, Northern Natural Gas   Company, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America<strong>. </strong>These four pipelines alone   constitute 67 percent of total pipeline capacity exiting this area. These   pipeline routes, however, represent only about 17&nbsp;percent of the total capacity   into the Midwest Region. The Trailblazer Pipeline   system ties in Rocky Mountain supplies   with an interconnection to Natural Gas Pipeline Company of   America in Nebraska.</p>
          <p>Market centers and   commercial trading points located in the Waha and Panhandle area of   West Texas serve this   transportation corridor at its apex. At its terminus, shippers and traders can   link their Texas trading with the   Chicago market. <A title="http://taz/ClearanceOOG/rc/htmltest/corrtext1.htm#N_2_" href="http://taz/ClearanceOOG/rc/htmltest/corrtext1.htm#N_2_"></A>In addition,   trading centers located in south central Kansas provide shippers with   the opportunity to do business with traders in the other two areas. All four   pipelines operating in the corridor have direct or indirect links with each   other.</p>
          <p>Only a limited amount   of underground storage capacity is available to transporters along this route.   However, during the nonheating season a sizeable amount of capacity on these   systems is used to transport supplies for injection into storage facilities in   Illinois,   Indiana, and   Michigan.<strong> </strong>The ANR Pipeline   system in particular has a number of open-access sites   located at the northern end of its system in Michigan. NGPL has a number of storage   sites located in Illinois.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
          <p><a name="Southwest-Western" id="Southwest-Western"></a><strong>Southwest to Western US</strong></p>
          <p>The Southwest-Western   corridor is used to transport supplies from the Permian Basin area of West   Texas, through New Mexico (where the northern route taps into the San Juan Basin   production area), and westward primarily to Arizona and California. Two major interstate   pipelines, El Paso Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline   Company, operate along this corridor. Both of these pipelines   end at the California or Nevada State borders, where they deliver supplies   to Southwest Gas Company (Nevada), Southern California Gas   Company, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric   Company, the largest pipelines serving the California   marketplace. In addition, Transwestern Gas Pipeline   Company links with the Mojave Pipeline Company, an   interstate pipeline that transports natural gas supplies to the enhanced oil   recovery (EOR) and cogeneration customers located in Kern   County, California. </p>
          <p>Joining El Paso Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline   Company along the northern route, in 2002 Questar's Southern Trails Pipeline (an oil pipeline conversion) was completed, transporting an additional 90 MMcf per day between the San Juan Basin area and the California border. </p>
          <p>Much of the natural gas   flowing along this corridor is produced in the San   Juan Basin. The TransColorado Pipeline system,   completed in 1996, can move as much as 590 MMcf per day from north central   Colorado and the   Ignacio area of the southern Colorado   San Juan   Basin to interconnections   with the El Paso Natural Gas and Transwestern   Pipeline systems in the Blanco area of northwestern   New Mexico. Northwest   Pipeline Company also can deliver up to 250 Mmcf per day into these two   systems.</p>
          <p>A significant amount of   West Texas and   New Mexico gas   supplies also are transported along the southern portion of this corridor, which   consists primarily of the El Paso Natural Gas Company's Line 2000 which has a   throughput capacity of approximately 2.4 Bcf per day. This section of the   corridor primarily serves southern Arizona and   southern California, but   in 2002 it  also began service to the new North Baja Pipeline system, designed to transport up to 500 MMcf per day to Mexico. (In 2010, the North Baja Pipeline system will become bidirectional, having the capability to transport up to 2.0 Bcf per day from LNG import facilities in Mexico to Western U.S. markets.) </p>
          <p>There is very little   underground natural gas storage capacity associated with this corridor. At the   extreme eastern end of the corridor, only one site, the Washington Ranch   facility operated by El Paso Natural Gas   Company, is reserved primarily for system support   services and is not available for customer use. At its western end, in southern   California, a limited   amount of storage capacity is available to shippers at five sites operated   by Southern California Gas Company (SoCal). </p>
          <p>Although some of the   natural gas injected into these storage sites comes from producing fields in   southern California, a   significant amount of the working gas stored at these sites comes out of this   corridor. The combined withdrawal rate capability of the four sites is 3.7   billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, while their total working gas capacity is 120   Bcf. This translates into roughly 32 days of backup from these   sites.</p>
          <p><a name="Canada-Midwest" id="Canada-Midwest"></a><strong>Western   Canada to Midwestern US<EM> </EM></strong></p>
          <p>This transportation   corridor lies between Western Canadian supply areas and the U.S. Midwest and   links two Canadian systems, TransCanada Pipeline   Ltd. and Foothills Pipeline   Company, with three United   States pipeline systems, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Company, Northern Border   Pipeline Company and Viking Gas Transmission   Company. In addition, the 1,300-mile Alliance Pipeline, completed in   late 2000, provides a direct transportation route for "wet" (natural gas high in   liquids content) between producing fields in northwestern British   Columbia and Alberta,   Canada, and a gas-processing   plant (Aux Sable) located outside Chicago,   Illinois. These   tie-ins represent about 6.2 Bcf per day of pipeline capacity, or about 41 percent of total U.S. natural gas import capacity in 2006. Between 1990 and 2006, capacity on this route  more than doubled, going from 3.1 Bcf per day in 1990 to 7.2 Bcf per day in 2006. </p>
          <p>The Northern Border   Pipeline (NBP) system extended its pipeline system to   Illinois (from it   original terminus in Iowa) in 1998 and to   Indiana in 2001,   now providing almost a Bcf per day to the Chicago area and   to customers in Indiana. In 2000,   another pipeline, the Vector Pipeline system, located between Chicago,   Illinois and Dawn,   Ontario, at the   eastern end of the corridor, was placed in service. It can transport up to one Bcf   per day between the United States   (Michigan) and   Canada (Ontario). It was   developed primarily to provide an alternative expansion route for Canadian gas   and service to customers in Ontario,   Canada. It also lies along a   route that can be expanded to potentially accommodate gas transportation of   Western Canadian gas to Northeast U.S. markets via   the Empire/Millennium gas pipeline system   that is scheduled for development in New   York State in   2008.</p>
          <p>A large number of   underground storage facilities are located in proximity to several of the   pipeline systems operating in this corridor, although not all of them are   directly accessible to shippers. For instance, nine sites (1 Bcf per day   injection, 1.8 Bcf per day withdrawal capability) are directly accessible to   shippers using the Great Lakes Gas Transmission system, while the storage facilities located in Illinois and operated   by Northern Illinois Gas Company (eight sites, 3.4 Bcf working gas capacity) are available only   through the Chicago Market Center, which is affiliated with the company, or   through the company itself. Altogether, the daily injection capability at   storage facilities linked to the receiving end of this corridor represents the   potential use of about five Bcf per day of pipeline capacity during the storage   refill period from April through October.<strong> </strong></p>
          <p><a name="Northeast" id="Northeast"></a><strong>Western   Canada to Northeastern   US</strong></p>
          <p>The western portion of   the Canada-Northeast corridor links the TransCanada Pipeline system (and Western Canadian gas production) to seven pipeline   companies in the Northeastern United   States.<strong> </strong>The seven are: Iroquois Pipeline Company, North   Country Pipeline Company, the Portland Gas Transmission System, Tennessee Gas Pipeline   Company, Empire Pipeline Company, Vermont Gas Company, and St. Lawrence Gas Company. Indirectly, the corridor also supplies gas to the National Fuel Gas Supply Company and Dominion Transmission Company. </p>
          <p>The seven systems   transport gas primarily into New York and the   New England   States at a total capacity   level of 3.4 Bcf per day. While the vast majority of the Canadian capacity that   comes into the U.S. Northeast is off the northern tier of the TransCanada system, about five percent represents capacity that traverses the U.S. Midwest (on the Great Lakes   Transmission system), crosses back into Canada through Ontario, and is imported   once again at Niagara, New York.</p>
          <p>In Canada, at the western end of   this corridor in Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces, approximately 4 Bcf per day of daily storage deliverability is   available at 12 sites interconnected with the TransCanada Pipeline System. In addition, over 25 storage sites   located at Dawn, Ontario,   Canada, are available to   shippers transporting supplies to the area via the Great Lakes Transmission system.<strong> </strong>In the U.S. Northeast, storage deliverability of up to   14.8 Bcf per day is available to these shippers.</p>
          <p><a name="Eastern-Canada" id="Eastern-Canada"></a><strong>Eastern Canada   to Northeast (New England)</strong></p>
          <p>This corridor consists   primarily of the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline system, completed in late 1999. It can transport more than 445 MMcf   per day into the United States from off the eastern   coast of Canada at Sable Island. The current system   merges with the Portland Gas Transmission System at Wells, Maine to deliver almost 628   MMcf per day in northern Massachusetts to   customers on the Tennessee Gas Pipeline system.   Beginning in 2002, with the completion of Phase III of the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline system, shippers have had the option of transporting up to 230 MMcf per day of   this capacity to the Boston, Massachusetts area on the system.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
          <p><a name="Canada-Western"></a><strong>Canada to Western US</strong></p>
          <p>The Canada-Western   route brings natural gas from Alberta and   British Columbia,   Canada, through the States of   Washington, Idaho, and Oregon, with terminating   points in Nevada and   California. In   Canada, Spectra Energy Corporation's  Westcoast Gas Transmission Ltd.<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Alberta Natural Gas Ltd. (in association with Foothills Pipeline   Ltd.) receive gas   from the TransCanada Pipeline (NOVA) in   Alberta (the   principal pipeline system in the region linked into the major production areas   in Alberta and   British Columbia) and   transport that gas to the U.S. border. There the   supplies are received by Northwest Pipeline   Company (from Westcoast Gas Transmission) and Gas   Transmission Northwest from Alberta Natural Gas<strong>. </strong>The two pipelines have a combined   capacity of 4.4 Bcf per day, 99 percent of import capacity in the area. This   route represents one-quarter of the total capacity reaching the   United States from   Canada.</p>
          <p>While the Gas Transmission   Northwest Company transports most of its gas, about 76 percent in 2006,&nbsp;directly southward to California, the Northwest Pipeline Company system   extends south and eastward from its border receipt point, operating on a   bidirectional basis along much of the eastern section.<strong> </strong>At the northern Nevada State line, Northwest Pipeline   Company links with the Paiute Pipeline   Company, which until recently was the only gas supplier   to the Reno, Nevada, area. Only one new   pipeline has been added to the corridor since 1990, the Tuscarora Pipeline   Company (110 MMcf per day) in 1995. This pipeline   interconnects with the Gas Transmission   Northwest Company system at the northern California border and   transports gas to the Reno, Nevada   area.</p>
          <p>Access to underground   storage for shippers along this corridor is limited. Much of the storage   capacity on the southern portion is owned and operated by local distribution   companies and is used exclusively to support their own seasonal storage needs.   Nevertheless, shippers can acquire access to storage services on an as-available   basis through several independent storage operations. The California Gas Transmission Company provides limited access to its three storage sites in northern   California. At the   Canadian end of the corridor, much of the available storage is intricately   linked with market center operations, providing parking and loaning services   primarily to producers shipping gas to the United   States. These Canadian sites are capable   of handling up to 6 Bcf per day deliverability and have a working gas capacity   level of about 412 Bcf.<strong> </strong></p>
          <p><a name="Rocky_Mountains-Western"></a><strong>Rocky   Mountain Area to Western US</strong></p>
          <p>This system extends   from the Opal, Wyoming area   southwestward through Nevada, just north of   Las Vegas, to   Kern County,   California. In   California, the Kern   River Pipeline system physically merges with the Mojave Pipeline system (400 MMcf   per day) to form one line serving customers primarily in Kern   and San Bernardino Counties in California. Mojave receives its supplies   from Transwestern Gas Pipeline Company and El Paso Natural Gas Company at   the Arizona-California border. Its capacity is approximately 885&nbsp;million cubic   feet per day.</p>
          <p>The Kern   River Pipeline system was developed primarily to carry   gas to the enhanced oil recovery market in southern California, which has   been a large natural gas market. In 1997, its service was extended to the   Las Vegas electric   power generation market with the opening of an expanded metering facility with   Southwest Gas Company, the major natural gas distributor in the   Las Vegas area. Its   system capacity was doubled in 2003 to approximately 1,750 MMcf/d to accommodate   the growing demand along its route.</p>
          <p>Underground storage   facilities, although available at the apex of this corridor in   Wyoming and   Utah, do not play a major   role in the operations of the Kern River Pipeline system. Although six sites are in the vicinity, with a combined daily   deliverability of 0.7 Bcf per day and 57 Bcf of working gas capacity, only one, Questar   Pipeline Company's Clay Basin facility (0.4 Bcf per day, 51   Bcf), is accessible to shippers.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
          <p><A name="Rocky_Mountains-Midwest"></A><strong>Rocky Mountain Area to Midwestern US</strong></p>
          <p>This corridor links   Rocky Mountain natural gas   supplies from Utah, Wyoming, and   Colorado with   markets in the Midwestern United States and with several sizable metropolitan   markets in eastern Kansas and   Missouri. While the   corridor itself does not yet extend into the Midwest, the   several pipelines currently operating along this route interconnect with major trunklines   that bring natural gas supplies from the Southwest Region to Midwestern markets.</p>
          <p>The Trailblazer   System, which is a contiguous linkup of the Overthrust, Wyoming Interstate<strong>, </strong>and Trailblazer pipelines, operates   from western Wyoming to eastern   Nebraska, where it   offloads to the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America pipeline. Similarly, Colorado Interstate Pipeline Company &rsquo;s Cheyenne Plains   Pipeline, built in 2004, provides more than 730 MMcf/d of gas   transportation for Wyoming and   Colorado production   from the Cheyenne Hub located in northeastern Colorado.<strong> </strong>The Cheyenne Plains   Pipeline terminates with interconnections to Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of   America in   southwestern Kansas. Natural gas transported on these pipeline systems is   subsequently delivered to customers in the eastern portion of the Central Region and in   Midwestern markets.<strong> </strong></p>
          <p>The Southern Star   Central Pipeline<STRONG><strong> </strong></STRONG>(formerly Williams Natural Gas Co &ndash;   Central) and the KM Interstate Pipeline   Company also have operations along this corridor, but   these two pipelines serve primarily local regional markets. However, the KM   Interstate Pipeline Company system does include its Pony   Express Pipeline (255 million cubic feet   per day) segment which runs from central Wyoming to south of Kansas City,   Missouri. Currently this segment does not provide any interconnections with the   two major interstate pipelines connecting this corridor to Midwestern markets;   rather, its full capacity is committed to customers located in the   Kansas City   area.</p>
          <p>In 2008, the second segment of the 1.8 Bcf/d Rockies Express Pipeline system, which will eventually comprise more than 1,660 miles and transport Rocky Mountain natural gas to Midwest and  Northeast markets, was placed in service. The first segment of the new system, completed in early 2007, involved the construction of a 327-mile pipeline system from the Meeker Hub in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, to the Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, in northeastern Colorado. Completion of the entire system, which is scheduled for early 2010, will mark the first time that Rocky Mountain natural gas supplies would be delivered directly to Midwest and Northeast markets. </p>
          <p>Customers using this   corridor have a limited number of underground storage facilities available for   their use. At the terminus of the corridor in Wyoming and   Colorado are 18   sites that customers may access. Much of the storage located at this end,   however, is used to support local producers and distribution companies. In the   Chicago area   corridor, shippers also have access to several storage facilities associated with the   Chicago market   center.<br>
