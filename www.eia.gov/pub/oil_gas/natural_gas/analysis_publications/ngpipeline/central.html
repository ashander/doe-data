            <strong>Overview<a name="overview"></a></strong>
            <br />
          <br />
          
           
            <p> Twenty-two interstate and at least thirteen intrastate natural gas pipeline companies (see   Table below) operate in the Central Region (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah,   and Wyoming). Twelve interstate natural gas pipeline systems enter the region from the south and east while   four enter from the north carrying Canadian supplies. The average utilization   rates on those shipping Canadian natural gas tend to be higher than those carrying   domestic supplies. </p>
            <p>The   region consumes less natural gas  gas than it produces (about 48 percent)   and therefore is a net exporter of natural gas. The region has several large   metropolitan markets that are major destinations on the regional interstate   natural gas pipeline network. Two of the largest are Denver, Colorado,   served by Colorado   Interstate Gas Company,   and Salt   Lake City, Utah,   which is served by Questar   Pipeline Company.   Additional markets include the Kansas   City metropolitan area of Kansas and Missouri,   served by the Southern   Star Central Gas Pipeline Company (formerly   Williams Gas Pipeline Central), KM   Interstate Gas Transmission Company,   and Panhandle   Eastern Pipeline Company systems; and the St   Louis, Missouri,   area, which is served by the Centerpoint   Mississippi River Transmission Company and Southern   Star Central Pipeline Company systems.<strong><br />
            <br />
            Transportation of Domestic Natural Gas Supplies</strong>
              <strong><a name="domestic" id="domestic"></a></strong>
              <br />
              <br />
            Several   of the largest interstate natural gas pipelines  that operate in the region retain much, if not all, of their   deliverability (capacity) for customers outside the region. For instance, the Kern   River Gas Transmission Company,   which can receive up to 1.9 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day in southwest Wyoming,   delivers more than 90 percent of its shipped volumes to destinations in Nevada and Southern   California.&nbsp; While some of this gas is consumed in the   Central Region, most of the volumes are destined for the Western Region of the   country. </p>
            <p>Even   more extreme is the U.S. portion of the Alliance   Pipeline Company system, which has only three delivery points between the location at which it   begins, the Saskatchewan/North Dakota border, and its termination point in the   vicinity of Joliet, Illinois. </p>
            <p>Likewise,   several large interstate natural gas pipelines originating in the Southwest   (West   Texas and Oklahoma panhandles) provide only limited service within the region on their way to   markets in the Midwest.   These natural gas pipeline systems flow northeastward primarily through Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa to reach Midwest natural gas markets. The two largest are the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and the Panhandle Eastern Transmission systems. The ANR Pipeline Company system follows  a similar route, but it provides greater service within the region, especially  in Iowa.</p> <b>

        <td height="142" colspan="2" valign="TOP" class="SubSection"><p>The Texas   Eastern Transmission Company system only skirts the lower southeastern corner of the region, providing   service at fewer than 15 delivery points. The Northern   Natural Gas Pipeline Company system, on the other hand, has more than 225 delivery points within the Central   Region, primarily in Iowa and Nebraska.   While it has the capability to transport 1.6 Bcf per day into the region from the   Southwest, it also receives large volumes of natural gas from interconnections   to other interstate natural gas pipelines within the region. Indeed, when the Northern   Natural Pipeline Company system exits the Central Region into the Midwest Region (Minnesota and Illinois),   its local capacity has increased to more than 2.2 Bcf per day. </p>
          <p>For   the regional interstate natural gas pipelines, the largest State-to-State capacity within   the region is Southern   Star Central Gas Pipeline Company's line from Kansas to Missouri with a capacity of 1.3 Bcf per day. However, the average usage rates on this and   similar service lines in the area are low, primarily owing to the seasonal   nature of the service: low summer time flows tend to offset the high winter   flows. In 2006, for instance, average annual utilization of Southern Star&rsquo;s   Kansas/Missouri line was only about 21 percent. </p>
          <p>In Colorado,   the Rocky   Mountain Natural Gas Company provides interconnections between natural gas producers in the western part of   the State and the TransColorado   Gas Transmission Company,   which travels southward into New   Mexico en route to the California market, through the Transwestern   Gas Company and El   Paso Natural Gas Pipeline Company systems.</p>
          <p>In addition, in 2006, the TransColorado   Gas Transmission Company installed a capability to reverse flow on its system, providing natural gas producers operating in the developing Unita/Piceance Basins of eastern Utah and western Colorado the opportunity to also transport their product eastward to the Cheyenne Hub in eastern Colorado via other regional natural gas pipelines to access transportation services to  Midwest markets. TransColorado Transmission  also  further expanded its northern flow capacity out of the San Juan Basin in southern Colorado in 2008 to give producers in that area greater access to these Midwest markets, in addition to their traditional Western regional market. </p>
          <p>Also providing transporation service out of the Unita and Piceance basins is the  western portion of the Rockies Express Pipeline system. Completed in February 2007, the 328-mile Rockies Express-Entrega system  has the capability to transport 1.5 Bcf per day of natural gas supplies from northwestern Colorado and  southwestern Wyoming to the Cheyenne Hub located in northeastern Colorado. </p>
          <p>A   major LDC in the western part of this region is Questar   Gas Company (formerly Mountain Fuel Supply Company), which serves the Salt Lake City area   and accounts for 99 percent of the receipts from interstate natural gas   pipelines operating in Utah. Questar   Pipeline Company,   an affiliate, supplies the needs of this intrastate   company.</p>
          <p>The Public   Service Company of Colorado is the major distributor of gas in Colorado,   with more end-use customers in a single State than any other company in the   region. Colorado   Interstate Gas Company provides nearly all of the gas to this LDC. </p>
          <p><strong>Exports of Expanding Coal bed and   Conventional Natural Gas Production </strong><strong><a name="imports" id="imports"></a></strong> </p>
          <p>The   expanding development of natural gas resources in Wyoming and Colorado,   especially for coal bed methane and tight-sands natural gas, has greatly   increased the amount of natural gas pipeline capacity built within and exiting   the area in recent years. Since 1999, at least seven large-capacity   header-laterals have been built in Wyoming alone, transporting natural gas from   local gathering systems to interconnections with major interstate natural gas pipelines such   as Colorado   Interstate Gas Company, Wyoming   Interstate Gas Company, Northwest   Pipeline Company, Questar   Overthrust Pipeline Company, and Questar   Pipeline Company. </p>
          <p>These    header-laterals include: the Fort   Union Gathering header   (1.3 Bcf per day), the Thunder   Creek Gathering header (0.4 Bcf per day), the Bighorn   Gas Gathering header (0.5 Bcf per day), Lost   Creek Gathering header (0.3 Bcf per day), Jonah   Gas Gathering system, (2.4 Bcf per day), and the Wyoming Interstate Pipeline   Company's Medicine-Bow lateral (1.4 Bcf per day). In addition to these  routes, several   existing intrastate natural gas pipelines have also provided support to producers needing   natural gas transportation services in the area.</p>
          <p>This   new capacity, including recent expansions to the initial lines, represents an   increase of 4.5 Bcf per day in take-away capability from the expanding Wyoming production basins. In addition, as this capacity has grown, other interstate   natural gas pipelines, such as Colorado   Interstate Gas Company, Trailblazer   Pipeline Company, TransColorado   Gas Transmission Company, and Kern   River Gas Transmission Company,   which provide transportation to more long-distance destinations, have also   increased their capabilities as well. </p>
          <p>Prior   to 2004, the Trailblazer   Pipeline Company,   which receives natural gas from the Wyoming   Interstate Company and Colorado   Interstate Gas Company systems at the Cheyenne Hub in northeastern Colorado, provided the principal transportation route for   Rocky Mountains area natural gas to reach markets in the Midwest Region (via   interconnections with Natural   Gas Pipeline Company of America and Northern   Natural Gas Company in Nebraska). In 2004, however, the Colorado Interstate Gas Company installed the Cheyenne   Plains Pipeline system (  0.8 Bcf per day) which runs from the Cheyenne hub to major interconnections in southern Kansas,   giving it the capability to deliver natural gas to other interstate systems   which have delivery points located to the east, within the Midwest Region. </p>
          <p>In addition, in early 2008, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP completed the 713-mile western portion of the Rockies Express Pipeline system which has the capability to initially transport up to 1.5 Bcf per day   of natural gas from the Cheyenne Hub to eastern Missouri. In 2009, the Rockies Express Pipeline will be extended to Ohio and  eventually to New Jersey. </p>
          <b></b>
          <p>Moreover, in recent years,  the Kern   River Gas Transmission Company and TransColorado   Gas Transmission Company have also expanded their capabilities to transport natural gas to   western markets, with substantial increases in capacity from   Utah and Nevada (Kern   River Transmission Company,   1.8 Bcf per day) and the <A title="You will be leaving the EIA.DOE.GOV domain and entering an external link.

          <p>In   addition, several existing intrastate natural gas pipelines have provided support to   producers needing natural gas transportation services out of the Rocky   Mountains production areas. In Wyoming,   these include the Overland   Trails Pipeline Company system, which interconnects with the Questar   Overthrust Pipeline Company and   the Questar   Pipeline Company systems in western Wyoming,   and the MIGC   and MGTC Pipeline Company systems which link the production fields in northeast Wyoming with the KM   Interstate Gas Transmission Company system which, in turn, provides transportation southeastward into Nebraska. New expansion capacity planned over the next several years in the Rocky Mountain area will support  much of the  growing natural   gas production out in the area, primarily directing it to the Cheyenne Hub located in   northeast Colorado.   </p>

  &nbsp;Trunk - systems are large-diameter long-distance trunklines that generally tie supply   areas to natural gas market areas. <br />
  &nbsp;Grid -  systems are usually a network of many interconnections and delivery   points that operate in and serve major natural gas market areas.<br />
