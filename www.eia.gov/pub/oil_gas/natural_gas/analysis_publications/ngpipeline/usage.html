            <strong>Overview   of Pipeline Utilization</strong></p>
          <p>Natural gas pipeline   companies prefer to operate their systems as close to full capacity as possible   to maximize their revenues. However, the average utilization rate (flow   relative to design capacity) of a natural gas pipeline system seldom   reaches 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Factors that contribute to outages include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scheduled   or unscheduled maintenance</li>
            <li>Temporary   decreases in market demand</li>
            <li>Weather-related   limitations to operations </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most   companies try to schedule maintenance in the summer months when demands on   pipeline capacity tend to be lower, but an occasional unanticipated incident   may occur that suspends transmission service. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><a name="domestic"></a><strong>Utilization   Rates</strong></p>
          <p>Utilization   rates below 100% do not necessarily imply that additional capacity is available   for use.&nbsp; A pipeline company that primarily serves a seasonal market, for   instance, may have a relatively low average utilization rate especially during   the summer months. But that does not mean there is unreserved capacity on a   long-term basis.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>On the   other hand, during periods of high demand for natural gas transportation   services, usage on some portions of a pipeline system may exceed 100% of   certificated capacity.&nbsp; Certificated capacity represents a minimum level of   service that can be maintained over an extended period of time, and not    the maximum throughput capability of a system or segment on any given   day.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Exceeding   100% of capacity is accomplished by secondary compression and/or line packing,   which means that compression is increased, within safety limits, to raise   throughput temporarily. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><a name="imports"></a><strong>Integration   of Storage Capacity</strong></p>
          <p>Integrating   storage capacity into the natural gas pipeline network design can increase average-day   utilization rates. &nbsp;This integration involves moving not only natural gas currently   being produced but natural gas that has been produced earlier and kept in temporary   storage facilities.</p></td>

		Storage is   usually integrated into or available to the system at the production and/or   consuming end as a means of balancing flow levels throughout the year.&nbsp;   Trunklines serving markets with significant storage capacity have greater   potential for achieving a high utilization rate because the load moving on these   pipelines can be leveled. &nbsp;To the extent that these pipelines serve multiple   markets, they also can achieve higher utilization rates because of the load   diversity of the markets they serve.&nbsp;<p></p>
          <p><a name="companies"></a><strong>Varying   Rates of Utilization</strong></p>
          <p>Trunklines,   which are generally upstream (closer to) the natural gas production fields and   storage areas, may sometimes exhibit peak period utilization rates exceeding 100% because they   are occasionally   capable of handling much larger volumes than indicated by the operational   design certificated by FERC. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Utilization   on the grid systems, which are closer to the consuming market areas and   downstream of the storage fields, is more likely to reflect a seasonal load   profile of the market being served. &nbsp;The grid-type systems usually operate at   lower average utilization levels than trunklines and usually show marked   variation between high and low flow levels, reflecting seasonal service and   local market characteristics.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><a name="domestix"></a><strong>Measures   of Pipeline Utilization&nbsp; </strong></p>
          <p>There are several ways that natural gas pipeline system utilization may be estimated, as demonstrated in the following cases: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>As a measure of the average-day natural gas throughput relative to estimates of   system capacity at State and regional boundaries &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The   systemwide pipeline flow rate, which highlights variations in system usage   relative to an estimated system peak throughput level </li>
            <li>A system   peak-day usage rate, which generally reflects peak system deliveries relative to   estimated system capacity&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The latter measure is a good indication of how  well the design of the system matches current shipper peak-day needs. For  example, when a pipeline shows a comparatively low average usage rate (based on  annual or monthly data) yet shows a usage rate approaching 100 percent on its  peak day, it indicates that the system is called upon and is capable of meeting  its shipper's maximum daily needs. Nevertheless, a large spread between average  usage rates and peak-day usage rates may indicate opportunities to find better  ways to utilize off-peak unused capacity. </p>
        <p>In some cases, utilization rates exceeding 100 percent may be an  artifact of the data that obscures the true operational status of the pipeline. </a>In some instances the  sum of individual transportation transactions may exceed pipeline capacity even  though physically the pipeline may not be full. For example, suppose a segment  from points A to D (with points B and C between A and D) has a capacity of 200  million cubic feet (MMcf) per day. Suppose further that this segment handles a  100 MMcf per day transaction from A to B, a second of 100 MMcf per day from B  to C, and a third of 100 MMcf per day from C to D. The pipeline company will  report transportation volumes of 300 MMcf per day, even though its capacity is  200 MMcf per day but is only 50 percent utilized on any one segment. </p>
