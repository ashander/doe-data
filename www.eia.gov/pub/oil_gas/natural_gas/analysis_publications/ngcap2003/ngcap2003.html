      Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      This analysis examines the availability of effective productive capacity 
      to meet the projected wellhead demand for natural gas through 2003. <i>Effective 
      productive capacity</i> is defined as the maximum production available from 
      natural gas wells considering limitations of the production, gathering, 
      and transportation systems. Surplus or unutilized capacity is the difference 
      between the effective productive capacity and the actual production. This 
      report contains projections of natural gas effective productive capacity 
      in the Lower-48 States for 2003 and is based on prices and production forecasts 
      in EIA's February 2003 <i>Short Term Energy Outlook</i> (STEO).<br>
      <br>
      The analysis projects an average surplus capacity of 5.6 Bcf/d in 2003 under 
      STEO Base case conditions, indicating that projected demand for natural 
      gas in that scenario can be met (Figure ES-1, Table ES-1). However, the 
      relatively narrow margin of surplus capacity - roughly 10 percent of the 
      projected 51.4 Bcf/d average production rate in 2003 - limits the available 
      production response to any sudden demand increase or drop in production 
      because of severe weather or other event. Withdrawals of stored natural 
      gas can respond to such problems, just as they are regularly used during 
      peak winter periods when daily natural gas demand can be more than 1.5 times 
      daily production. Nonetheless, the narrow surplus margin indicates a significant 
      potential for short-term price increases in the event such contingencies 
      occur.<br>
      <br>
      Maintaining or increasing gas well drilling is critical to maintaining or 
      increasing gas productive capacity. About 25 percent of estimated wellhead 
      capacity is from wells one year old or less. The two largest supply areas, 
      Texas and the Gulf of Mexico, which together produce about 50 percent of 
      the nation's total gas production, also have the highest percentage of capacity 
      from wells one year old or less at 30 percent. If drilling were to stop 
      completely, all surplus or unutilized wellhead capacity would vanish in 
      less than a year.<br>
      <br>
      Recent trends in productive capacity have closely tracked the number of 
      well completions. The year 2001 had a large increase in completions, reaching 
      22,800 and capacity increased. There were only 17,000 well completions in 
      2002, a large drop, and productive capacity declined. A large increase in 
      completions is projected for 2003, about the same increase as in 2001, and 
      effective productive capacity is projected to increase by about 2 Bcf/d.<br>
      <br>
      Fifty six percent of the expected 2003 increase in well completions is forecast 
      to occur in Texas and the Rocky Mountain Area. Rocky Mountain well completion 
      increases are largely due to coal bed methane drilling in the Powder River 
      Basin.<br>
      <br>
      The Rocky Mountain area is projected to have the largest estimated surplus 
      capacity in 2003 at 1.4 Bcf/d followed by Texas with 1.3 Bcf/d, New Mexico 
      at 0.5 Bcf/d, and Oklahoma at 0.4 Bcf/d. Estimated surplus capacity in the 
      rest of the Lower-48 States and Gulf of Mexico is roughly 2.0 Bcf/d. While 
      the Lower-48 States taken together are likely to have a small surplus or 
      unutilized capacity, specific areas may have little or none. Because of 
      the limitations in the transportation network, surplus capacity in one area 
      may not be available to all other areas.<br>
      <br>
      Because of exceptional growth in well completions in the Rocky Mountain 
      Area, growth in effective productive capacity in that region is expected 
      to be limited in the short term by a slower growth rate of the delivery 
      infrastructure. Based on historical experience, infrastructure capacity 
      was assumed to grow at approximately 1/3 the wellhead productive capacity 
      growth rate. This limitation reduces estimated Rocky Mountain surplus or 
      unutilized capacity in 2003 from 2.7 to 1.4 Bcf/d.<br>
      <br>
      In 2003, the forecast indicates that Gulf of Mexico production will be limited 
      by effective productive capacity. Lower drilling rates in the Gulf are the 
      cause of the expected loss of surplus effective capacity. However, deep 
      water prospects now being developed appear to produce at higher rates than 
      completions in the recent past. Future completions in the study are modeled 
      after recent past completions. Therefore, if the new wells are sufficiently 
      more productive, some of the declining capacity indicated in this study 
      could be alleviated. Adding to pipeline infrastructure could also increase 
      effective productive capacity in the Gulf.<br>

      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>An important issue facing the U.S. natural gas markets is whether 
          or not natural gas production will rise to meet expected growth in demand. 
          However, lags of several months in the availability of natural gas production 
          data, and the fact that production data tends to be revised upward over 
          time, leaves considerable uncertainty regarding the supply response 
          resulting from current drilling levels. </li>
        <li>This assessment attempts to estimate the natural gas productive capacity 
          that should be expected given recent natural gas drilling and price 
          trends.</li>
        <li>This report contains projections of natural gas effective productive 
          capacity in the Lower-48 States for 2003. The effective productive capacity 
          is an upper limit on the amount of natural gas that could be produced 
          in 2003 by region and by month.</li>
        <li> Until 2001, EIA made these projections by summing the maximum measured 
          monthly production rates of each well in each year (wellhead capacity), 
          tacitly assuming that all wells could produce maximally at the same 
          time. However, a review of the historical data showed that all wells 
          cannot produce at their wellhead capacity at the same time, mainly because: 
          <ul>
            <li> Field processing equipment has limitations that prevent handling 
              the maximum wellhead capacity production of every well concurrently. 
            </li>
            <li> Some gathering and pipeline systems cannot handle peak wellhead 
              capacity production from all wells concurrently within certain geographical 
              areas. </li>
            <li> Compression capabilities may be less than the peak wellhead capacity. 
            </li>
            <li> Some natural gas plant throughput capabilities are lower than 
              peak wellhead capacities. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Since 2001, EIA has calculated an effective productive capacity, 
          which better reflects the ability of producing wells to deliver gas 
          into the gathering and transportation system. Projections from this 
          methodology will not be exact but are within reasonable accuracy to 
          provide a better indication of surplus or unutilized effective productive 
          capacity. </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Recent History</b><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li> Lower oil and gas prices in 1998 and early 1999 resulted in reduced 
          gas rig counts, reduced new gas well completions, and a decline in capacity. 
          This increased the effective productive capacity utilization rate to 
          between 90 and 92 percent (8 to 10 percent surplus capacity). The anomalous 
          data in September 1998 is the result of production being shut in for 
          hurricanes (Figure ES1). </li>
        <p align="center"> <img align="middle" src="images/image003.gif" width="577" height="395" alt="Figure 1. Lower-48 States Effective Capacity Utilization and Gas Price (1987-2001)" border="0"><br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <li> Capacity utilization rates above 90 percent create the potential 
          for higher natural gas prices. Figure 1 shows that monthly average wellhead 
          natural gas prices have stayed below $3.00 per Mcf whenever capacity 
          utilization remains below 90 percent. Capacity utilization rates above 
          90 percent are consistent with a much wider range of prices. </li>
        <li> Supply tightness, along with low gas storage levels and higher demand, 
          created the conditions for the rising prices realized in 2000 and early 
          in 2001 (Figure 2). These higher prices stimulated drilling and increased 
          gas completions to approximately 2020 completions per month in mid-2001 
          with over 1000 rigs searching for gas and increasing capacity in 2001. 
        </li>
        <li> The increasing capacity through 2001, in turn, caused the capacity 
          utilization to drop to about 90 percent and lessen the potential for 
          high prices. The Lower-48 average gas price declined from a January 
          2001 high of $8.16 to a low of $2.17 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 
          February 2002. </li>
        <li> Declining prices reduced gas completions to 17,000 in 2002. The gas 
          rig count dropped to approximately 600. The previous report, "Natural 
          Gas Productive Capacity for the Lower-48 States" May 2001, anticipated 
          this trend. The decrease in gas prices, drilling, and completions in 
          late 2001 and early 2002 caused a decrease in productive capacity in 
          early 2002. </li>
        <li> Monthly natural gas prices returned to the $3.00 per Mcf range in 
          April 2002 and are expected to peak in February 2003 at $4.74 per Mcf 
          before stabilizing in the range of $3.90 to $4.28 per Mcf for the remainder 
          of 2003 (Table 1). Gas completions are expected to increase to 2000 
          per month by November 2003 with a gas rig count of 970 (Base Case) (Figure 
          2). Capacity began to increase in mid-2002 and continues to increase 
          as gas prices and completions remain at high rates relative to recent 
          historical rates. The effective capacity utilization is projected to 
          remain at or above 90 percent through most of 2003 (Base Case) indicating 
          that sudden changes in demand or supply such as severe cold weather 
          or storms that require wells to be shut in could cause short term shortages 
          and high prices until the gas system adjusts. </li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <b>Methodology</b><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li> The effective productive capacity is the estimated maximum production 
          available for use from natural gas wells. It is a demonstrated limit 
          that is lower than the wellhead capacity. It reflects the ability of 
          producing wells to deliver gas into the gathering and transportation 
          system. </li>
        <li> To estimate the effective productive capacity, the wellhead productive 
          capacity must first be estimated for all wells. The monthly wellhead 
          capacity projections are the sum of capacity forecasts for older wells 
          and new wells. </li>
        <ul>
          <li> To estimate old well capacity, the wells are grouped by vintage 
            year. Productive capacity is modeled for each vintage using a hyperbolic 
            function relating the peak monthly production rates to cumulative 
            production. A monthly projection is made for each vintage and then 
            all vintages are summed. </li>
          <li> In areas that have significant coal bed methane production after 
            1987, the coal bed wells and their respective production history are 
            summarized by vintage. A growth curve relating the average production 
            rate per well to the cumulative production per well and a separate 
            decline curve are fit to the data and merged at the peak rate. </li>
          <li> New well capacity is a function of the number of new well completions, 
            which depends on the monthly drilling rig forecast based on the monthly 
            price and production forecasts in EIA's <i>Short Term Energy Outlook</i> 
            (STEO). </li>
          <ul>
            <li> The Drilling Rig Model uses oil and gas revenue to project total 
              active rigs and the percent of rigs drilling for gas. A <i>well 
              completion/rig ratio</i> for each of the ten U.S. supply areas is 
              used to convert the number of gas rigs to well completions. This 
              conversion includes an efficiency factor that models the efficiency 
              losses normally seen when the number of drilling rigs increases. 
            </li>
            <li> The wellhead capacity to produce gas from these new well completions 
              is estimated by an average growth curve for the first 12 months, 
              and a hyperbolic function relating monthly production rate to cumulative 
              production and calibrated to the most recent 3 years of data for 
              conventional wells. New coal bed methane wells use an average growth 
              curve and decline rate as determined by the last 3 data years. </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li> The <i>effective capacity utilization</i> rate is the ratio of the 
          <i>production</i> to the <i>effective productive capacity</i>. </li>
        <li> The production forecast is based on the U.S. production forecast 
          in the most recent STEO. </li>
        <ul>
          <li> The U.S. production forecast is distributed among the ten supply 
            areas considered in this study according to each area's monthly share 
            of production during the past two years. </li>
          <li> Each area's effective productive capacity is then compared to its 
            monthly production forecast. If the area's production forecast is 
            greater than the estimated effective productive capacity, the unmet 
            production requirement is allocated to other supply areas that have 
            surplus or unutilized effective productive capacity. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> <i>Surplus</i> (unutilized) <i>capacity</i> is defined as the difference 
          between the estimated <i>effective productive capacity</i> and the projected 
          <i>production</i>. </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Note: </b> This study uses average monthly values, which do not reflect 
      phenomena - such as a severe cold snap - that might push production to full 
      capacity (100% utilization rate) for a short time. Monthly peak winter natural 
      gas demand is usually 1.5 times or greater than natural gas production; 
      the deficit is met by withdrawals from natural gas storage and imports. 
      Potential uncertainties of up to several percent may exist in some monthly 
      production and effective productive capacity estimates used in this study.

        <ul>
          <li> Average effective productive capacity is expected to exceed production 
            by 5.6 Bcf/d in 2003 in the Lower-48 States (Base Case). Average production 
            for 2003 is projected to be 51.4 Bcf/d (Figure 4a). However, the Low 
            Case shows the capacity difference becoming smaller by the end of 
            2003 when compared to the Base Case production. </li>
          <li> Maintaining gas well drilling is critical to maintaining gas productive 
            capacity. The 17,000 gas well completions in 2002 were not quite enough 
            to replace the capacity decline from all the older wells producing 
            at the end of 2001. The effective productive capacity declined about 
            1.5 Bcf/d in 2002. Completions are projected to increase by 5,800 
            in 2003 to about the same level as in 2001. Effective productive capacity 
            is projected to increase about 2 Bcf/d in 2003. </li>
          <li> Effective capacity utilization is at or above 90 percent for most 
            of 2003 in the Base Case. </li>

          </p>
          <li> The number of gas well completions added each year has increased 
            from 13,000 - 14,000 per year prior to year 2000 to 22,800 in 2001. 
            Completions added in 2002 decreased to 17,000 but are expected to 
            increase to the 22,800 level again in 2003 (Base Case). The majority 
            of the increase is in Texas and the Rocky Mountain area (Figure 4b).

          <li> Completions that are one year old or less contribute 25 to 30 percent 
            of the total wellhead capacity and completions three years old or 
            less contribute slightly more than 50 percent of the total wellhead 
            capacity (Figure 4c). One reason for higher percentages of production 
            capacity from new wells is improved completion technology that allows 
            high rates of production (and therefore higher depletion rates) from 
            new wells. If drilling were to stop completely, all surplus wellhead 
            capacity would vanish in less than a year. </li>

            of gas at 13 - 14 Bcf/d. Production is at 95 to100 percent of effective 
            capacity and has been at 90 to 95 percent since 1993 (Figure 5a). 
          </li>
          <li> The difference between wellhead capacity and effective capacity 
            is large because of infrastructure limitations. Small changes in infrastructure 
            such as pipeline or processing improvements could result in significant 
            improvement in effective capacity. </li>
          <li> Current surplus capacity of approximately 0.5 to 0.8 Bcf/d is expected 
            to decline to 0.24 Bcf/d in 2003 because of a projected decrease in 
            drilling. </li>

          <li> Louisiana is a mature area. Recent drilling is able to develop 
            sufficient new capacity to maintain production at the present level 
            and to add a small surplus capacity of 0.16 Bcf/d in 2003. </li>

          <li> An increase of gas well completions to approximately 750 is projected

            surplus of 0.16 Bcf/d in 2003 (Figure 8b) but to increase capacity 
            and production significantly, an additional increase in completions

        <li> Rocky Mountain Area </li>
        <ul>
          <li> The Rocky Mountain Area gas production has increased from 4 billion 
            cubic feet in the mid-1990's to the current rate of 6 Bcf/d with much 
            of the increase coming from coal bed methane. </li>
          <li> Current conventional and coal bed production of 6 billion cubic 
            feet per day is expected to be maintained through 2003 with coal bed 
            methane production expected to increase to 2.3 Bcf/day by 2003 from 
            an average of 1.9 Bcf/d in 2002. </li>
          <li> In the Rocky Mountain Area wellhead capacity is growing at a faster 
            rate than the infrastructure. Therefore, the effective capacity growth 
            is assumed to be one-third of the wellhead capacity growth rate resulting 
            in a surplus or unutilized capacity of 1.4 Bcf/d rather than 2.7 Bcf/d 
            in 2003. </li>
          <li> Additional pipeline capacity is expected to alleviate the infrastructure 
            limitations (Figure 12a). </li>

          <li> Gas well completions in the Rocky Mountain area have increased

            2002 an increase to 6,550 is expected in 2003. Most of the increase 
            was in the number of coal bed wells completed (Figure 12b). </li>

      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li> Average surplus or unutilized capacity (the difference between expected 
          effective productive capacity based on model forecasts of rigs drilling 
          for gas and forecast production demand from the February 2003 <i>Short 
          Term Energy Outlook</i> for the Lower-48 States) is projected to be 
          5.6 Bcf/d through 2003 (Table 2). Estimated effective productive capacity 
          is therefore expected to be sufficient to meet the forecasted demand 
          for gas during 2003. </li>
        <li> The projected 2003 Base Case surplus of 5.6 Bcf/d is 10 percent of 
          the projected production rate of 51.4 Bcf/d. This is relatively small 
          compared to the surplus margin between 1985 and 1995 but is similar 
          to the period 1996 to 1999. </li>
        <li> The high utilization of effective productive capacity indicates market 
          supply is relatively tight with a potential for short-term price increases 
          should there be a sudden increase in demand or drop in production because 
          of severe weather or other problems. </li>
        <li> The gas well completions in 2002 were sufficient to maintain production 
          but effective capacity declined. Increased completions in 2003 by 5,800 
          to 2001 levels are expected to increase effective capacity about 2 Bcf/d 
          through 2003. </li>
        <li> Due to infrastructure limitations, available surplus in the Rocky 
          Mountain Area is estimated to be 1.4 Bcf/d, notwithstanding the rapid 
          development of coal-bed methane resources. Absent such limitations, 
          the estimated effective surplus would be 2.7 Bcf/d. </li>
        <li> Texas estimated surplus capacity of 1.32 Bcf/d is exceeded by the 
          infrastructure limited Rocky Mountain area surplus of 1.4 Bcf/d in 2003 
          and is the largest estimated unutilized capacity. </li>
        <li> Anticipated reduction in drilling in the Gulf of Mexico will cause 
          its effective productive capacity utilization rate to approach 100 percent 
          in 2003. </li>
        <li> Additional uncertainty surrounds the estimates for effective productive 
          capacity in the Gulf of Mexico and Rocky Mountain Areas. The possible 
          development of high rate completions in the deep water or deep shelf 
          area of the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico and the completion of gas 
          pipelines in the Rocky Mountain Area and Gulf of Mexico could increase 
          effective capacity more than accounted for in the current estimates. 
        </li>
        <li> Completions that are one year old or less contribute approximately 
          25 percent of the total wellhead capacity. </li>
        <li> Two year old or less completions contribute 40 percent of total wellhead 
          capacity. </li>
        <li> Three year old or less completions contribute slightly more than 
          one half of the total wellhead capacity. </li>
