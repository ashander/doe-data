      <p>Despite a national economic slowdown and a 4.9 percent drop in overall 
        U.S. natural gas consumption in 2001,<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN1">(1)</a> more than 3,571 miles of pipeline 
        and a record 12.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas pipeline 
        capacity were added to the national pipeline network during 2002 (Table 
        1). The estimated cost was $4.4 billion. <br>
         </p>
      Overall, 54 natural gas pipeline projects were completed during 2002 (Figure 
      1, Table 2).<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN2">(2)</a> Of these, 34 were expansions of existing pipeline systems 
      or segments (see Box, &quot;Gas Pipeline Capacity Development&quot;). The 
      other 20 included 9 new pipeline systems, 3 new gathering (header) systems, 
      and 8 new large laterals that extend from existing pipeline systems. Expansions 
      to existing systems added 6.9 Bcf/d to overall capacity, while new pipelines/laterals 
      added 5.9 Bcf/d. </font> 
      <p></p>
      <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">Over the past three 
      years, the annual level of natural gas pipeline capacity additions (Table 
      1) has grown steadily, a trend that has been maintained since the early 
      1990s.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN3">(3)</a> While the current inventory of proposed additions for 2003 and for 
      2004-2005 indicates a continuing increase in the rate of annual capacity 
      additions, there are indications that these levels will probably not be 
      fully realized. Indeed, signs point to a drop in the rate of new capacity 
      additions over the next several years or at least to their number leveling 
      off.</font> <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><br>
	  
      <p>Since late 2001, many of the market factors that helped fuel the large growth in new pipeline capacity additions have changed significantly. For instance, economic growth has slowed and many proposals to add new gas-fired electric generation capacity have been delayed or canceled.  As a result, the need for new natural gas capacity has also weakened.

        <img align="middle" src="images/gaspipedev.gif" width=654 height=667 alt="Gas Pipeline Capacity Development      need for new or additional pipeline capacity to satisfy a growing 
              demand for natural gas can be met in several ways: build and entirely 
              new pipeline; convert an oil or product pipeline; or expand an existing 
              natural gas pipeline system. Building an entirely new pipeline system 
              involves many more cost factors than the latter two methods; new 
              rights of ways must be acquired, new compressor stations must be 
              built, and an extensive new receipt, delivery and interconnect infrastructure 
              must be incorporated.
              
              Expanding or converting an existing system, on the other hand, is 
              less expensive since it only involves modifying or adding to a portion 
              of a pipeline system, such as laying a new parallel pipeline (looping), 
              replacing old pipe with larger diameter pipe, adding a new compressor 
              station/unit, or upgrading an existing compressor station/unit. 
              Constructing an extension from the terminus of an existing pipeline 
              system, or constructing a large lateral to, or from, an existing 
              mainline system, will reflect characteristics of both an expansion 
              and new pipeline project. Usually, while no new compressor stations 
              may be required, routing has to be optimized and rights-of-way have 
              to be acquired. Moreover, when a large lateral/extension is constructed, 
              the mainline pipeline itself may have to be expanded, perhaps as 
              far back as the original source of supply.
              
              Because each pipeline project has its own unique profile, it is 
              difficult to develop a comparison of pipeline capacity development 
              based on any combined measures of cost, mileage, and capacity. Indeed, 
              most pipeline projects are a mix of development/expansion methods. 
              Nevertheless, for purposes of this review, the design daily throughput 
              is used as the common unit of measurement. Further, each project 
              has been categorized according to what appears to be the bulk of 
              the overall effort involved, i.e., adding compression, and new pipe 
              (looping), building a new lateral, or building and entirely new 
              pipeline system." border="0"><br>

      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">The deteriorating 
        financial condition of a number of energy companies over the past year 
        and the cessation of gas trading as a line of business by a number of 
        others have caused some pipeline company subsidiaries to re-evaluate their 
        commitment to specific pipeline expansion proposals. And, since a number 
        of expansion proposals have been predicated upon the building of new gas-fired 
        electric power plants, a number of which have been suspended, postponed, 
        or canceled, the cancellation of related pipeline laterals and even some 
        long-haul transmission projects might be anticipated also. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">The need for new 
        import pipeline capacity from Canada also appears to have reached a temporary 
        plateau. Since 2000, only 207 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of new 
        import pipeline capacity (Table 2) has been added (into the Western region) 
        and a proposed 163 MMcf/d import capacity expansion to the Western region 
        was recently canceled. Moreover, no additional new projects have been 
        proposed to increase import capacity from Canada into the Midwest or Central 
        regions through 2005. Import capacity development into the Northeast region, 
        however, is a potential exception to the trend. Six import expansion proposals 
        have been announced, with a combined increase of 2,109 MMcf/d of capacity 
        through 2005. For the most part, this new capacity is slated to support 
        new and proposed gas-fired power plants in the Boston and New York metropolitan 
        areas. </font></p>

      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><b>Overview/Trends</b><br>
        <b><br>
        Five major new natural gas pipeline systems were completed and placed 
        in operation during 2002</b> (Figure 2). They were: Gulfstream Pipeline, 
        1,130 MMcf/d-560 miles, which carries natural gas under the Gulf of Mexico 
        from gas-processing facilities located on the gulf coasts of the States 
        of Mississippi and Alabama to west central Florida; North Baja Pipeline, 
        500 MMcf/d-80 miles (in U.S.), which exports gas to electric power plants 
        located in Baja California, Mexico; Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, 
        87 MMcf/d-405 miles, which transports gas from the four-corners area of 
        New Mexico/Utah (San Juan Basin) to the California/Arizona border area; 
        and the Guardian, 750 MMcf/d-142 miles, and Horizon, 380 MMcf/d-29 miles, 
        pipelines, which expanded the flow of gas supplies between the Chicago 
        (Illinois) hub and the growing market of northern Illinois and southern 
        Wisconsin. Completion of these five pipelines accounted for 22 percent 
        of all new natural gas pipeline capacity installed in the United States 
        in 2002 and 34 percent of the total new gas pipeline mileage.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><b><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">A number of major short-haul, 
	  though large-capacity, pipeline laterals 
        were constructed </b>and placed in operation in 2002 (Table 2, Figure 
        1). Most of these pipeline segments were built to connect existing pipeline 
        systems to new gas-fired electric power generation plants. Twelve such 
        lines, totaling 303 miles, accounted for 3,280 MMcf/d, or 26 percent, 
        of the total new natural gas pipeline capacity added to the network in 
        2002. An undetermined number of smaller pipeline laterals that were constructed 
        to supply new gas-fired power plants were also placed in service in 2002. 
        However, their interconnections with the existing natural gas pipeline 
        system were nearby and the cost of their construction fell below the blanket 
        certificate threshold ($7.5 million)<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN4">(4)</a> for needing FERC or other regulatory 
        approval for construction. Such projects are normally carried out under 
        blanket certificate authority.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN5">(5)</a> <br>

        <br>
      </p>
		
		
      <b>Ten major pipeline project proposals were canceled during the year. </b>The 
      canceled projects, representing 4,827 MMcf/d of potential capacity and 1,450 
      miles of pipeline, initially were scheduled to be placed in service between 
      2002 and 2004. In most instances, changed market conditions were cited by 
      the project sponsors as the reason for the cancellations.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN6">(6)</a> The most prominent 
      of those canceled was the Independence Pipeline project (1,000 MMcf/d-400 
      miles), and the associated ANR Supply Link project (750 MMcf/d-73 miles), 
      which would have created a new transportation corridor from the Chicago, 
      Illinois, area to eastern Pennsylvania (Leidy area). Although finally approved 
      by FERC in 2000 (initially filed in 1996), the Independence project was 
      dropped by its sponsor, with a lack of current and future market support 
      cited as a reason. <br>
      <b><br>
      The Southeast and Western regions had the largest increase in natural gas 
      pipeline capacity in 2002.</b> The installation of the Gulfstream Pipeline 
      system and the completion of a 478 MMcf/d expansion of the Florida Gas Transmission 
      system in the Southeast contributed to making that region the leader in 
      new natural gas pipeline capacity (3,056 MMcf/d), added miles of pipe (915), 
      and total expenditures ($1.8 billion) (Table 2). Yet, the rapid installation 
      of new pipeline capacity in the Western region, in response to the 2000-2001 
      energy crisis in that region, resulted in new capacity additions of 2,852 
      MMcf/d, closely approximating those seen in the Southeast region. However, 
      expenditures were less than half that of the Southeast region, $0.8 billion, 
      primarily because 5 of the 12 completed projects were short-haul laterals 
      that supported new gas-fired electric power plants, and 4 were relatively 
      less expensive compression or looping projects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Southwest region had the smallest amount of added capacity because 
      of a temporary drop in deepwater pipeline development in the Gulf of Mexico.</b> 
      In 2002, the Southwest region saw a 59-percent decrease in added capacity, 
      882 MMcf/d versus 2,157 MMcf/d in 2001, following several years of expansion 
      activity (Table 1). Another reason for the low growth level was the relative 
      small size and number of completed onshore expansion projects, owing to 
      slower growth in both regional gas production and regional gas demand. <br>

        <b>Major transfers of pipeline assets occurred in 2002</b> as the financial 
        problems of many parent companies of natural gas pipeline companies deepened. 
        Several of them found it necessary to sell natural gas pipeline assets 
        that they had purchased over the past decade as part of efforts to build 
        a national or regional transportation network in support of trading operations 
        (Table 3).<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN7">(7)</a> For example, The Williams Companies, Inc., sold its Kern River 
        Transmission System (a key transporter of Wyoming natural gas to California) 
        to MidAmerican Energy Holdings, Inc. The Williams Companies also sold 
        its Williams Gas Pipeline Central Company (a major regional pipeline system 
        with operations in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma) to Southern Star Central 
        Corporation, and its Cove Point LNG facilities and pipeline to Dominion 
        Resources, Inc. Financial difficulties also forced Dynegy Inc. to sell 
        the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline (which it had acquired from bankrupt 
        Enron Corporation in 2001) to MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Growth in the National Network</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">At the close of 2002, the 
	  85 companies that make up the U.S. interstate 
        natural gas mainline transportation network operated about 212,000 miles 
        of pipeline and had the capability to deliver more than 133 Bcf/d of gas 
        (Table 3).<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN8">(8)</a> This represented a 2-percent increase in mileage from the 
        2001 level and an 11-percent increase in interstate pipeline capacity. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Compared with 2001, the installation of new natural gas pipeline capacity 
        was up 39 percent, with construction expenditures up 161 percent (Table 
        1). In part, this sizeable expansion reflected the quick industry response 
        to the energy crises in the Western region in late 2000 and early 2001, 
        and the growing demand for additional natural gas service in the Southeast 
        region. In 2002, more new natural gas pipeline capacity was added to the 
        Western regional network than had been installed during any one year of 
        the previous decade, as the region's interstate pipeline companies increased 
        their capabilities to deliver gas to California. In addition, the two 
        major California intrastate pipelines increased their capability to receive 
        gas from the interstate system and to deliver that gas to their respective 
        service territories.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">Interstate natural 
        gas pipeline capacity into California has increased by 10 percent since 
        2000, much of it added in 2002 (Figure 3, Table 2). Among the 2002 projects 
        contributing to this growth were a 207 MMcf/d expansion of the PG&amp;E 
        Gas Transmission-Northwest pipeline between California and Canada and 
        a 230 MMcf/d expansion of the El Paso Natural Gas Company's South System 
        in New Mexico and Arizona (Table 2). <br>
        <br>
        Gas pipeline capacity from Wyoming's Power River Basin and other areas 
        in the State increased by 19 percent between 2000 and 2002 (Figure 3). 
        One of the most important expansion projects completed during 2002 in 
        the Central region was the 324 MMcf/d expansion of the Trailblazer Pipeline 
        system (from 522 MMcf/d previously). With the completion of this project 
        (Table 2), gas transportation between northeastern Colorado and interconnections 
        with major interstate pipelines in eastern Nebraska<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN9">(9)</a> 
		increased significantly. The addition of this new capacity has provided an outlet 
		for increased gas production flowing from the several major new gas gathering 
		systems and laterals built within the coalbed methane producing basins of 
        Wyoming in the past several years.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN10">(10)</a> Despite this capacity increase, many 
        market analysts believe that even more interstate pipeline capacity is 
        required to utilize completely the productive capacity of the producing 
        fields in the Rocky Mountain area.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN11">(11)</a><br>

      Growth</b><br>
      <br>
      Of the more than 50 natural gas pipeline projects completed in 2002, most 
      were short-haul in nature. Only 11 projects (Table 2) increased pipeline 
      capacity across regional boundaries (Figure 4). Most of the interregional 
      increase occurred on interstate pipeline systems transporting gas from the 
      Southwest region to other regions: 317 MMcf/d to the Western region, 230 
      MMcf/d to the Northeast (via the Southeast) region, and 115 MMcf/d to Mexico. 
      Additions to interregional capacity in 2002 amounted to only 1,535 MMcf/d 
      overall, the smallest annual level in 10 years. <br>

      <p>The largest amount of interregional transport capacity remains with the 
      13 interstate pipeline systems transporting gas from the Southwest region 
      to the Southeast region, 22,001 MMcf/d, while the second largest is on eight 
      interstate pipeline systems operating between the Central region and the 
      Midwest region, 15,187 MMcf/d (Table 4). The sizable growth in the latter 
      - it was 11,728 MMcf/d in 1998 - reflects the large amount of new pipeline 
      capacity from Canada added over the past several years, as represented by 
      the new Alliance Pipeline and the several expansions of the Northern Border 
      system between Montana and Illinois.</p> <br>
      <br>
      <b>Central Region (Including Rocky Mountains Area) Expansions</b><br>
      <br>
      While a significant amount of gas pipeline capacity has been built in the 
      Central region over the past several years, the expanding production in 
      the Wyoming/Utah coalbed methane and deep-gas fields has outpaced the installation 
      of new interstate takeaway capacity in the region. The 2002 Trailblazer 
      System expansion helped to alleviate the area's capacity constraint situation 
      somewhat. However, capacity constraints in the area will likely continue 
      until the completion of the Kern River Transmission system expansion (900 
      MMcf/d), which is scheduled for May 2003. This project will double the capability 
      of the Kern River Transmission system to transport natural gas from Wyoming 
      to California and Nevada. </font> <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the apparent lack of adequate takeaway interstate capacity has 
      created an oversupply problem relative to available pipeline capacity in 
      the area. As a consequence, natural gas producers without contracts for 
      reserved interstate pipeline capacity, or without access to the very limited 
      interruptible capacity with one or more of the interstate pipelines in the 
      area, have experienced lower prices (well below spot price levels found 
      elsewhere in the United States and Canada) to move their production. The 
      relative abundance of coalbed gas in this region also has contributed to 
      the situation. </font> <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      During 2002, seven of the eight pipeline projects completed in the Central 
      region, representing 1,856 MMcf/d of new pipeline capacity, were in the 
      Rocky Mountain area of the region (Table 2). Two of these, the Colorado 
      Interstate Gas Company's Valley Line and Trailblazer System expansions, 
      increased capacity on the interstate pipeline system, while five others 
      added to the intrastate gas gathering pipeline infrastructure. The largest 
      of these intrastate projects, the Jonah Opal Loop Project, added 400 MMcf/d 
      to the existing pipeline that now connects the expanding Jonah field in 
      southwest Wyoming with the Williams' Companies Opal Gas Processing plant 
      (with access to the Northwest Pipeline and Kern River Transmission systems).</font>

        <br>
      </p>
      Interestingly, pipeline capacity from the North Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle 
      areas into the Central region has increased by 3 percent since 2000 (Figure 
      3). But this new capacity was not directed to the Midwest region as it might 
      have been in the past. A large portion of this new capacity has been directed 
      into the Central region's St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area. Moreover, 
      natural gas from increased coalbed methane development in southeast Colorado 
      is being routed through Texas and Oklahoma to reach this growing market, 
      in addition to serving new gas-fired power plants in the Southwest. <A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN12">(12)</a>
	  </font> <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      As of March 2003, 20 natural gas pipeline projects, representing 2,786 MMcf/d 
      of potential new interstate gas pipeline capacity for Central region shippers, 
      have been proposed or approved for installation between 2003 and 2005. Included 
      among these 20 projects are four new pipeline systems,<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN13">(13)</a> each 
	  of which exceeds 200 miles in length and has a capacity of at least 120 MMcf/d. 
	  They will target markets in the Midwest with gas production coming from the coalbed 
      methane and deep-gas fields located in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Montana. 
      In addition, another four large-scale pipeline projects<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN14">(14)</a> are slated to 
      expand existing capacity by 1,975 MMcf/d between these fields and markets 
      in the Western region.</font> <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      In January 2003, Wyoming Interstate Gas Company announced its intention 
      to build a 60-mile pipeline parallel to its existing system that would be 
      capable of moving between 300 and 600 MMcf/d of coalbed methane gas production 
      from eastern Wyoming to western Wyoming to interconnect with Kern River 
      Transmission and Questar pipelines. Installation of such a line would greatly 
      enhance the flexibility of gas movements in the State and, for the first 
      time, provide Western markets significant access to Powder River Basin supplies.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <br>
      </p>
      <b>Midwest Expansions</b><br>
      <br>
      Interstate natural gas pipeline capacity into and out of the Midwest region 
      has not increased significantly since 2000, when service began on the Alliance 
      Pipeline (1,630 MMcf/d) between British Columbia, Canada, and Joliet, Illinois, 
      and on the Vector Pipeline (720 MMcf/d) between Joliet, Illinois, and Ontario, 
      Canada (Figure 2). <br>
      <br>
      The emphasis in the region in recent years has been to direct additional 
      capacity from the Chicago Hub to expanding markets within the region, particularly 
      northeast Illinois and southern Wisconsin. Two new pipelines, the Horizon 
      Pipeline (380 MMcf/d-29 miles), and the Guardian Pipeline (750 MMcf/d-142 
      miles), were installed in 2002 to serve these areas (Figure 2).<br>
      <br>
      Another section of the Midwest region that experienced recent pipeline expansion, 
      albeit not large, has been in the southwest Illinois area. In 2002, several 
      projects were completed that expanded gas service in the East St Louis, 
      Illinois, and adjacent St Louis, Missouri, area by 320 MMcf/d (Table 2). 
      The steadily growing demand for natural gas in the St. Louis metropolitan 
      area also has attracted several pipeline expansions originating from the 
      west, including transportation of supply from as far as the Rocky Mountain 
      area of Wyoming and Colorado.<br>
      <br>
      In 2002, 2,058 MMcf/d of capacity was added within the Midwest region with 
      the completion of seven gas pipeline projects (Table 2, Figure 1). In addition 
      to the completion of the new Guardian and Horizon in northern Illinois, 
      two new laterals, the MichCon Renaissance Line (110 MMcf/d) in central Michigan 
      and the Texas Eastern Transmission Hanging Rock (289 MMcf/d) line in southeastern 
      Ohio, were installed and now provide local service to several gas-fired 
      electric generation plants. </font> <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      For the short term (2003-2005), only five gas pipeline projects have been 
      proposed for development in the region to date. No new expansions have been 
      proposed within the region east of Chicago, Illinois. The five projects, 
      totaling only 602 MMcf/d of new capacity (Table 1), are located in northern 
      Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and southern Minnesota. All are either expansions 
      to existing laterals or new laterals supplying new gas-fired electric generation 
      facilities. No new pipelines, or major expansions, have been announced so 
      far. The ANR Pipeline Company's West Leg expansion proposal (of its Madison 
      lateral), 220 MMcf/d, is the largest project of the group. The WeEnergy's 
      Guardian lateral (38-mile-65 MMcf/d) is slated to be in service in the spring 
      of 2003 and represents the final service interconnection for the Guardian 
      Pipeline, completed in 2002 (Figure 2).<br>
      <br>
     <b>Northeast Expansions</b><br>
      <br>
      Natural gas pipeline capacity in the Northeast region has increased during 
      the past two years with added capacity focused on serving the Boston and 
      New York City metropolitan areas (Figure 3). Capacity into the New York 
      City area increased by 9 percent between January 2001 and December 2002. 
      While the increase into the Boston area during that time was only 2 percent, 
      several projects are planned for 2003-2004, which would add an additional 
      1,245 MMcf/d to natural gas pipeline service in the area, a further 55-percent 
      increase in capacity. <br>
      <br>
      In 2002, nine gas pipeline expansion projects were completed in the Northeast 
      region (Table 2, Figure 1). Combined, they added 1,500 MMcf/d to gas pipeline 
      capacity in the region. About 60 percent of the increase in capacity in 
      2002 came from the creation of new laterals, or expansion to existing ones 
      (mainly slated to serve new gas-fired electrical generation plant needs). 
      The remainder represented a sizable expansion of mainline transmission capacity 
      (Table 2). <br>
      <br>
      Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company increased its mainline capacity into 
      the region by 230 MMcf/d with the completion of its Sundance Expansion between 
      Louisiana and Virginia, and within the region with the completion of the 
      Leidy East project (126 MMcf/d) and the related last phase of its 289 MMcf/d 
      Market Link project (127 MMcf/d added in 2002). Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company 
      also increased its capability to serve growing peak-day demand in New England 
      and other areas of the Northeast. Its completion of a new 487 MMcf/d lateral 
      from the newly opened Stagecoach underground gas storage field in south 
      central New York, and its related expansion of its northern Pennsylvania 
      mainline, have improved its transportation service between Leidy (Hub) and 
      its East Coast markets. Within New England, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company 
      also added 100 MMcf/d to its Rhode Island mainline to provide service to 
      a new gas-fired power plant located in the State. These two pipeline companies 
      have also announced several proposals that will continue their expansion 
      in the Northeast. Together, the two companies represent 28 percent of the 
      overall proposed Northeast region pipeline capacity increases between 2003 
      and 2005. <br>
      <br>
      Between 2003 and 2005, 24 pipeline expansion projects, representing 5,616 
      MMcf/d of potential new capacity, have been proposed to upgrade and improve 
      gas service in the Northeast region. The proposed increase for 2003 is almost 
      twice as much as the 2002 level, ranking the region second in expected capacity 
      increases in 2003. Potential increases to regional capacity in 2004-05 place 
      it third among regions for capacity growth during that period. In 2003, 
      18 percent of total new regional gas pipeline capacity is slated to come 
      from Canada (see below), while in 2004 that figure jumps to 67 percent. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Overall, almost 42 percent (2,344 MMcf) of the proposed new regional pipeline 
      capacity is slated to improve service to the New York City area, while another 
      32 percent (1,820 MMcf/d) is slated for the Boston metropolitan area. Some 
      of the additional capacity into the New York City area represents new pipeline 
      capacity fed by the planned increase in pipeline capacity that will come 
      south from Canada via expansion routes through New England. Most of the 
      remaining new pipeline capacity could come from several pipeline proposals 
      that include increasing capacity to the Leidy (Pennsylvania) area and to 
      the New York City area.<br>
      <br>
      The New York City area itself is slated to increase its incoming pipeline 
      capacity substantially between 2003 and 2005. Specifically, the long-delayed 
      714 MMcf/d Millennium Pipeline project could be placed in service sometime 
      in late 2004 while several other projects are scheduled to add as much as 
      1,080 MMcf/d in 2003. Combined, possible expansions in 2003-2005 could increase 
      incoming pipeline capacity by more than 53 percent (1,894 MMcf/d) over 2002 
      levels (Table 1). Projects completed over the past several years in the 
      area have helped relieve many of the localized capacity constraint points 
      that developed in the New York City area over the past 5 to 10 years. In 
      addition, some of these recently completed projects are providing needed 
      capacity to support new gas-fired electric power plants that are being built 
      to feed the PJM power grid and the growing metropolitan area industrial 
      base.<br>
      <br>
      With the slated increase in gas pipeline capacity scheduled for installation 
      in the next several years, it is expected that enough new capacity will 
      be available to handle existing and new demand in the area. However, if 
      delays are encountered, or any of these projects are canceled, it is possible 
      that some localized capacity constraint problems could redevelop.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Southeast Expansions</b><br>
      <br>
      In 2002, eight pipeline expansion projects, representing 3,056 MMcf/d of 
      new gas pipeline capacity, were completed in the Southeast region. The largest 
      of these, and the most significant, was the new Gulfstream Pipeline System 
      (Figure 2), which has the capability to deliver up to 1,130 MMcf/d to central 
      Florida from Alabama/Mississippi via the Gulf of Mexico. Gulfstream also 
      completed an interconnection with the Gulf South Pipeline in Alabama to 
      provide regional gas shippers with greater flexibility in shipping gas via 
      its system.<br>
      <br>
      Between 2003 and 2005, 22 proposed pipeline expansion projects, or project 
      phases, could potentially add as much as 8,761 MMcf/d to gas pipeline capacity 
      in the Southeast region. If this level is reached, the Southeast region 
      would lead the nation in new capacity additions during the period. However, 
      a sizable portion of this potential capacity comes from several large competing 
      proposals (where only one might survive) and several other large pipeline 
      projects that still remain in their planning stage. For example, three proposals, 
      each to build 700-800 MMcf/d capacity pipelines between LNG vaporization 
      facilities located in the Bahama Islands and South Florida, are competing 
      for similar markets and are predicated upon the future development of several 
      new gas-fired power plants in the area. <br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the need for new pipeline capacity is strong in the region. 
      At least five storage-related pipeline expansion projects, including a new 
      185 MMcf/d pipeline to provide greater access to the recently reactivated 
      Elba Island LNG import facility, are very likely to be completed as designed. 
      Several high-deliverability (salt cavern) underground gas storage facilities 
      are being built in the region to support the growing variable load needs 
      of such customers as gas-fired power plant operators. Two such facilities, 
      the Richton (2004) and Southern Pines (2003) storage sites in Mississippi, 
      will interconnect with the interstate pipeline system via three separate 
      600 MMcf/d capacity laterals.<br>
      <br>
      The Southern Natural Gas Company and Florida Gas Transmission Company (despite 
      increased competition in its Florida market from Gulfstream Pipeline) continue 
      to schedule expansions to their respective systems in the region. Southern 
      has completed at least one expansion project each year since 1996 and plans 
      three more through 2005. Although most of its expansions, with the exception<br>
      of two planned for 2003, represented less than 100 MMcf/d each in new capacity, 
      demand growth in Southern Natural's service territory has necessitated a 
      steady increase in expansion capacity. Similarly, gas demand growth in Alabama 
      and particularly in Florida has necessitated capacity expansions on Florida 
      Gas Transmission's system each year since 2000, including two more scheduled 
      for 2003 (all greater than 100 MMcf/d in added capacity).<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN15">(15)</a> <br>
      <br>
      <b>Western Expansions</b><br>
      <br>
      In 2002, 2,852 MMcf/d of gas pipeline capacity was added in the Western 
      region with the completion of 12 major projects (Table 2). New pipeline 
      capacity in the Western region accounted for about 22 percent of all gas 
      pipeline capacity additions in the Lower 48 States in 2002, compared with 
      only 2 and 3 percent in 2000 and 2001, respectively (Figure 5). Contributing 
      to this large jump was that four of the five major interstate natural gas 
      pipeline systems in the region underwent capacity expansions of from 5 to 
      10 percent in 2002, while two entirely new interstate natural gas pipeline 
      systems were also placed into service. In addition, the opening of several 
      new gas-fired electric generating plants in the region required the installation 
      of five new lateral (feeder) pipelines and the expansion of several mainline 
      pipeline segments.<br>
      <br>
      <p align="center"> <img align="middle" src="images/figure5.gif" width=673 height=566 alt="Figure 5. Percent of New U.S. Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity Addition by Geographic Region, 2000-2005" border="0"><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      </font>
      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">Completion of the 
        El Paso Natural Gas Company's Line 2000 project, which entailed the conversion 
        of an oil pipeline to replace a major portion of its vintage South System, 
        was not originally slated to include an expansion of capacity. But as 
        gas demand in Arizona and southern California grew during the 2000-2001 
        energy shortfall, the project was modified to include an upgrading of 
        several gas compressor stations along the route, with an increase in capacity 
        of 230 MMcf/d. <br>
        <br>
        Addressing the same demand for increased interstate gas pipeline capacity 
        into California, the Transwestern Pipeline Company also improved its system 
        capacity between New Mexico and California with an increase of 120 MMcf/d. 
        For similar reasons, PG&amp;E Gas Transmission-Northwest increased its 
        system capability by 207 MMcf/d (of Canadian import capacity) into Northern 
        California, while the Northwest Pipeline Company increased its regional 
        capacity by 160 MMcf/d in 2002, and plans to add another 443 MMcf/d in 
        2003.<br>
        <br>
        Within California, the two major intrastate pipeline companies, Southern 
        California Gas (SoCal) and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E), upgraded 
        their respective mainline systems to improve their takeoff capacity from 
        the expanded interstate system. In addition, they upgraded their interconnections 
        with California gas production fields and built several new laterals to 
        supply the new gas-fired power plants that were brought online in the 
        State in 2002. However, as energy demand stabilized in the region, especially 
        within the State, the original intended market for several pipeline projects 
        changed. <br>
        <br>
        For instance, the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline (Figure 2), which was 
        originally planned as a transporter of natural gas to customers within 
        California, has redirected its deliveries to gas-fired power plants within 
        Arizona instead. El Paso Natural Gas Company now also directs a sizable 
        portion of its South System capacity to several new gas-fired power plants 
        near Phoenix, Arizona, and to the North Baja Pipeline (Figure 2). <br>
        <br>
        Reflecting a shift in short-term gas needs in the region, the 21 gas pipeline 
        projects that have been proposed for 2003 through 2005 are now less focused 
        on California and more on the northwest part of the region and the States 
        of Arizona and Nevada. Indeed, only about 30 percent of the proposed capacity 
        would directly impact California, compared with 70 percent in 2002.<br>
        <br>
        Of the 21 proposed 2003-2005 projects, 8 are pipeline expansions or new 
        laterals that would improve gas transportation services (1,463 MMcf/d) 
        in the Northwest part of the region in the States of Washington, Oregon, 
        or Idaho, while another 8 projects (3,956 MMcf/d) would, for the most 
        part, improve service to Nevada and Arizona customers and provide additional 
        service to exporting pipelines such as the North Baja Pipeline. The North 
        Baja Pipeline (500 MMcf/d) runs from an interconnection with El Paso Natural 
        Gas Company at the Arizona/California border south to the California/Mexico 
        border, where it delivers natural gas to its Mexican counterpart for shipment 
        to several gas-fired power plants located in Baja California, Mexico. 
        El Paso Natural Gas Company has a two-phase project planned for 2004 and 
        2005 that would add 330 MMcf/d to its South System to support growing 
        gas demand in Arizona and for the North Baja system.<br>
        <br>
        As gas pipeline capacity (service) demand in the Western region continues 
        to expand, the need for underground storage facilities to support this 
        growth also is being addressed. In California, the proposed expansion 
        of the Wild Goose storage facility in 2004 includes the building of a 
        700 MMcf/d, 25-mile lateral, to an interconnection with Pacific Gas and 
        Electric Company's mainline transmission system. In Arizona, two new storage 
        facilities, targeting shippers to the Arizona/California market, have 
        been proposed that will necessitate the building of 331 miles of pipeline 
        with 1,700 MMcf/d of capacity. Overall, more than 2,690 MMcf/d of proposed 
        new pipeline capacity is related to development of storage infrastructure 
        in the Western region between 2003 and 2005.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Southwest and Gulf of Mexico Developments</b><br>
        <br>
        Only a relatively small amount of new natural gas pipeline capacity (882 
        MMcf/d) was installed in the Southwest region (including the Gulf of Mexico) 
        in 2002. In fact, the region accounted for only 7 percent of the total 
        new gas pipeline capacity installed in the Lower 48 States in 2002. Comparatively, 
        in 2000 and 2001, the percentage was 20 and 23 percent, respectively (Figure 
        5). Moreover, Gulf of Mexico pipeline development (two projects) represented 
        75 percent of new capacity addition in the region in 2002, while onshore 
        regional expansions (four projects) accounted for only 25 percent of new 
        pipeline capacity.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN16">(16)</a> <br>
        <br>
        The only major interstate pipeline in the Southwest region to expand its 
        regional exit capacity in 2002 was the Transcontinental Gas PipeLine Company, 
        with the completion of its 230 MMcf/d Sundance expansion extending from 
        Louisiana to Virginia. Otherwise, there has not been any significant increase 
        in pipeline capacity on the other major interstate pipeline systems, such 
        as Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, 
        Trunkline Gas Company, and ANR Pipeline Company, who provide the Midwest 
        region with access to Gulf Coast production, in a number of years. Indeed, 
        for the past five years, competition from Canadian natural gas imports 
        into the Midwest has eliminated the need for any serious proposals for 
        new pipeline capacity within the transportation corridor between the Southwest/Gulf 
        of Mexico production and the Midwest. <br>
        <br>
        Growing demand for natural gas in the Northeast region and the adjoining 
        Southeast region, especially along the route of the Transcontinental Gas 
        PipeLine system through the Atlantic Coast States, has supported the yearly 
        expansion of the system over the past 10 years - with 430 MMcf/d added 
        since 2000 alone. A major factor in these annual expansions has been that 
        a number of new gas-fired power plants have been built along its route, 
        which it now supplies. But, overall demand in the region has increased 
        in other sectors as well, notably in industrial use, which has also supported 
        these capacity increases. Other pipeline systems in the region have also 
        benefited from this region-wide growth in new gas-fired electric power 
        plant development. For instance, the Southern Natural Gas has added more 
        than 180 MMcf/d (a 7-percent increase) to its regional capacity since 
        2000.<br>
        <br>
        Through 2005, 15 gas pipeline projects, representing 5,560 MMcf/d of additional 
        regional capacity, have been proposed for the region and the offshore 
        Gulf of Mexico. However, only 1,660 MMcf/d, or 30 percent, of that total 
        represents proposed onshore pipeline capacity additions, all in 2003. 
        In fact, to date, no additional onshore interstate pipeline expansion 
        projects have been proposed beyond 2003. Nevertheless, the potential increase 
        in new gas pipeline capacity in the Southwest region rises significantly 
        in 2003 compared with 2002 (Table 1), bolstered by several large-scale 
        offshore projects, although it does drop off again in 2004-2005. </font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><b>Growth in Import/Export 
        Pipeline Capacity</b><br>
        <br>
        The removal of gas tariffs between the United States and Canada in 1996 
        and between the United States and Mexico in 1998, under the North American 
        Free Tree Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994, helped bring about major growth in 
        new pipeline capacity from Canada to the United States and from the United 
        States to Mexico (Figures 6 and 7). In the latter case, new industrial 
        gas users initially were the underpinning for installation of the new 
        capacity, but in recent years new gas-fired power plant development along 
        the northern border area of Mexico has also supported the expansion. From 
        1990 to 2002, U.S. natural gas pipeline import capacity grew by 128 percent 
        while U.S. export capacity grew by more than 300 percent (Table 4). <br>
        <br>
        Besides the impact of NAFTA, relaxation of gas regulations and the creation 
        of the Comision Reguladora de Energia (CRE) in Mexico since 1995 have 
        stimulated the expanded development of local gas distribution companies 
        in the country and their relationship with U.S. pipeline exporters and 
        marketers.<br>
        <br>
        During 2002, 624 MMcf/d in additional export capacity to Mexico was installed 
        at a cost of more than $148 million, which does not include the cost of 
        related facilities installed in Mexico itself (Table 2). Another 729 MMcf/d 
        has been approved by FERC for installation in 2003 (Figure 6) although, 
        to date, no further expansion projects have been announced, or applied 
        for, that would increase pipeline export capacity in 2004 or beyond.<br>
        <br>
        The large expansion of import pipeline capacity from Canada has been supported 
        by two simultaneous, complementary situations, which were further supported 
        by incentives contained in NAFTA. First, growing demand for natural gas 
        in the U.S. Western, Midwest, and Northeast regions outstripped the capability 
        of U.S. production in the Southwest to meet new demand levels. This situation 
        stimulated exploration and development by Canadian energy producers who 
        believed that they could respond to the U.S natural gas shortfall successfully, 
        especially under NAFTA.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">Initially, during 
        the mid-1990s, available gas productive capacity in existing Canadian 
        gas production areas was directed toward expansions of existing U.S. natural 
        gas pipeline systems such as PG&amp;E Transmission-Northwest Company (formerly, 
        Pacific Gas Transmission Company), Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited, 
        and Viking Gas Transmission Company. Several new importing pipelines, 
        such as the Iroquois Gas Transmission system and the Empire Pipeline, 
        were also built to reach growing U.S. markets. Subsequently, as the surplus 
        existing production sources were tapped for export, new Canadian natural 
        gas reserves were discovered and their production directed mostly to markets 
        in the United States. This new Canadian productive capacity was found 
        primarily in two areas, in northeast British Columbia and offshore eastern 
        Canada. <br>
        <br>
        The Alliance Pipeline was built in 2000 to tap the major natural gas discoveries 
        within northern British Columbia, Canada, in areas such as the Ladyfern 
        field. Even with NAFTA, however, to be economically successful, the Alliance 
        system was designed to be able to transport &quot;wet&quot; natural gas 
        to Midwest markets, where the liquids could be extracted locally (at the 
        Aux Sable gas processing plant in Joliet, Illinois) and sold in the more 
        profitable U.S. market (Figure 2). To date, the Alliance system has been 
        operating at close to capacity. The new supplies of northeastern British 
        Columbia have also helped supplement gas supplies directed to markets 
        in the Western region as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2">The Sable Island 
        natural gas discoveries of the mid-1990s on the Scotian Shelf, offshore 
        eastern Canada, led to the development of the 440 MMcf/d Maritimes and 
        Northeast Pipeline system between Nova Scotia and Massachusetts in 1999. 
        This system now serves markets in Maine, New Hampshire, and northern Massachusetts. 
        In 2003, its reach will extend to the Boston metropolitan area with the 
        completion of a 350 MMcf/d extension. A doubling of its capacity has been 
        proposed (filed with FERC) for 2004. <br>
        <br>
        And, despite the recent U.S. economic slowdown and the relatively mild 
        weather conditions of the past several years, gas import volumes from 
        Canada continue to increase. While monthly gas import levels did drop 
        briefly during the 2001-2002 heating season (November through March), 
        most likely because of mild temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast, 
        import volumes resumed their steady month-to-month growth pattern during 
        the latter part of 2002. Preliminary data indicate that in 2002 gas imports 
        from Canada increased about 2.7 percent over 2001 levels.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN17">(17)</a> <br>
        <br>
        Nevertheless, there are also some signs that development of new import 
        capacity from Canada may be reaching a temporary zenith into several key 
        U.S. markets. For instance, little or no additional import capacity has 
        been built into the Midwest since 2000 and none has been proposed - at 
        least through 2004. A similar situation exists in the Western region. 
        While the PG&amp;E Gas Transmission-Northwest completed a 207 MMcf/d expansion 
        in 2002, it canceled a planned 163 MMcf/d 2003 expansion owing to the 
        loss of the supporting customer, a gas-fired electric power plant that 
        was to have been located in Oregon. The only other scheduled additional 
        import capacity into the region is also based on supplying another gas-fired 
        electric power plant. It should be noted, however, that the Sumas Energy 
        2 power plant, now scheduled for completion in 2004, and which would require 
        up to 140 MMcf/d of pipeline capacity, had been postponed previously and 
        could be again.<br>
        <br>
        Currently, the only U.S. region that has any new natural gas pipeline 
        import capacity from Canada proposed for 2003 (495 MMcf/d) is the Northeast 
        (Figure 7). Moreover, beyond 2003, much of the proposed capacity into 
        the region is supply, rather than demand, driven. The Maritimes &amp; 
        Northeast's 2004 expansion proposal is predicated largely upon the new 
        production that is scheduled to be coming from the Scotian Shelf in eastern 
        offshore Canada by then.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN18">(18)</a> Currently, this pipeline expansion proposal 
        also is geared toward supplying potential gas-fired power plants that 
        are planned for the corridor between Nova Scotia and Massachusetts over 
        the next five years. Yet, several of the other proposals to expand capacity 
        to import Canadian gas into the Northeast are also predicated upon the 
        same potential customer source. <br>

        the sponsors of the various active proposals will either have to scale 
        back capacity expansion levels, cancel their project completely, or compete

        beyond the current boundaries.</font> <font face="verdana, ms sans serif, arial" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        <b>Outlook</b><br>
        <br>
        As of March 2003, 112 natural gas pipeline expansion projects, in various 
        stages of development, have been proposed for the Lower 48 States for 
        2003 through 2005. For 2003, 61 projects are planned; for 2004, 36; for 
        2005, only 15 to date.<br>
        <br>
        Of the 61 projects planned for 2003, however, only 42 have been approved 
        by regulatory authorities, as of March 2003. These approved projects represent 
        a combined capacity level of 9,845 MMcf/d, or a little more than three-fourths 
        of the total capacity additions proposed for 2003. While 13 additional 
        projects have been filed with regulators and are awaiting a disposition, 
        6 projects (1,323 MMcf/d) have yet to be filed and remain in the planning 
        stage. Some of these latter projects, which could be completed relatively 
        quickly once approval is granted, have a chance of being completed in 
        2003. However, it is more likely that a substantial portion of the 1,323 
        MMcf/d represented by these 6 projects will not be installed in 2003, 
        being either canceled, placed on indefinite hold or, more likely, postponed 
        until 2004.<br>
        <br>
        However, if 2003 is typical, some unannounced, quick turn-around projects 
        that do not fall under FERC's jurisdiction will be completed during the 
        year, compensating for some of the proposed capacity additions that will 
        be deferred or dropped. The effect of this process in the past has been 
        that about half of the potential loss of proposed capacity from cancellations 
        and other reasons is made up during the year by completion of such projects. 
        Thus, the original estimate of 12,937 MMcf/d (Table 1) of new capacity 
        for 2003 could be eventually adjusted to about 12,000 MMcf/d. <br>
        <br>
        Because of the current downturn of the national economy, it is also possible 
        that the final figure for 2003 could fall to around 11,000 MMcf/d, as 
        some approved projects are likely to be downsized or postponed as markets 
        adjust to changes in local economies and/or some proposed gas-fired electric 
        power plants are themselves postponed or canceled.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN19">(19)</a> <br>
        <br>
        For 2004-2005, as of March 2003, only 14 of the 51 proposed projects have 
        been approved, and 13 more have been filed with regulatory authorities 
        for review. The remaining 37 projects are still in the concept or planning 
        stage.<A HREF="pipenet03.html#FN20">(20)</a> Indeed, project specifications for more than 8,800 MMcf/d of 
        the 18,939 MMcf/d capacity additions proposed to date have yet to be finalized. 
        At this stage it is impossible to predict what portion of the current 
        19 Bcf/d estimate will eventually be developed, especially since many 
        new pipelines or expansion projects are not filed until 18 months in advance 
        of their proposed in-service date. <br>
        <br>
        Between 1991 and 2001, more than 60 Bcf/d of capacity (through pipeline 
        expansions and building of new pipelines) was incorporated into the Lower 
        48 interstate gas transmission network, an average of 6 Bcf/d per year. 
        With the exception of the years (1994-1996) when the gas pipeline industry 
        adopted a wait-and-see approach to expansion following the interstate 
        pipeline restructuring mandated by FERC Order 636 in 1992, annual additions 
        to interstate natural gas pipeline transmission capacity exceeded 5 Bcf/d 
        in the 1990s. In 2001 capacity additions approached the 10 Bcf/d level. 
        In 2002 they reached 12.8 Bcf/d (Table 1).<br>
        <br>
        With the current economic slowdown in the United States, however, it is 
        unlikely that this pace will be maintained in the short term. Despite 
        the fact that a 12.9 Bcf/d increase in gas pipeline capacity has been 
        proposed for 2003 and another 18.9 Bcf/d for 2004-2005, it is likely that 
        only about 70 to 80 percent of the proposed capacity additions will eventually 
        be completed.</font></p>

      <p><A NAME="FN18">18. </A> On February 27, 2003, EnCana Corp. notified the Canadian National 
        Energy Board (NEB) that it was delaying plans to develop its proposed 
        400 MMcf/d Deep Panuke project located under the Scotian Shelf. This action 
        could temporarily limit the availability of gas supplies to any potential 
        Maritimes &amp; Northeast pipeline expansion.<br>
      </p>
      <p><A NAME="FN19">19. </A> In fact, on February 5, 2003, Transcontinental Gas PipeLine Company 
        announced that it had requested permission from FERC to downsize its Momentum 
        expansion project from 359,000 Dth/d to 323,000 Dth/d because of changes 
        in the needs of several electric generation customers in the Southeast. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><A NAME="FN20">20. </A> It should also be kept in mind that estimated costs are nonexistent 
        or unannounced for a number of pipeline expansion proposals that have 
        yet to be filed with regulatory authorities. Consequently, the cost totals 
        provided for 2003 and beyond in Table 1 should be considered low. <br>
