 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (a) Unaccounted for crude oil represents the difference between the supply and
disposition of crude oil. Refinery processing gain represents the volumetric
amount by which total output is greater than input for a given period of time.
Preliminary estimates of crude oil imports at the National level have 
historically understated final values by approximately 50 thousand barrels per 
day. This causes the preliminary values of unaccounted for crude oil to 
overstate the final values by the same amount.

 (b) Includes fuel ethanol blended into finished motor gasoline.
 (c) Includes products in the pentanes plus category only. 
 (d) Includes pentanes plus, other liquids, and all finished petroleum products
except finished motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, residual fuel oil, jet 
fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases.
 (e) Crude oil stocks in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve include non-U.S.
 stocks held under foreign or commercial storage agreements.
 (f) Excludes distillate stocks located in the "Northeast Heating Oil Reserve".


 (s) = Less than 500 barrels per day. 
 E=Estimate. 
 Note: Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding.
