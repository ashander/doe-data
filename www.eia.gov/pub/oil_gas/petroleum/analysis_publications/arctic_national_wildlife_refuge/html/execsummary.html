    </b><font SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Service Report, <i>Potential Oil Production
    from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Updated Assessment,</i> was
    prepared for the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources at the request of
    Chairman Frank H. Murkowski in a letter dated March 10, 2000. The request asked the Energy
    Information Administration (EIA) to develop plausible scenarios for Arctic National
    Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) supply development consistent with the most recent U.S. Geological
    Survey (USGS) resource assessments. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report contains EIA projections of future daily production rates
    using recent USGS resource estimates. The Coastal Plain study area includes 1.5 million
    acres in the ANWR 1002 Area, 92,000 acres of Native Inupiat lands and State of Alaska
    offshore lands out to the 3-mile limit which are expected to be explored and developed if
    and when ANWR is developed. </font><a href="http://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/analysis_publications/arctic_national_wildlife_refuge/html/figurees1.html"><font face="Times New Roman"
    size="3">(Figure ES1)</font></a><font SIZE="3"> About 26 percent of the technically
    recoverable oil resources are in the Native and State lands. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Coastal Plain region, which comprises approximately 8 percent of
    the 19 million-acre ANWR, is along the geologic trend that is productive in the Prudhoe
    Bay area, 60 miles west. This is the largest unexplored, potentially productive onshore
    basin in the United States. The 1002 area is now closed to exploration and development,
    although Native and State lands are open. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The USGS made the following estimates in 1998 of technically
    recoverable oil and natural gas liquids from the ANWR Coastal Plain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a 95 percent probability (a 19 in 20 chance) that at least 5.7 billion barrels
        of oil are recoverable. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a 5 percent probability (a 1 in 20 chance) that at least 16 billion barrels of
        oil are recoverable. </li>
      <li>The mean (expected value) estimate is 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By comparison, total 1998 U.S. proved reserves of crude oil were
    estimated to be 21 billion barrels and the 1993 estimate of undiscovered technically
    recoverable oil for the onshore lower 48 States (that would come from tens of thousands of
    small fields) was about 23 billion barrels. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EIA postulated yearly development rates of the resources without
    specifying the effect of various levels of oil prices and technology advances, and then
    projected daily production rates based on the USGS estimates, as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low and high ANWR yearly development rates ranging from 250 to 800 million barrels per
        year are postulated for each of the three USGS estimates, forming 6 cases.</li>
      <li>Projected ANWR peak production rates range from 650,000 to 1.9 million barrels per day
        across the 6 cases.</li>
      <li>For the mean resource case (10.3 billion barrels technically recoverable), ANWR peak
        production rates range from 1.0 to 1.35 million barrels per day.</li>
      <li>Even with nearby production infrastructure, 7 to 12 years would be needed for lease
        sales, permitting and environmental reviews after approval for leasing. It is projected
        that initial ANWR production could occur around 2010 if leasing approval occurred within
        the next few years.</li>
      <li>The imported refiner acquisition cost in 2020 is projected in EIA&#146;s <i>Annual
        Energy Outlook 2000</i> reference case at $22.04 (1998 dollars). At this price, the
        potential ANWR oil recovered would have a value between $125 and $350 billion (in 1998
        dollars.)</font></li>
