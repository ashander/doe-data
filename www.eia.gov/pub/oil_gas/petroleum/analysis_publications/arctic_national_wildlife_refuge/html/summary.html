    <b><p align="center"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5">3.&nbsp; Summary</p>
    </font></b><font SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the 19
    million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the largest unexplored, potentially
    productive geologic onshore basin in the United States. The primary area of the coastal
    plain is the 1002 Area of ANWR established when ANWR was created. A decision on permitting
    the exploration and development of the 1002 Area is up to Congress and has not been
    approved to date. Also included in the Coastal Plain are State lands to the 3-mile
    offshore limit and Native Inupiat land near the village of Kaktovik.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The USGS estimated:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a 95 percent probability that at least 5.7 billion barrels of technically recoverable
        undiscovered oil are in the ANWR coastal plain, </li>
      <li>a 5 percent probability that at least 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable
        undiscovered oil are in the ANWR coastal plain, and</li>
      <li>a mean or expected value of 10.3 billion barrels of technically recoverable undiscovered
        oil in the ANWR coastal plain. </li>
    </ul>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EIA postulates two development rates for each of the three USPS
    probability estimates without specifying the effect of various levels of oil prices and
    technology advancements, ranging from 250 to 800 million barrels developed per year. EIA
    projects peak production rates from 600,000 to 1.9 million barrels per day over the six
    cases, with peak production estimated to occur 20 - 30 years after the onset of
    production.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seven to 12 years are estimated to be required from an approval to
    explore and develop to first production from the ANWR Area. This study uses 9 years, to
    2010. The time to first production could vary significantly based on time required for
    leasing after approval to develop is given. Environmental considerations and the
    possibility of drilling restrictions would directly impact the time interval to reach
    first production.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The USGS economic analysis of the ANWR 1002 Area calculates that once
    oil has been discovered, more than 80 percent of the technically recoverable oil is
    commercially developable at an oil price of $25 per barrel. The imported refiner
    acquisition cost in 2020 is projected in EIA&#146;s <i>Annual Energy Outlook 2000</i>
    reference case at $22.04 (1998 dollars). At this price, the potential ANWR oil recovered
    would have a value between $125 and $350 billion (in 1998 dollars.)</font></td>
