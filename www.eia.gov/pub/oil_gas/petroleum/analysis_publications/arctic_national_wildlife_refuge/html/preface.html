    <font SIZE="3"><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Potential Oil Production from the Coastal Plain of
    the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Updated Assessment</i> is a product of the Energy
    Information Administration&#146;s (EIA) Reserves and Production Division. EIA, under
    various programs, has assessed foreign and domestic oil and gas resources, reserves, and
    production potential. As a policy-neutral agency, EIA&#146;s standard analysis of the
    potential of the Alaska North Slope (ANS) has focused on the areas without exploration and
    development restrictions.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EIA received a letter (dated March 10, 2000) from Senator Frank H.
    Murkowski as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources requesting
    an EIA Service Report &quot;with plausible scenarios for ANWR supply development
    consistent with the most recent U.S. Geological Survey resource assessments.&quot; This
    service report is prepared in response to the request of Senator Murkowski. It focuses on
    the ANWR coastal plain, a region currently restricted from exploration and development,
    and updates EIA&#146;s 1987 ANWR assessment.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognizing the value of this study, readers should be aware of the
    limitations of the projections. There are many underlying forces of energy markets that
    cannot be known with certainty, such as the speed of technological development, the impact
    of variations in oil prices, changes in legislation, and impacts of the economy on supply
    and demand. The USGS resource estimates, on which the production estimates are based, have
    a sizeable range of uncertainty around them, of which readers should be aware. To allow
    timely completion of this study, simplifying assumptions were made which add to the
    uncertainty of the projections. For example, production schedules were postulated without
    specifying the effect of various levels of oil prices and technology advancements. Rapid
    technology growth can yield lower costs and faster development, with the reverse effect
    given slower technology growth. Oil price is a key factor in determining when production
    becomes economic. </p>
