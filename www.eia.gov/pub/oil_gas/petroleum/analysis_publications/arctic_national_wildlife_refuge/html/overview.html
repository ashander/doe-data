      </b><font SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) 1002 Area
      of the Alaska North Slope represents an area of 1.5 million acres. The ANWR Coastal Plain
      Area includes the 1002 Area, State of Alaska lands to the 3-mile limit from the coast
      line, and approximately 92,000 acres of Native Inupiat lands. The area is located between
      the Prudhoe Bay area of the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and the Mackenzie River Delta of
      Canada along the Beaufort Sea. The area contains the largest onshore, unexplored,
      potentially productive geologic basins in the United States. The 1002 Area is
      approximately 8 percent of the 19 million-acre ANWR.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original Arctic National Wildlife Range of 8.9 million acres was
      created in 1960 by Public Law Order 2214. In 1980 the Alaska National Interest Lands
      Conservation Act (ANILCA) created 16 National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. ANWR was
      enlarged to 19 million acres including the 8.9 million-acre wilderness area. Section 1002
      of ANILCA deferred a decision on the management of oil and gas exploration and development
      of 1.5 million acres of potentially productive lands in the coastal plain of ANWR (which
      is why it is called the &quot;1002 Area.&quot;) Potential for oil and gas discovery is
      great because the area is an extension of the productive trends west of the area toward
      Prudhoe Bay and east toward the Canadian discoveries of the Mackenzie Delta. Congressional
      action would be required to open the land for exploration and development. In 1987 the
      Department of Interior recommended opening the area for oil and gas exploration and
      development. In 1995 the House and Senate approved ANWR 1002 Area development in the
      Budget Act that was vetoed by the President. Interest in the area has increased recently
      with the increase in crude oil prices, declining domestic production, and increasing
      imports.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) updated in 1998 a petroleum
      assessment of the ANWR 1002 Area and the State and Native lands of the coastal plain.
      Based on the new information from the USGS and increased interest in the potential for
      production from the area, this analysis is presented to show the range of potential
      production that can be expected from the development of the ANWR Coastal Plain.</p>
      </font><b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="geographic setting"><font face="Arial" size="3">Geographic
      Setting</font></a></p>
      </b><font SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1002 Area of ANWR covers an area of 1.5 million
      acres between the Canning and Staines Rivers on the west, the Aichilik River to the east,
      the Beaufort Sea to the north, and the Brooks Range to the south. The Canning River
      western boundary is approximately 60 miles east of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)
      and Prudhoe Bay. The 1002 Area extends approximately 100 miles from the Canning and
      Staines rivers (west boundary) to the Aichilik River east boundary. The area extends
      inland from the coast line of the Beaufort Sea from 16 to 34 miles to the foothills of the
      Brooks Range.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alaska native Inupiat have approximately 92,000 acres around the
      village of Kaktovik. These lands along with the State offshore lands to the 3-mile state
      boundary are included in this analysis. The study assumes that the resources of these
      lands also will be developed if and when the Federal lands of the 1002 Area are opened for
      development.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The map of <a href="figure1.html">Figure 1</a> shows the location of
      the 19 million-acre ANWR along the eastern boundary of the state with Canada. The
      locations of the 8.9 million-acre Wilderness Area and the 1.5 million-acre 1002 Area are
      shown in ANWR. The 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve&#150;Alaska (NPR-A) is shown
      to the west of ANWR. Parts of the northeast area of NPR-A were recently opened for
      exploration and development. Between ANWR and NPR-A are the areas that are currently
      producing, including Prudhoe Bay. The path of the northern portion of the Trans-Alaska
      Pipeline (TAPS) is shown as it heads toward Valdez in southern Alaska. Also on the map are
      the Mackenzie River delta in Canada and the trend of the Brooks Range across northern
      Alaska.</p>

      extrapolation of known geology and information from wells drilled offsetting the area
      provide additional confidence that potential oil and gas resources are located in the ANWR
      1002 Area and the Coastal Plain. The stratigraphic section of </font><a

      reservoir rocks of the area. The reservoirs that are productive in other areas of the ANS
      are indicated. The 10 plays (similar geologic settings) that were evaluated by the USGS
      are also included in the figure.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following discussion of the sedimentary rocks in the area is from
      the <i>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, Coastal Plain Reservoir Assessment</i>,
      U.S. Department of the Interior, November 1986, p. 51.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The area in and adjacent to the 1002 area is underlain by
      sedimentary rocks several tens of thousands of feet thick. These rocks range in age from
      Precambrian (greater than 570 million years old) to Quarternary (Bader and Bird, 1986). In
      northern Alaska, rocks prospective for petroleum (oil and gas) are mostly Mississippian to
      Tertiary in age and overlie folded and truncated pre-Mississippian rocks. These rocks are
      divided into two sequences: the Ellesmerian sequence of Mississippian to Early Cretaceous
      age, and the Brookian sequence of Early Cretaceous and younger age. Deposition of the
      Ellesmerian sequence occurred when the land area was to the north and the seaway was to
      the south. During deposition of the Brookian sequence, the geography was reversed&#151;the
      land area was to the south (the ancestral Brooks Range) and the seaway was to the north,
      much as it is today. The differentiation of these two sequences is important in
      understanding depositional history, and in projecting trends of reservoir rocks.
      Futhermore, properties of the Ellesmerian sandstones are generally better than those of
      the Brookian sequence.&quot;</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unique combination of source rocks and reservoir traps is similar
      to the geologic combination of events that caused the productive reservoirs to the west
      including the Prudhoe Bay Field. Therefore, similar results are anticipated.</p>
