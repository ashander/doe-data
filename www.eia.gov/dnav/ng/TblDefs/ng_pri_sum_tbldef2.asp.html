       EIA reduced the reported volume of gas imported by pipeline from Canada by the amount of natural gas liquids removed from the saturated natural gas        carried by Alliance Pipeline.  Alliance moves saturated natural gas from the border to a processing plant in Illinois.  After the adjustment, volumes of        imported natural gas on this pipeline are on the same physical basis as other reported volumes of pipeline imports.

    Average Wellhead Value, Annual Data: Form EIA-895A, "Annual Quantity and Value of Natural Gas Report,"

	value and the quantity of marketed production associated with this value.  A number of states 
	reported volumes of production and associated values for other than marketed production.  
	In addition, information for several states which were unable to provide data was obtained 
	from Form EIA-176.  It should be noted that Form EIA-176 
	reports a fraction of state production.  The imputed value of marketed production in each

    Average Wellhead Value, Preliminary Monthly Data: Preliminary values for the monthly U.S. natural gas wellhead price are estimated from the

	Henry Hub, LA; Carthage, TX; Katy, TX; Waha, TX; and Blanco, NM.  The NYMEX price is 
	reported in the trade publication, Gas Daily (published by Financial Times Energy).  
	The spot prices are published in another trade publication, 
	Natural Gas Week (Energy Intelligence Group), and they reflect the spot 
	delivered-to-pipeline, volume-weighted average prices for natural gas bought and sold at 
	the specified trading hubs. Prices include processing, gathering, and transportation fees 
	to the hubs. The estimated wellhead prices are derived with a statistical procedure based 
	on analysis of monthly time series data for the period 1995 through the present. A 
	statistical procedure was adopted beginning with publication of the February 1999 issue 
	of the Natural Gas Monthly. The preliminary estimates are replaced when annual survey

    Average Price of Deliveries to Consumers: Price data are representative of prices for gas sold and delivered to residential, 
	commercial, and industrial consumers.  These prices do not reflect average prices of 
	natural gas transported to consumers for the account of third parties or "spot-market" 
	prices.	
	Coverage for prices varies by consumer sector.  All average prices , except 
	electric power, are computed by dividing the reported revenue by its associated 
	sales volume.  Preliminary monthly prices for deliveries of natural gas to 
	residential commercial and industrial consumers are calculated from reports to 
	Form EIA-857, "Monthly Report of Natural Gas Purchases and Deliveries to Consumers." 
	Final monthly data are calculated by allocating annual consumption data from the 
	Form EIA-176, to each month in proportion to monthly volumes reported in Form EIA-857.
	In the States of Georgia, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, the 
	residential and commercial sector prices, are collected on the Form EIA-910, 
	"Monthly Natural Gas Marketer Survey," and include data on prices of gas sold to 
	customers in those sectors by energy marketers.  In the District of Columbia, 
	Florida and Michigan, the commercial sector prices are also collected on the 
	Form EIA-910.  Additional states (Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and West 
	Virginia) may be added in the future as data quality becomes acceptable.  
	In these States, prices in the residential and/or commercial sectors are calculated 
	by combining the data from the Form EIA-910 with the EIA-857 (for preliminary 
	monthly prices) and with the Form EIA-176 for final monthly prices. Beginning in January 2005, 
	the EIA-910 added the States of Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts (which was dropped from the 
	survey in 2008), Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. 
	In 2011, the EIA-910 reduced the number of States for which it is used to collect data to 
	Georgia, New York and Ohio only.
