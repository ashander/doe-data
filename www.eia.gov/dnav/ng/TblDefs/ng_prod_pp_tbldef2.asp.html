     Annual data on nonhydrocarbon gases removed from marketed production–carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen sulfide, and nitrogen– were reported by state agencies on the voluntary Form EIA-895A through 2010 and were obtained directly from the states or estimated by EIA for 2011-forward.

    Extraction loss is the reduction in the volume of natural gas available for disposition resulting from the removal of natural gas liquid constituents at natural gas processing plants. It represents that portion of the "raw" gas stream that is transferred from the natural gas supply chain to the petroleum and natural gas liquids supply chain. Extraction loss does not include the reduction in volume resulting from the removal of nonhydrocarbon constituents or gas used as fuel, vented, flared, or otherwise disposed of within natural gas processing plants. Extraction loss also results in a reduction in the total heat (Btu) content of the natural gas stream equal to the heat content of the liquids extracted.

    The Form EIA-64A, "Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production," collects data on the volume of natural gas received for processing, the total quantity of natural gas liquids produced, and the resulting shrinkage (defined as extraction loss in this report) from all natural gas processing- and cycling-plant operators. The quantity of natural gas received and liquids produced are reported by state of origin of the natural gas. Shrinkage volumes are calculated and reported by plant operators based upon the chemical composition of the liquids extracted using standard conversion factors specified in the form instructions

        The Form EIA-816 captures information on the quantity of individual components (i.e., ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane, and pentanes plus) produced or contained in mixes of plant liquids as determined by chemical analysis. The volumetric ratios of the individual components to the total liquids, as calculated from the 12 monthly Form EIA-816 reports for each state, were applied to the annual total liquids production, as reported on the Form EIA-64A, to estimate the quantities of individual components removed at gas-processing plants.
