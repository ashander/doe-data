or conclusive formation test (drill stem or wire line), or if economic producibility is
supported by core analyses and/or electric or other log interpretations.<br><br>

immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which can be reasonably judged as
economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data. In the
absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of 
hydrocarbons is considered to be the lower proved limit of the reservoir.<br><br>

reserves.<br><br>

For natural gas, wet after lease seperation, an appropriate reduction in the reservoir gas
volume has been made to cover the removal of the liquefiable portions of the gas in lease and/or

       There are three principal types of underground storage facilities in operation in the 
	   United States today: salt caverns (caverns hollowed out in salt "bed" or "dome" formations), 
	   depleted fields (depleted reservoirs in oil and/or gas fields), and aquifer reservoirs 
	   (water-only reservoirs conditioned to hold natural gas). A storage facility's daily 
	   deliverability or withdrawal capability is the amount of gas that can be withdrawn from 
	   it in a 24-hour period.  Salt cavern storage facilities generally have high deliverability 
	   because all of the working gas in a given facility can be withdrawn in a relatively short 
	   period of time.  (A typical salt cavern cycle is 10 days to deplete working gas, and 20 
	   days to refill working gas.)  By contrast, depleted field and aquifer reservoirs are 
	   designed and operated to withdraw all working gas over the course of an entire heating 
	   season (about 150 days).  Further, while both traditional and salt cavern facilities can 
	   be switched from withdrawal to injection operations during the heating season, this is 
	   usually more quickly and easily done in salt cavern facilities, reflecting their greater 
	   operational flexibility.

	residential and commercial sector prices, are collected on the Form EIA-910, 
	"Monthly Natural Gas Marketer Survey," and include data on prices of gas sold to

	Virginia) may be added in the future as data quality becomes acceptable.  
	In these States, prices in the residential and/or commercial sectors are calculated

	monthly prices) and with the Form EIA-176 for final monthly prices. Beginning in January 2005, 
	the EIA-910 added the States of Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts (which was dropped from the
