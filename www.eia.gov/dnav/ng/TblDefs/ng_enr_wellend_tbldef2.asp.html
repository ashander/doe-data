  These well counts include only the original drilling of a hole intended to 
  discover or further develop already discovered crude oil or natural gas resources.
  Other drilling activities, such as drilling an old well deeper, drilling of 
  laterals from the original well, drilling of service and injection wells, and
  drilling for resources other than crude oil or natural gas are excluded. Due to
  the methodology used to estimate ultimate well counts from the available partially
  reported data, the counts shown on this page are frequently revised.

  For 1949-1959, data represent wells completed in a given year. For 1960-1969,
  data are for well completion received by the American Petroleum Institute during
  the reporting year. For 1970 forward, the data represent wells completed in a
  given year.  The as-received well completion data for recent years are incomplete
  due delays in the reporting of wells drilled. The Energy Information Administration
  (EIA) therefore statistically imputes the missing data to provide estimates of total
  well completions and footage where necessary.
