Volumes of dry gas withdrawn from gas storage reservoirs are not considered part of production. Dry natural gas production equals marketed production less extraction loss.

       There are three principal types of underground storage facilities in operation in the 
	   United States today: salt caverns (caverns hollowed out in salt "bed" or "dome" formations), 
	   depleted fields (depleted reservoirs in oil and/or gas fields), and aquifer reservoirs 
	   (water-only reservoirs conditioned to hold natural gas). A storage facility's daily 
	   deliverability or withdrawal capability is the amount of gas that can be withdrawn from 
	   it in a 24-hour period.  Salt cavern storage facilities generally have high deliverability 
	   because all of the working gas in a given facility can be withdrawn in a relatively short 
	   period of time.  (A typical salt cavern cycle is 10 days to deplete working gas, and 20 
	   days to refill working gas.)  By contrast, depleted field and aquifer reservoirs are 
	   designed and operated to withdraw all working gas over the course of an entire heating 
	   season (about 150 days).  Further, while both traditional and salt cavern facilities can 
	   be switched from withdrawal to injection operations during the heating season, this is 
	   usually more quickly and easily done in salt cavern facilities, reflecting their greater 
	   operational flexibility.

       EIA reduced the reported volume of gas imported by pipeline from Canada by the amount of natural gas liquids removed from the saturated natural gas        carried by Alliance Pipeline.

      Prices for LNG imports are reported as “landed,” received at the
