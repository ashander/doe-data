natural gas pipeline, or producer, but it operates independently of other segments of the company.

Prices represent the annual-average retail price for volumes delivered to residential and 
commercial customers by marketers who report on EIA-910, "Monthly Natural Gas Marketer Survey" and local 
distribution companies who report on EIA-176, "Annual Report of Natural and Supplemental Gas Supply and Disposition". 
Both sets of prices include the cost of the gas commodity/supply and all transportation and delivery charges. 
Since the prices reflect each State’s aggregate of multiple local distribution companies and marketers, a 
comparison of the aggregate prices may not represent the realized price savings that an individual customer 
might have obtained. Localized tariff rates, distinct contract/pricing options, and contract timing may affect 
the price differential between marketers and licensed distribution companies. Additionally, the 2005 hurricane 
season may have affected future contract offerings beginning in 2006 as prices rose sharply during that period.
