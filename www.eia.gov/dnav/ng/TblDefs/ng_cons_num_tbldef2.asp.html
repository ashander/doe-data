   <strong>Cautionary note:</strong> EIA expects that there may be some double counting in the number of residential and
   commercial customers reported beginning in 1999.

   EIA collects information on the number of residential and commercial consumers through a
   survey of companies that deliver gas to consumers Form EIA-176, "Annual Report of Natural and Supplemental Gas Supply and Disposition"
.
   The survey asks companies for the number of residential and commercial customers served as
   sales customers as well as customers to whom they deliver gas purchased from others.
   Traditionally, residential and commercial customers obtained gas and all services associated
   with delivering it from their local distribution company (LDC). The LDC records these
   customers as sales customers. Customer choice programs allow consumers to select the provider
   from whom they purchase gas. When customers elect to purchase gas from a provider other than
   the LDC, the LDC continues to deliver the gas to the customer even though it no longer sells
   the gas. When customers switch to another provider, they become transportation service
   customers for the LDC. A residential or commercial customer who enters a customer choice
   program may be classified both as a traditional sales customer and, after entering the
   program, as a transportation service customer. This double reporting affects the number of
   residential and commerical consumers measured.

   Customer choice programs, also known as retail unbundling programs, have been ongoing
   since 1998.
