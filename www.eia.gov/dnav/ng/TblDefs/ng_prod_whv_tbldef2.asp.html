    Average Wellhead Value, Annual Data: Form EIA-895A, "Annual Quantity and Value of Natural Gas Report," 
	requests state agencies to report the quantity and value of marketed production.  When 
	complete data are unavailable, the form instructs the state agency to report the available 
	value and the quantity of marketed production associated with this value.  A number of states 
	reported volumes of production and associated values for other than marketed production.  
	In addition, information for several states which were unable to provide data was obtained 
	from Form EIA-176.  It should be noted that Form EIA-176 
	reports a fraction of state production.  The imputed value of marketed production in each  
	state is calculated by dividing the state's reported value by its associated production. 
	This unit price is then applied to the quantity of the state's marketed production to derive 
	the imputed value of marketed production.

    Average Wellhead Value, Preliminary Monthly Data: Preliminary values for the monthly U.S. natural gas wellhead price are estimated from the 
	New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures closing price for near-month delivery at the 
	Henry Hub, and prevailing cash market prices (spot prices) at 5 major trading hubs: 
	Henry Hub, LA; Carthage, TX; Katy, TX; Waha, TX; and Blanco, NM.  The NYMEX price is 
	reported in the trade publication, Gas Daily (published by Financial Times Energy).  
	The spot prices are published in another trade publication, 
	Natural Gas Week (Energy Intelligence Group), and they reflect the spot 
	delivered-to-pipeline, volume-weighted average prices for natural gas bought and sold at 
	the specified trading hubs. Prices include processing, gathering, and transportation fees 
	to the hubs. The estimated wellhead prices are derived with a statistical procedure based 
	on analysis of monthly time series data for the period 1995 through the present. A 
	statistical procedure was adopted beginning with publication of the February 1999 issue 
	of the Natural Gas Monthly. The preliminary estimates are replaced when annual survey 
	data become available, usually about 10 months after the end of the report year.

    Through 2010, natural gas production annual data were collected from 33 gas-producing states on Form EIA-895A which included gross withdrawals, vented and flared, repressuring, nonhydrocarbon gases removed, fuel used on leases, marketed production (wet), and extraction loss. In 2011 forward, the same data were obtained directly from the states. In instances where vented and flared, repressuring, nonhydrocarbon gases removed and fuel used on leases data were unavailable, EIA estimated these quantities by using the historic ratio of gross production to these items from previous years for each state. The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement also supplies data on the quantity and value of natural gas production on the Gulf of Mexico and Outer Continental Shelf.

     In many states, the marketed production volumes are larger than the reported wellhead value volumes. Differences in these volumes generally result from differences in definition and reporting requirements for separate data systems in the state. For example, while production quantities of federal, tribal, and state royalty gas are included in marketed production, some state reporting rules exclude these quantities from reported wellhead value volumes.
