  Respondents to the EIA-821 survey were instructed to report all volumes in
  accordance with what the product was sold as, regardless of the actual
  specifications of that product. For example, if a No. 2 distillate was sold
  as a heating oil or fuel oil, the volume would be reported in the category
  "No. 2 Fuel Oil" even if the product conformed to the higher specification of
  a diesel fuel.
