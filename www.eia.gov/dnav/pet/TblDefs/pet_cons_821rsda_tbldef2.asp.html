  <strong>Electric Power:</strong>
  National-level distillate and residual fuel oil electric power sales were calculated from
  annual aggregations of data collected on other forms.
  For years 1984 to 1999: the EIA-759, "Monthly Power Plant Report," and the 
  FERC-423, "Monthly Report of Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants" were used.
  Form EIA-759 consumption data for light oils include No 2. fuel oil, kerosene, and 
  jet fuel: the heavy oils include No. 4 fuel oil, residual fuel oil, and crude oil.  
  Using receipt data from Form FERC-423, No. 4 fuel oil receipts were deleted from the 
  heavy oil consumption data and added to the light oil consumption data.  The resultant 
  distillate (light oils) and residual (heavy oils) consumption data were added to 
  the stock change of light oils and heavy oils, respectively, from Form EIA-759 to 
  obtain the estimate of sales.
  For year 2000 data: the EIA-759, "Monthly Power Plant Report," FERC-423, 
  "Monthly Report of Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants," EIA-860B, 
  "Annual Electric Generation Report - Nonutility," and the EIA-900, "Monthly 
  Nonutility Power Report" were used.   Form EIA-759 collected consumption data for 
  light oils included No. 2 fuel oil, kerosene, and jet fuel; the heavy oils 
  include No. 4 fuel oil, residual fuel oil, and crude oil. Using receipt data 
  from Form FERC-423, the No. 4 fuel oil receipts were deleted from the heavy oil 
  consumption data and added to the light oil consumption data. The resultant 
  distillate and residual consumption data were added with Form EIA-860B distillate 
  and residual consumption data and the stock change of distillate and residual, 
  respectively, from Forms EIA-759 and EIA-900 to obtain the estimate.
  For year 2001 data: the EIA-906, "Power Plant Report" and FERC-423, "Monthly Report 
  of Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants" were used.  Form EIA-906 
  consumption data for distillate and residual was added to the stock change of 
  distillate and residual, respectively.  Using receipt data from Form FERC-423, 
  the No. 4 fuel oil receipts were deleted from the heavy oil consumption data and 
  added to the light oil consumption data.
  For years 2002 to present: the EIA-906, "Power Plant Report" was and is used.  
  Form EIA-906 utility and nonutility, NAICS 22 companies, consumption data was added 
  to the stock change of distillate and residual, respectively.  Allocations at the 
  State level were based on the EIA-821 survey.

  Foreign Trade, Bunker Fuels.  To account for all vessel bunkering including coastal 
  trade, the historically established ratios of total vessel bunkering use to foreign 
  trade use was determined for each PAD District and used to inflate the foreign trade 
  bunkering value.  Allocations at the State level were based on the EIA-821 survey 
  except for the States in PAD District 2.  For this region, which includes the Great 
  Lakes, the EIA-821 survey results were used since the Census report, based on the
