as having a boiling range of 122 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit at the 10 percent recovery point to 
365 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit at the 90 percent recovery point. Motor Gasoline includes 
conventional gasoline; all types of oxygenated gasoline, including gasohol; and 
reformulated gasoline, but excludes aviation gasoline. Note: Volumetric data on blending

the blending components are blended into the gasoline.</td>

  <td class="B2">Approximately represents consumption of petroleum products because it measures the 
disappearance of these products from primary sources, i.e., refineries, natural gas 
processing plants, blending plants, pipelines, and bulk terminals. In general, product 
supplied of each product in any given period is computed as follows: field production, plus 
refinery production, plus imports, plus unaccounted for crude oil, (plus net receipts when 
calculated on a PAD District basis), minus stock change, minus crude oil losses, minus refinery 
inputs, minus exports.

It conforms to ASTM Specifications D396 and D975 and Federal Specification VV-F-815C. 
No. 5, a residual fuel oil of medium viscosity, is also known as Navy Special and is defined in 
Military Specification MIL-F-859E, including Amendment 2 (NATO Symbol F-770). It is used in 
steam-powered vessels in government service and inshore powerplants. No. 6 fuel oil includes 
Bunker C fuel oil and is used for the production of electric power, space heating, vessel 
bunkering, and various industrial purposes.
