and reformulated) is classified by three grades - regular, midgrade, and 
premium. Note: gasoline sales are reported by grade in accordance with their classification 
at the time of sale. In general, automotive octane requirements are lower at high altitudes.
Therefore, in some areas of the United States, such as the Rocky Mountain States, the 
octane ratings for the gasoline grades may be 2 or more octane points lower.

as having a boiling range of 122 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit at the 10 percent recovery point to 
365 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit at the 90 percent recovery point. Motor Gasoline includes 
conventional gasoline; all types of oxygenated gasoline, including gasohol; and 
reformulated gasoline, but excludes aviation gasoline. Note: Volumetric data on blending

The two recognized laboratory engine test methods for determining the antiknock rating, i.e.,

single number as guidance to the consumer, the antiknock index (R + M)/2, which is the 
average of the Research and Motor octane numbers, was developed.

Note: Oxygenated gasoline excludes oxygenated fuels program reformulated gasoline (OPRG) 
and reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB). Data on gasahol that
has at least 2.7 percent oxygen, by weight, and is intended for sale inside CO nonattainment
