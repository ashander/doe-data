  Every Monday, retail prices for all three grades of gasoline are collected by telephone from a sample of approximately 800 retail gasoline outlets. The prices are published around 5:00 p.m. ET Monday, except on government holidays, when the data are released on Tuesday (but still represent Monday's price). The reported price includes all taxes and is the pump price paid by a consumer as of 8:00 A.M. Monday. This price represents the self-serve price except in areas having only full-serve. The price data are used to calculate weighted average price estimates at the city, state, regional and national levels using sales and delivery volume data from other EIA surveys and population estimates from the Bureau of Census.

  Every Monday, cash self-serve on-highway diesel prices (including taxes) are collected from a sample of approximately 400 retail diesel outlets in the continental U.S. The sample includes a combination of truck stops and service stations that sell on-highway diesel fuel. The data represent the price of ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) which contains less than 15 parts-per-million sulfur.  All collected prices are subjected to automated edit checks during data collection and data processing. Data flagged by the edits are verified with the respondents. Imputation is used for companies that cannot be contacted and for reported prices that are extreme outliers. The average survey response rate for 2012 was 99%.  Average national and regional prices are released around 5:00 p.m. ET on Mondays, except on government holidays, in which case the data are released on Tuesday (but still represent Monday's price).

Publication of Low Sulfur On-Highway Diesel (LSD) prices at the U.S. level was discontinued on December 8, 2008 due to a diminishing number of stations selling LSD as a result of <a href="http://epa.gov/otaq/fuels/dieselfuels/index.htm">EPA 
   Diesel Fuel Regulations</a>. EIA continued to collect LSD prices from retail outlets and included them in the Diesel Average All Types price until July 26, 2010, when no more outlets reported LSD sales. Beginning July 26, 2010 publication of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) price became fully represented by the Diesel Average All Types price. As of December 1, 2010 (September 1, 2006 in California), any on-highway diesel fuel sold is ULSD as mandated by EPA on-highway diesel fuel regulations.   </td>
