reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through 
surface separating facilities. Depending upon the characteristics of the crude 
stream, it may also include: 
<br>
<li>Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural 
underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric pressure after being 
recovered from oil well (casinghead) gas in lease separators and are subsequently 
commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured. Lease 
condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field 
separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included;  </li>

various metals;</li>
<li>Drip gases, and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, oil sands, 
gilsonite, and oil shale.</li>

Liquids produced at natural gas processing plants are excluded. Crude oil is refined to produce 
a wide array of petroleum products, including heating oils; gasoline, diesel and jet fuels; 
lubricants; asphalt; ethane, propane, and butane; and many other products used for their 
energy or chemical content.

removed where they occur in sufficient quantity to render the

  <td class="B1">Dry Natural Gas Production</td>
  <td class="B2">  The process of producing consumer-grade natural gas. Natural gas withdrawn from reservoirs is 
  reduced by volumes used at the production (lease) site and by processing losses. Volumes used at 
  the production site include (1) the volume returned to reservoirs in cycling, repressuring of oil 
  reservoirs, and conservation operations; and (2) gas vented and flared. Processing losses 
  include (1) nonhydrocarbon gases (e.g., water vapor, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen sulfide, 
  and nitrogen) removed from the gas stream; and (2) gas converted to liquid form, such as lease 
  condensate and plant liquids. Volumes of dry gas withdrawn from gas storage reservoirs are not 
  considered part of production. Dry natural gas production equals marketed production less 
  extraction loss.
