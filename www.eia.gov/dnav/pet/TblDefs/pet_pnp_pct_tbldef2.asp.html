It is calculated by dividing the sum of crude oil, hydrogen, other hydrocarbons, and net input of unfinished input into net production of each finished refinery product. Before calculating the yield for finished motor gasoline, subtract input of natural gas liquids, fuel ethanol, oxygenates, and net input of motor gasoline blending components from net production of finished motor gasoline. Before calculating the yield for finished aviation gasoline, subtract input of aviation gasoline blending components net production of finished aviation gasoline.  Before calculating the yield of distillate fuel oil, subtract input of renewable fuels except fuel ethanol (biodiesel, renewable diesel, and 'other' renewable fuels) from distillate fuel oil net production.

Refinery yield data prior to January 2009 were the percent of finished product produced from input of crude oil and net input of unfinished oils. It was calculated by dividing the sum of crude oil and net unfinished input into the individual net production of finished products. Before calculating the yield for finished motor gasoline, the input of natural gas liquids, other hydrocarbons and oxygenates, and net input of motor gasoline blending components were subtracted from net production of finished motor gasoline. Before calculating the yield for finished aviation gasoline, input of aviation gasoline blending components were subtracted from net production of finished aviation gasoline.
