<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Measuring
    Perceptions of Applying Alternative Disclosure Limitation Methods</u></strong><b>,</span></b> Jake Bournazian, SMG   Suppression
    is the most common method that federal agencies use to protect the
    confidentiality of reported data when releasing an information product.  During the past 15 years, alternative
    disclosure limitation methodologies have been developed for protecting tabular
    and <span class=SpellE>microdata</span>.  These methodologies offer new options in releasing data products for
    statistical agencies to protect the confidentiality of the reported data.  Although these alternative methods offer an
    improvement to the information loss caused by suppression, these methods impact
    the utility of the <span class=GramE>information</span> product to the data
    user.  Research is needed to measure the
    perceptions of the data user community and the survey respondents of applying
  alternative disclosure limitation methods to confidential EIA data.</span></p>
<p>ASA Committee Advice</span></p>
<p>The ASA Committee recommended
    collecting some preliminary information as a starting point. They indicated that it would be useful to
    know the perceptions of users and survey respondents on the current methodology
    of applying cell suppression to tabular data.  The Committee suggested that finding answers to preliminary questions
    would be useful in designing a study.  For example, do respondents understand the current practice of using
    cell suppression?  Also, do respondents
    care about which methodology is applied if the risk of re-identification is the
    same?  Answers to these questions could
    be collected inexpensively through telephone calls, focus groups, or EIA’s web
    site.   These qualitative approaches
    could also be used to explore the concerns and knowledge of users and
    respondents in this area.  If further
    investigation is warranted, this information would be useful in designing a
  study to collect data to measure perceptions.</span></p>
<p>EIA Intended Response to Committee Advice</span></p>
<p>EIA will consider various qualitative approaches to
    collect feedback from data users and survey respondents’ regarding the current
    methodology of applying cell suppression to protect the confidentiality of
    reported survey values.    The first step
    will be to select a target group to explore their concerns and knowledge
    concerning cell suppression methodology.   The second step will be to draft the questions to ask the target
    group.  Based on the information
    collected, EIA will then re-assess the need to collect statistical data for
  measuring data users’ and survey respondents’ perceptions on these issues.  </span></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>A New Oil
    Production Representation for the SAGE Model: Methodology and Producer Behavior
    Assumptions</u></strong><u><strong></span></strong></u> Justine Barden, John
  Staub, Glen Sweetnam, OIAF, EIA  </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3 align=left style='text-align:left'>EIA uses the System for the Analysis of Global Energy
    Markets (SAGE) model for its annual International Energy Outlook.  The model has 16 regions, and each has well
    defined demand, supply, technology, and import/export representations.  The SAGE oil production representation has
    received more scrutiny recently as world oil prices are approaching $70 per
    barrel.  Model results show that the
    current approach of using supply steps to represent oil production can over
    state the supply response of oil in a world where demand grows at an unexpected
  higher rate.</span></p>
<p>EIA plans to test a new oil
    production representation for the non-OPEC regions and examine the performance
    of the model in response to various demand and price scenarios.  For each time period, the new model will incorporate
    key factors such as exploratory drilling, reserve additions, development
    drilling, production per well, oil prices, optimal drilling activities, and
  resource constraints, in its dynamic production analysis.</span></p>
<p>This paper describes a
    linear/non-linear modeling methodology that EIA is considering and raises the
    issue of price expectation in the determination of optimal drilling and
    production activities.   The handling of
    price expectation may have profound effect on the projection of oil production
  and will be tested extensively when the model is fully operational.</span></p>
<p>ASA Committee Advice</span></p>
<p>The committee recommended that any assumptions in the
    oil representation be made explicit, with information on how sensitive the
    model results are to these assumptions.  The committee counseled careful use of the USGS resource estimates,
    which is the basis of the resource data used for the model.  The committee pointed out that we should be
    aware of the assumptions inherent in the USGS data, and that as the USGS
    estimates have grown over time we should specify how we account for this in
    using current estimates to forecast supply out 25 or more years.  Finally, as this model is still under
    development, the committee requested that we provided more details in the
  future that were not yet available.</span></p>
<p>EIA Intended Reaction to Committee Advice</span></p>
<p>EIA has received additional
    information from the contractor working on the model and is currently
  evaluating it before possibly soliciting further advice from the committee.</span></p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Improving the
  SAGE Petroleum Refinery Model</span></u></strong>,  John Staub, OIAF, Phillip Tseng, SMG, EIA</span></p>
<p>The EIA completed initial
    development of the System for the Analysis of Global Energy markets (SAGE) in
    early 2003.  The model is built on a
    liner programming platform and is solved for the least cost of meeting a
    predetermined set of energy service demand, period by period over a five year
    time interval from 2005 through 2030.  SAGE includes sixteen world demand and supply regions. For each region,
    there are four end-use demand sectors (commercial, industrial, residential,
    transportation), petroleum refining, power generation, and supply of both
    fossil fuels and renewable energy.  The
    structure of the SAGE is generic. A modeler can relatively easily increase the
    number of demands for energy services and introduce new technologies into the
  system.  </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Recent developments in the world market for crude oil
    and petroleum products prompted the need to enhance the refinery representation
    of the SAGE model.  The
  <st1:place w:st="on">
  <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  refinery acquisition cost (RAC)
  of crude oil rose from less than $26 per barrel in January 2000 to more than
  $55 in October 2005. Price differentials between light sweet and heavy sour
  also widened in the same period; in January 2000, the U.S. FOB cost of crude
  gravity 20 per cent or less was $20.78 per barrel and the same barrel for crude
  gravity 40.1 to 45% was $26.9 per barrel.  In October 2005, the cost was $44.21 and $59.24 for the heavy and light
    crude oils; differences in prices increased from about $6 per barrel in 2000 to
    more than $15 per barrel in 2005.  The
    increased price differentials reflect several important market
    interactions:  demand share for light
    products increased more than heavier products, supply of heavier crude oils was
    relatively more abundant than light crude oils, and refineries lack down stream
  capacities to process heavy crude oils.  </span></p>
<p>The world demand for
    petroleum products is projected to increase by almost 50 percent between 2005
    and 2030.  Most of the increase will be
    in gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.  The
    improved refinery representation will help EIA capture several important
    features of future petroleum market.  They include investment requirements, product pricing, product trade
    flow, price differential between light and heavy crude oils, and more
  reasonable forecast of long term supply of petroleum products.  </span></p>
<p>The key to developing a
    manageable refinery model is adding only the essential elements of refinery
    operations and minimize unnecessary details. The refinery representation needs
    to mimic only the essential physical structure of refineries. For example, an
    abstract representation may remove sulfur before rather than after
  distillation. </span></p>
<p>John Staub discussed (1)
    historical trends in worldwide and
  <st1:place w:st="on">
  <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  refinery capacity, crude oil
  inputs and refined petroleum product outputs, (2) the existing petroleum
  refinery methodology in the SAGE model, and (3) a proposed enhanced modeling
  approach for refineries. </span></p>
<p>ASA Committee Advice</span></p>
<p>The ASA Committee
    acknowledged that modeling worldwide petroleum refining is a difficult task
    because it is attempting to match a diverse slate of refinery inputs and
    outputs in multiple locations. The challenge is to introduce sufficient
    complexity to characterize the decision process in how the market operates, but
    not too much such that the model becomes unmanageable. Moreover, political
    decisions often override market economics in the refinery sector. The ASA
    Committee recommended that whatever level of refinery model detail was finally
    selected, EIA run the model multiple times with likely different parameters to
    see how sensitive the outcome is to the input parameters. This will provide
    insight into the sensitivity of the results to stochasticity in the model and
  its assumptions. </span></p>
<p>An outstanding issue for EIA
    is how much should EIA get into the business of talking about risk associated
    with doing business at different parts of the world, which is going to be one
    of the driving forces behind investments in these big capital-intensive
  projects.</span></p>
<p>EIA Intended Reaction to Committee
  Advice</span></p>
<p>EIA intends to follow the
    Committee’s advice to run the model multiple times with different parameters to
    estimate the model’s sensitivity to various parameters. In terms of the level
    of model complexity, EIA will test more detailed refinery representations as
  time permits. </span></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>2006 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS): Looking at Past Performance
    Statistics to Motivate New Methods of Collection,</u></strong><u></u><b> </span></b>Robert
  Adler and Tom Lorenz, EMEU, EIA </span></p>
<p>The paper and presentation
    looked at three aspects of the 2002 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey
    (MECS) to see what changes would be in order for the 2006 MECS. First, <span
class=GramE>a sample of data status flags were</span> examined to see what they
    showed about troublesome aspects of the questionnaire content. Second, the
    status flags data were compared for respondents who completed an Excel version
    of the questionnaires to the data for those respondents who completed a written
    version. Together, those two sections point to the desirability of an
    electronic version of the 2006 MECS. Finally, the presenters gave an
    examination of differential response and coverage-rates were made along with a
  description of non-response follow-up procedures.</span></p>
<p>ASA Committee Comments and General Discussion </span></p>
<p>Dr. Feder led the discussion
    by asking why we do the survey every four years and not do it continuously
  through the cycle by going to a portion of the sample every year. </span></p>
<p>There was then a lot of
    back-and-forth and group discussion about possible benefits of using the
    electronic MECS: cleaner data, less call backs. There was general agreement
    that this would be a helpful thing to have and that there is potential for cost
  and time savings.</span></p>
<p>The discussion then turned to
    response rates and the possibility of using incentives for respondents. One
    committee member talked about incentives she used for a facility study. The
    point-of-contact got a nice portfolio while related unidentified staff received
  a food incentive. She said that both could be obtained relatively cheaply.</span></p>
<p>Discussion turned briefly to
    the respondents’ capability to save incomplete survey work to Census Taker and
  return to it later. They will be able to do that.</span></p>
<p>The response rate discussion
    turned to the idea of coverage rates vs. traditional response rates. There was
    general agreement that the coverage rate is the more important measure for
    national level estimates. However, there was some concern that at the smaller
    area estimates or for sub-samples chosen by researchers using micro-data that
    the coverage rates may not be as relevant here. There was also some discussion
    about the type of non-respondents as well as the number and that we “stopped”
  our follow-up when we reached our coverage rate. (We do have some
  characteristics by size and NAICS and we also have written follow-ups before we
  go to the telephone.) It was suggested that we may experiment with the letters
  and the mandatory response to see if that can elicit a better response.</span></p>
<p>EIA’s Response to Committee Advice and Comments:</span></p>
<p>Regarding doing the survey on
    a continuous basis, the main hindrance is cost. The cost would not really be
    able to be split into fourths as certain operations require a base level of
    expenditure regardless of the size of the sample. Second, one would never have
    an actual yearly estimate in the same way; there would instead be a series of
    rolling averages. Then, splitting the sample in such a skewed population would
    be difficult. There are certain large refineries, chemical companies, and
    primary metal companies that would almost always have to be part of any sample
  to ensure accuracy of any estimate.</span></p>
<p>While those things are
    difficult to overcome, they may not be impossible. EIA would have to desire the
    changes enough to shoulder a rather large initial cost. We have also been
    exploring more compromise solutions like a large MECS every four or five years
    and a “mini-MECS” that would occur once or twice in the interim. The plan in
    this case is to field a small set of questions with a smaller sample size
    independently drawn. All of this becomes more possible if we can reduce the
    cost and time for one survey. We hope switching to an electronic form as the
  primary data collection mode will accomplish that.</span></p>
<p>Regarding response rates and
    non-response follow-up, EIA intends to keep the same general call-back
    procedure and to emphasize the coverage rate over the simple response rate.
    However, for the 2006 MECS, the sample will be drawn earlier so that the actual
    people responding at the establishment can be identified. They will be told
    about the merits of using the Census Taker version of the MECS and how to
    submit their data, no matter what mode they choose. In this way, we hope to
    identify many of the potential problems before the actual fielding of the
    survey. As for incentives, we will investigate cheap alternatives to mail to
  them at the time of the survey mail-out. </span></p>
<p>EIA will also reexamine the
    non-response follow-up letters that precede the telephone follow-up.  If alternative versions seem desirable, we
    may try an experiment to see which version of the follow-up letter achieves a
  better conversion rate.</span></p>
<p>(Check for duplication,
  above vs. below.)</span></p>
<p>EIA’s 2002 Manufacturing
    Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) data file has a wealth of “metadata” available
    in the <span class=SpellE>StEPS</span> database in which it is housed. For each
    data item collected or derived, a flag indicates whether the data is reported,
    corrected by analyst intervention, or the result of using an alternate data
    source. The number of analyst corrections for collected data items gives an
  indication of data quality. </span></p>
<p>This paper will present
    statistics for some key items that may indicate a problem in the wording of the
    question, conceptual understanding, or other problems in respondent reporting.
  This metadata examination will yield potential changes to the 2006 MECS. </span></p>
<p>The 2002 MECS also had an
    electronic option for reporting for certain classes of respondents. For those
    classes of respondents, we will compare the analyst intervention flags and
    other performance statistics between the electronic and non-electronic
    reporting groups. The results will be used to justify the use and clearance of
  an Internet Data Collection.</span></p>
<p>Performance statistics,
    especially non response statistics for industry and size classes, will be used
  to demonstrate the desirability of:</span></p>

  sample away from smaller respondents and allowing their weights to rise.</span></p>

  for 2006.</span></p>

<p><strong>8.  <u>Preliminary Research Results on Respondent
    Cut-off Dates for EIA Electricity Data Collections</u></strong> Howard Bradsher-Fredrick
    and Alethea Jennings, SMG, <span class=GramE>EIA  In</span> order to achieve high response rates
    on establishment surveys, EIA expends significant resources in administering
    non-response follow-up to those surveys.  For example, our analysis of the submission dates related to the
    EIA-860, <i>Annual Electric Generator Report,</i> shows that over 95% of the
    volume has been reported within two months of the deadline for submission while
    EIA continues to conduct non-response follow-up for over four months following
    the final deadline.  Considering
    tightening budgets, the issue can be raised as to whether EIA will be able to
    continue to expend significant resources to achieve near 100% coverage by
  volume.  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In
    order to make rational decisions on this issue, it is advisable to study past
    data collections to first assess when data had been submitted and to then
    determine the character of the respondents and lost respondents associated with
    an array of alternative cut-off dates.  This paper summarizes these preliminary analyses on 2004 submissions of
    EIA-861, <i>Annual Electric Power Industry Report</i>, and EIA-860, <i>Annual
    Electric Generator Report,</i> data.   In
    addition to overall summaries some analyses were also conducted on various
  strata important to data users.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In
    addition, we would like to discuss with the Committee some of the challenges,
    such as that both the EIA-861 and EIA-860 surveys are used as frames for sample
    surveys. We would also like to discuss plans for future analyses, such as the
    use of imputation to obtain data for the missing respondents.  We would like to get the Committee’s comments
    on the work we have done so far and on our plans.  Because this is work in progress, the paper
  may differ slightly from the abstract.</span></p>
ASA Committee Advice</span>
<p class=MsoBodyText>The ASA-Energy Committee discussed
    some ideas concerning how to handle the problem of late respondents and
    non-respondents on the EIA-860 and EIA-861 surveys. These ideas were generated
    in the context of a discussion more specifically about the use of alternative
    respondent cut-off dates.   The ideas of
  the Committee included the following:  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Is there really a
    need to release data at an earlier date?  The presentation focused on the cost to EIA of continuing to collect
    data for an extended period of time and consequently releasing data at a later
    date than would be required if an earlier cut-off date were employed. The
    Committee posed the question of the cost to EIA data users, “Is there a
    significant research cost to EIA’s data users to wait as long as they presently
    do to release the data for the EIA-860 and EIA-861?”  If not, maybe EIA should not change its
  procedures.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Telephone
    interviews could be conducted in order to help identify the primary causes of
  late responses to these surveys and remedies could perhaps be identified.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    non-respondents (after a specified cut-off date) could be sampled rather than
    trying to elicit responses from all non-respondents.  This could enable EIA to concentrate their
    resources on a few non-respondents with greater vigor.  However, it was pointed out by EIA that it is
    very important to receive data from as many respondents as possible since the
    EIA-861 data, in particular, is very important for other surveys.  For example, the results of the EIA-861 are
    used for imputation purposes involving the EIA-826 (a monthly survey of a
    sample of the EIA-861 frame).  Thus,
  sampling non-respondents would cause poorer results on other surveys.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;

style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>EIA could conduct
    a cost/benefit analysis of what is gained and lost by not collecting the last
  1, 5 or 10% of volume.</span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>EIA could think
    more about their approach on repeated contacts to bring in more completed
  surveys earlier in the process.</span></p>

font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>EIA could
    investigate mechanisms for reducing the cost of non-response follow-up.  For example, repeat offenders could be
    identified as part of an approach to solving the problem of untimely
    submissions.   As part of an effort to
    obtain their completed surveys earlier in the year, resources could be
    dedicated to assisting respondents in identifying and resolving, if possible,
  the issues that contribute to the lack of timeliness in their data submissions.</span></p>
EIA Response to Committee Advice</span>
<p class=MsoBodyText>EIA was already aware of
    the ideas presented by the Committee on this issue.  It was, however, interesting to discuss these
    issues again.  The presenters will
    review, make any necessary changes and submit their paper to CNEAF management.
    This document could be useful in the event that the issue of early cut-off of
    non-respondents or other related issues (e.g., sampling a portion of the small
  respondents on a rotating basis) are again raised in the future.  </span></p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Functional
    Requirements for EIA’s Internet Data Collection System</span></u></strong><u></u><b>, </span></b>Stanley R. Freedman, SMG, <span class=GramE>EIA  An</span> EIA team has been working to develop
    functional requirements for an EIA-wide Internet Data Collection (IDC)
    system.  These requirements will serve as
    a basis for developing an IDC that will meet the needs of EIA’s respondents,
    and survey managers.  The work of the
    team is nearing completion as reflected in the accompanying PowerPoint
    presentation given to the Goal 4 subcommittee for EIA’s Strategic Plan.  The team would like input from the ASA
  Committee on the requirements we have developed to this point.</span></p>
<p>Summary of Committee Comments
  &amp; Advice </span></p>
<p>The committee felt that EIA
    was taking the correct approach to developing requirements for an Internet Data
    Collection System.  They believed that
    the functional areas were adequately addressed.  Most of their comments and suggestions related to interaction between
    respondents and the IDC.  Many of their
  suggestions had already been addressed in the functional requirements document.</span></p>
<p>The Committee had the
  following specific concerns and suggestions.</span></p>
<p>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> One committee member had some concerns about
    protecting the confidentiality of retrieving historical information from the
    data base.  Specifically, if a company
    was bought, sold, or partially acquired by another company would there be any
  way to safeguard unauthorized access to historical information</span></p>

    a company’s data through the IDC is controlled by a user ID and password.  EIA has no control over who in the company is
    granted access to that password, or whether multiple people in a company have
    the ability to access the IDC.  If a
    respondent has concerns about access to historical data by its own staff, we
    will look at ways of disabling that functionality for that particular
    respondent. This may not be technically possible.  EIA will also need to look at the impact it
    has on the on-line editing functionality and any other impacts on other
  functional requirements.</span></i></p>
<p>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The committee suggested that some form of a
    respondent feedback questionnaire be available to get feedback from
  respondents.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Response</span></i></b><i> – EIA thinks
    this is a good idea and will complement the required usability testing.  We will explore the most appropriate way of
  administering that questionnaire.</span></i></p>
<p>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The committee
    asked whether respondents would be notified if their data were changed after
  submission to EIA.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Response</span></i></b><i> – This is
    not a functionality of the IDC.  The
    changes to which the committee is referring take place during the survey
    follow-up and data cleaning periods and are a function of specific survey
    operations.  Some surveys do routinely
    notify their respondents if they change a submission.  It does impact the IDC however, in those
    instances where a respondent sees or has access to their historical data.  If a respondent sees a data value in the IDC
    that it did not submit, it will cause concern and confusion.  EIA must examine this issue and provide a
    mechanism for notifying respondents of changes to their submissions, although
  that notification may be outside the IDC.</span></i></p>
<p>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The committee
    suggested that there be functionality in the IDC for companies to be able to
    transmit their data directly to EIA in a prescribed format, compiled from their
  data bases, rather than having to key data into browser screens.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Response</span></i></b><i> – This
    functionality will be part of the IDC.  Once the data are received by EIA, they will be loaded into the IDC so
    that the on-line edits can be run.  Respondents who submit this way will then have to be called to resolve
  those flags.</span></i></p>
<p>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The committee
    thought it would be a good idea to have “tailor” technical assistance for the
    IDC.  By this, the committee meant that
    there needed to be assistance to handle IT related questions, general survey
  issues, and questions on specific items on the survey.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Response</span></i></b><i> – There are
    several types of assistance that will be part of the IDC.  The first is a help line dedicated to
    providing assistance with the single sign-on system, and other strictly IT
    issues which span all the surveys in the IDC.  The second type of help line will be survey specific.  Each survey or group of surveys will have a
    number that respondents can use to ask questions about specific data
    elements.  These are subject matter related
    questions and not appropriate for IT to answer.  In addition to these human interfaces there will be extensive built-in
    help in the IDC itself.  This help will
    be survey specific, but will link a user to assistance for specific data items,
  definitions of terms or guidance in completing the survey.  This help will be survey specific.</span></i></p>
<p>F.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The committee
    thought it is important for respondents to receive feedback on their status of
  data submission.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Response</span></i></b><i> – Feedback
    functionality will exist in the IDC.  When
    a respondent submits their data to EIA they will receive immediate notification
    that their data have been submitted.  Secondly, they will receive a confirmation email that their data have
    been received at EIA.  Surveys in the IDC
    will, at the option of the survey manager, have progress bars to show how much
  of the survey has been completed.</span></i></p>
<p>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One of the most
    significant comments we got from the committee was to explore what value added
    features we can add to the IDC for respondents.  Without providing some benefit to respondents to switch from their
    current reporting mode it may be difficult to bring participation levels up to
  desired levels</span></p>
<p><b><i>Response</span></i></b><i> – The IDC
    team has discussed this issue several times over the development of the
    functional requirements.  We believe it
    is important to address this issue to increase participation.  Clearly one incentive is that the respondent
    may receive fewer calls from EIA about data anomalies.  Other suggests for incentives could include
    special reports and tabulations of a companies data <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>vis</span></span> a <span class=SpellE>vis</span> other aggregated
    survey respondents.  We will include the
    development of these incentives in the implementation plan and explore them
  with respondents during the testing phase.</span></i></p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <u>An Empirical Evaluation of the
    Relationship Between Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices,</u></strong><u></u> Jose A. Villar, OOG,
  EIA</span></p>
<p>This paper sought to develop
    an understanding of the salient characteristics of the economic and statistical
    relationship between oil and gas prices.   This analysis identifies the economic factors suggesting how crude oil
    and natural gas prices are related, and assesses the statistical significance
    of the relationship between the two over time. A vector error correction model
    is estimated to distinguish between long-run and short run effects of changes
    in natural gas prices on oil prices, and vice-versa.  A significant stable relationship between the
    two price series is identified.  Oil
    prices are found to influence the long run development of natural gas prices,
  but are not influenced by them.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The
    purpose of the analysis was to examine the time series econometric relationship
    between the Henry Hub natural gas price and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
    crude oil price. Typically, this relationship has been approached using simple
    correlations and deterministic trends. When data have unit roots as in this
    case, such analysis is faulty and subject to spurious results. The analysis
    found a co-integrating relationship relating Henry Hub prices to the WTI and a
    trend capturing the relative demand and supply effects over the 1989 through
    2005 period. The dynamics of the relationship suggest a 1 month temporary shock
    to the WTI of 20 percent has a 5 percent contemporaneous impact on natural gas
    prices, but is dissipated to zero in two months. A permanent shock of 20% in
    the WTI leads to a 15% increase in the Henry Hub price one year out all else
  equal.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The
    analysis was presented to the Committee to get input on the econometric
    modeling, and to explore the implications of the Vector Error Correction Model
  (VECM) for EIA forecasting efforts. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Committee Advice:</span></p>
<p>In general, the Committee
    encouraged EIA to continue and expand efforts in similar state of the art time
    series analysis techniques.  With respect
    to the analysis of the relationship between oil and gas prices, the Committee
    expressed considerable interest in the time trend term that was used in the
    model, and suggested that further work should be done to investigate what the
  real-world phenomena are underlying the time trend term in the model.</span></p>
<p>EIA Intended Reaction to Committee Advice:</span></p>
<p>The current research
    analysis, as presented to the ASA, will be completed and published.  EIA will utilize the report to examine
    opportunities to use what has been learned in its forecasting efforts.  A future study of oil and gas prices will be
    considered to analyze the nature of the time trend, and attempt to determine
  what is driving this significant link between crude oil and natural gas prices. </span></p>
