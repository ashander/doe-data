<p> This is an unedited Transcript of the Fall Meeting of the Energy Information 
  Administration and the American Statistical Association Committee on Energy 
  Statistics. </p>
<p>The meeting took place October 16 and 17, 2003 in the Forrestal Building at 
  1000 Independence Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585. Most of the sessions were 
  in 8E-089, although several break out sessions were in 5E-069. After the break 
  on Friday morning, the 2 remaining sessions were moved to Room 6098 at 950 L&#8217;Enfant 
  Plaza. This room change was due to an expected fire drill.</p>
