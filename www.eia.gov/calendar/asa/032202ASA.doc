Please use the microphone.
\par \tab \tab MR. BRADSHER-FREDRICK: I'm Howard Bradsher-Fredrick.  I'm with EIA with the Statistics and Methods Group.
\par \tab \tab MR. RODEKOHR: I'm Mark Rodekohr, with Energy Markets and End Use.
\par \tab \tab MR. GRILLOT: Mike Grillot, EIA, International Energy Statistics.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Let's see.  Lunch for the committee will be held at the same place it was yesterday, downstairs in Room 1E-226, and at this time we'll discuss this meeting and suggest topics for the next meeting.
\par \tab \tab Also, I'd like to remind you that every June or July the Chair of the ASA Committee on Energy Statistics gets an invitation to organize an invited session of the Joint Statistical Meeting.  You might recall that we had one that we organized for this year in New York, so we'll get the opportunity to organize another one, and that's San Francisco.  It's a really good opportunity for us to have a session on topics of interest.
\par \tab \tab Randy, we were even thinking that maybe you, as a student, would be far enough along that you might like that opportunity.  So anyway, I'm taking suggestions for putting together an invited paper session for that.
\par \tab \tab And then finally before I turn it over to Lowell, it looks like we are trying to schedule the dates for the fall meeting for October 24}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super th}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and 25}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super th}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .  So far, that seems to be good for everybody in this room, but, of course, we need to check hotel availability and with some of the other committee members.  So, Bill will probably let you know within the next couple of weeks to confirm that.
\par \tab \tab So now, I'll turn it over to Lowell Feld, and he's going to talk to you about the Energy Situation Analysis Report.
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Good morning, I'm Lowell Feld, and I'm here today to give you a brief overview of the Energy Situation Analysis Report, also known as the ESAR.
\par \tab \tab What I plan to do today is to give you a little history on the two past ESARs that EIA has produced, and then to review the current ESAR.  My colleague and ESAR co-author, Tara Billingsley, is also here today to do the tough job of changing the slides and also to help answer any questions you might have, and especially the really hard ones.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Anyway, I guess the first most obvious question might be why are we doing an ESAR and why now, and I think those are some good questions.  
\par \tab \tab Well, here's a mini mission statement that I've developed to help clarify my own thinking on the matter. Given the current uncertain world situation EIA stands ready for any possible energy emergency, and ESAR is an important part of this ongoing effort.
\par \tab \tab So, hopefully, it's clear, concise, and maybe even a little bit inspirational, because by all indications the war on terrorism could last a long time.  Also, we really don't know what impact this will have on U.S. or world energy markets, or if there will be future terrorist attacks or military action against the important energy infrastructure.
\par \tab \tab So, for now we are keeping our options open by following the old Boy Scout's oath, "Be prepared."
\par \tab \tab Also, by doing an ESAR twice per week our goal is to stay sharp, so that if the situation does worsen we will be ready to respond to any and all eventualities.
\par \tab \tab A little historical background.  This is the third major ongoing ESAR that EIA has produced, and my colleague, Eric Crail, who I don't believe is here today, has pointed out that EIA also has created several one-time only ESARs in response to various energy emergencies over the years, but this is the third major ongoing ESAR that EIA has produced.
\par \tab \tab The first major ESAR was put together during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990-1991.  In fact, it was just after Doctor Kent's arrival at EIA, I was talking to him yesterday, I think it was one day after his arrival at the EIA, sort of a baptism by fire for the new administrator.
\par \tab \tab The second major ESAR was in the weeks leading up to and following the Y2K "rollover" event at the end of 1999 and early 2000, and then this would be the third major ESAR in response to the terrorist attacks, of course, of 9/11, and specifically they are in response to the sort of U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan of October 7}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super th}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .  And, the ESAR actually started three days later on October 10}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super th}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .
\par \tab \tab Again, the first ESAR was produced in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which took place on August 1, 1990.  This came as a total surprise to us, not to Saddam Hussein, of course, so anyway we had to scramble to respond.  But, within just a day or two we were producing an ESAR which became fairly routine as time went by, and which we continued to produce until March 4, 1991, a few days after the end of the war.
\par \tab \tab I believe that this experience illustrates, among other things, how quickly EIA can produce an ESAR, even from scratch if it has to do so.
\par \tab \tab Since this event was exclusively an oil supply disruption, and since other fuels were not directly affected, the focus of the Desert Storm ESAR was strictly on oil.  At that time, which seems like ancient history now, 11-1/2 years ago, it makes me feel kind of old, the internet was in its infancy.  EIA didn't even have a web site, how primitive can you get, and so we distributed the ESAR the hard, old-fashioned way, by mail, broadcast fax machines, whatever that is, I talked to John Weiner yesterday about that one, I still don't understand it, hand delivery, Pony Express, you name it.  Well, actually, Federal Express, but anyway, using all these means we managed to distribute around 1,000 copies per day of the ESAR to Congress, to top state government officials, top federal government officials, the private sector, and the general public.
\par \tab \tab What we feel like we accomplished with all this was in keeping people well informed as to the facts of the situation, such as the difference between the gross oil supply disruption and the net oil supply disruption, which in this case made a huge difference.  Thus, the gross oil supply disruption, for instance, caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, was about 4.3 million barrels per day, and that lasted throughout the whole crisis, which was about six months.
\par \tab \tab The net oil supply disruption, on the other hand, was made up for very quickly by excess oil production capacity from Saudi Arabia and other countries, within a matter of a few weeks or at the most two months, which meant that there was, essentially, no net oil supply disruption for, basically, the whole crisis, even though the gross oil supply disruption continued.
\par \tab \tab And, it's by explaining this type of information to the public, I feel that EIA helped in that case and can help in general, at least in a small way, to help calm the markets and to prevent panic.
\par \tab \tab The second major ESAR that EIA produced was for the Y2K "rollover" situation in late `99 and early 2000, and this lasted about five weeks, from November 29, 1999 until January 6, 2000.  Now, since the Y2K situation had the potential to affect any and all fuels the focus of this ESAR was on possible Y2K "rollover" vulnerabilities in all of the different energy sectors, as well as on preparations domestically and worldwide, to avoid any Y2K-related energy problems.  And, the Y2K ESAR was distributed primarily via the EIA web site, which by this point actually existed, had existed for about five years, and through which the ESAR reached about 150 to 200 people per day.
\par \tab \tab So, that brings us up to today and to the current ESAR, which we produce twice per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Since the current world situation is so broad and uncertain, sort of like with the Y2K situation, this ESAR covers all the fuels with a flexibility to focus on one or more of those fuels as events warrant.  For instance, if there is a problem with Iraq, just hypothetically of course, the focus of this ESAR could shift to more of oil and less of the other fuels, or if there were an attack on a nuclear facility in the United States, natural gas pipeline, or even a coal mine, whatever, we could quickly shift our focus more towards that.  The key here is flexibility.
\par \tab \tab For now, though, the ESAR contains information on energy prices, supply, demand, inventories for all the fuels, oil, gas, coal and also electricity.
\par \tab \tab Although my personal focus is world oil markets, the job of the Office of Energy Markets and End Use is to integrate input from all of the different EIA fuel offices and to produce the ESAR.  Tara and I also are responsible for writing the latest World Energy Market Development section, which is basically an executive summary, plus the World Oil Market section, as well as the "Special Topic" report.
\par \tab \tab The World Oil Market section includes information on world oil supply and demand, excess oil production capacity, and oil import sources for the United States and our major allies.  Also for oil, the ESAR includes analysis, data tables and graphics on U.S. supplies, demands and prices, and this is courtesy of the Office of Oil and Gas.
\par \tab \tab For natural gas, we receive updates twice per week from the Natural Gas Division, including latest developments, analysis and graphics on gas inventories and prices.
\par \tab \tab Coal information is updated once per week, on Thursdays, and also includes analysis and a price chart, and this input is provided by the Office of Coal, Nuclear, Electric and Alternate Fuels, or CNEAF. I've got to get that right, it's a long name.
\par \tab \tab Electricity is updated twice per week, and also mainly includes price information, and this is also provided by CNEAF.  And finally, we've got space for the "Special Topic" report, which up until now has dealt mainly with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and, specifically, it's draw down capability in the event of an oil supply disruption or, specifically, a shortfall.  But, the "Special Topic" section is flexible, and could easily cover other topics as need by or as requested.
\par \tab \tab How does EMEU put the ESAR together?  Actually, it's magic, but, seriously, every Tuesday and Thursday we receive inputs from the other EIA offices by around noon, hopefully earlier, and in the meantime Tara and I are skinning the wires for the latest world energy development and breaking news. By early afternoon, the ESAR is ready to be sent out internally for EIA analysts to review, then at about 4:00 p.m., each day the ESAR goes to the EMEU office director, Cal Kilgore, who is not here today, actually, Mark Rodekohr as well, my division director, and they review it, suggest edits, or more frequently say you did a great job as always, looks good, and this is perfect, right?
\par \tab \tab MR. RODEKOHR: No.
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: No.  Oh, well, I wish.
\par \tab \tab Anyway, Cal and Mark then send the report forward to the EIA front office, and finally around 5:30 p.m., after we }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  actually usually Tara, because she stays later than I do, have incorporated the front office's comments, if any, the ESAR is put out on the EIA web site.
\par \tab \tab How is the ESAR disseminated?  Okay.  Right now, exclusively via the EIA web site.  The ESAR is listed at the top of the EIA Feature Topic sidebar on the EIA home page, and the URL, if you are interested, is on the screen behind me.
\par \tab \tab Although the ESAR currently is distributed only over the EIA web site, it could be disseminated via hard copy, fax, carrier pigeon, get the idea, if desired or needed, and, of course, if I could on scratch at some carrier pigeons that would help.
\par \tab \tab Anyway, at present we haven't kicked in use of the automatic e-mail notification system or a LISTSERV, but we could do so quickly if management decided that it wanted to.  Still, we are getting about 300 visits per day to the ESAR, which is not bad. However, if we utilize LISTSERV and some of the other tools at our disposal it's likely this number could shoot up significantly, possibly even into the thousands.  And, I say this because the report that I work on, the Country Analysis Brief, which does utilize the LISTSERV and other tools, receives about 6,000 visits per day.
\par \tab \tab Finally, I'd be interested in soliciting your feedback on the ESAR, and these are just, I have a few questions that I've had on my mind and would be curious to hear your comments about.
\par \tab \tab First, is the ESAR accomplishing what EIA wants it to accomplish?
\par \tab \tab Second, is the ESAR being produced at the appropriate frequency, twice per week at present. 
\par \tab \tab Third, does the ESAR contain the appropriate content, given the nature of the current crisis?
\par \tab \tab Fourth, is the ESAR format optimal?
\par \tab \tab Fifth, is the ESAR reaching the intended audience?
\par \tab \tab Sixth, are the customers satisfied?
\par \tab \tab And, last but not least, how long will we continue to produce the ESAR?
\par \tab \tab So, as I've said, I'm open to your suggestions, comments, questions, and I thank you very much for your time and attention.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Our discussant will be Calvin Kent.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: I hope this doesn't wind up being longer than the presentation.  Seeing Mark Rodekohr up there brings back lots of old memories of those first ESARs that came out.
\par \tab \tab Let me give you some background, because I think understanding the background behind the first ESARs is going to be important in hearing the comments that I'm going to make later.
\par \tab \tab The specific event that brought about the ESAR, the first one, was, of course, the spike in crude oil prices that followed the invasion of Kuwait.  Now you have to remember that the winter before we had gone through a severe spike, particularly, in distillate, heating oil, propane and so forth, that had led to much discussion, clamors by states' attorney generals for anti-trust actions, and there was a great deal of discussion in the five months that I waited for confirmation, remember that, John, about these issues.  And so, there was a general fear there was another price spike going to take place, that EIA needed to respond in real time to see what we could do to dampen the expectations which were running rampant.
\par \tab \tab So, you have to remember that political context.  ESAR had actually been an internal document in EIA, and the decision was whether or not we were going to put it a more formal format and distribute it more widely.  And, that decision was made very quickly, simply because of the fact that we were being inundated, literally inundated, and I'm talking about literally hundreds of requests for immediate data and immediate analysis, primarily from other federal agencies, but specifically from Congress and from the media.  I don't even remember how many it was, but it was an avalanche of requests for information, and, basically, the information that was being requested was pretty much the same.
\par \tab \tab And so, the decision was made to reach a much wider audience much more quickly, by putting out the ESAR to deal with the most frequently asked questions concerning the crisis.
\par \tab \tab There were two immediate constituencies.  The first, and most immediate, constituency was, of course, Congress and congressional staff, because this was where we were getting the most inquiries.  Every congressman and senator wanted to appear to their constituents that they were on top of the situation, that they knew what was going on, they wanted to have the latest information.  
\par \tab \tab The second biggest constituency was the media, because in times of any sort of crisis the media wants to have stories, they want to have information, they need to get out those in-depth, 300 second analyses that they do, and so we were in a position where we were trying to supply to the media information that could be used for everything from the nightly news to talk shows.
\par \tab \tab Definitely, a secondary constituent for this was the traders in the marketplace, those individuals who needed to have some sort of information to make decisions about trading, particularly, energy futures, but that was not the primary constituency for the first ESAR.
\par \tab \tab I should point out to you all that the original issuing of the ESAR was very, very controversial within EIA.  It was not that there was a unanimous decision that, yes, this is a great idea, go out and do it, quite to the contrary.  EIA had never done anything like this before, and it violated most of the hallowed principles of EIA, and that was that we were slow, we were deliberative, we checked all of our facts, we had the analysis going through what we called level one reviews, the whole thing was, to politely say, ponderous in terms of getting a report out, to make sure that it had received as much review as possible, that the data was absolutely as accurate as it possibly could be, and all of a sudden we are now talking about doing something in real time, which was a complete violation of EIA's corporate culture.
\par \tab \tab And so, there was considerable opposition.  We never had a vote, I never asked my faculty to take votes as the dean, I never asked the people in EIA to take a vote as to whether or not we ought to do something.  I'm sure it would have failed if we had put it to a vote, but we went ahead and did it anyway, recognizing that it was something entirely new, and those issues still remain with today's ESAR, because it's not, even though it is reviewed internally, it does not receive the same level of review.  It also relies heavily upon secondary sources of information, much more so than the typical EIA publications and output does.
\par \tab \tab And so, having said that, I think you can begin to see that this launched us in a new direction.  We also began flying by the seat of our pants.  We had no clear policy as to what it should contain, how it should be put together, when it should end, what constituted a crisis, none of these things were discussed in advance.
\par \tab \tab As I said this morning, my sainted grandmother used to always talk about folks being all hell and no notion, and that was really kind of where we were with the first ESAR.  And so, it evolved into something, rather than actually having been planned and thought through in advance.
\par \tab \tab So far as the second ESAR, the Y2K one, I have some serious doubts about why that one was even put out, to be quite frank about it.  I went back and looked at some of those.  I assume that it was in response to the press hype that was developing at the time about the possible catastrophes of Y2K if all the computers shut down, and it may have been somewhat useful in damping some of the speculations there, particularly, about how electric supply vulnerability might have been affected, and I think there was some interesting information that might have had some effect on the market, but in my opinion it was too little and too late to have really made a significant contribution to whatever the goal or the objective was.
\par \tab \tab Now, let's tell you a little bit of the current ESAR.  I think that it was important because of the confusion that was created by the events of 9/11.  At first, it was very difficult to see what the tie would be to energy markets, but as the nationalities became known of the individuals that had flown the airplanes then, of course, the feedback was that these were Middle Eastern individuals, many of them with Saudi Arabian ties, and, therefore, there was an indirect possible link to oil markets, and that there was the possibility also of actions against nuclear power plants and maybe other energy facilities such as refineries within the United States, and uncertainty always can lead to higher prices in energy markets.
\par \tab \tab It is not clear to me why discussion of some of the other fuels was included in the ESAR, nor is it clear from reading those, actually, why they were included, and I would like to know what the rationale was for that.
\par \tab \tab I asked myself as I was preparing these comments, as one looked at the ESAR, you know, why was I looking at it, and it occurred to me that the reason I was looking at it was because it saved me a lot of thinking.  I was able to get a very quick overview of what was going on in world markets, so if I was asked to speak to the Rotary Club, or make a comment to the press, or something like that, I could do so very, ver easily.  But, I began to wonder if the current ESAR is too much for those who want it quick and dirty, and it's too little for those who want to have more and to make major decisions.
\par \tab \tab To me, the most valuable part of it was the executive summary and the special topics, both of which Lowell has claimed credit for doing, and so I throw him a bouquet for that one.
\par \tab \tab What my basic problem was is, I don't think the ESAR has clearly in mind what its constituency was, and that would lead to my answers to the questions and my comments, and it may very well be that this is all going on, and from what Lowell just said there may be something there, but I do think that EIA needs to establish a policy and procedures for the ESAR, that they need to know in advance are you going to issue it and under what circumstances, and when the end date is going to be.
\par \tab \tab You also have to find out very clearly, because the question is up here, is it doing what its readers want it to do, is it accomplishing what EIA needs and wants it to do, I have no idea what it is that EIA wants it to do, and so the EIA needs to answer that question for itself.  What do we want out of this?  Do we want to have a twice weekly publication that uses secondary sources, that does not go through the same level, high level of review, that other EIA publications do.  And, I think in its current format it is really coming out as almost a weekly, and, therefore, do we want to add a permanent weekly publication, and I'm not denigrating it by saying it's of low quality, but of this quality, and have it as part of the continuing operation, because I'm not sure what the rationale is right now for continuing, other than the world is an uncertain place and maybe we need to be responding to that.
\par \tab \tab But, what I'm saying is, is that EIA needs to become intentional about the ESAR.  They need to have a very clear policy.  It's obvious to me that they have put together a team to put it together, to get it out.  I think that team needs to be longstanding, or almost like a volunteer fire department, that they are well trained, they are ready to go when they should be called upon, but again, I come back to the point, and I will make it for the third time, and that is simply that EIA needs to really have decided and to be public and intentional about what it is that the ESAR is supposed to accomplish, because it's clear to me that the ESAR has morphed from its beginning, and it has morphed in terms of who it was to serve and what its content was supposed to be, and that may not be bad, but like a science fiction movie, when something morphs you sometimes don't know what it's going to look like in its next iteration and that is where I think that we are having problems currently with the ESAR.
\par \tab \tab So, let's see if I've got a few concluding remarks here that I want to make.  Yes, I think that EIA needs to develop a policy.  I think they need to develop some guidelines.  I think they need to define their constituency.  I was somewhat surprised to find out they were not using the congressional LISTSERV, because this used to be the most important constituency, and I think it would still be the most important constituency.  If nothing more, at least you are letting Congress know, hey, we are on top of things and we're visible.
\par \tab \tab So, what I'm saying is, is that I think EIA needs to do some hard thinking about the ESAR, develop some policies, develop some guidelines, and ask themselves these same questions before they ask them of us.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Lowell, do you have some comments for Calvin, or questions?
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: I think he's brilliant.
\par \tab \tab No, I agree with everything he said, in fact, I talked to him for a while yesterday at lunch about this, and I think he's right on.
\par \tab \tab I think that there is a value, potentially, for a weekly report that EIA would put out, a sort of a "This Week In Energy," and that would be a BAU report.  We have a massive amount of material on our web site, and that's good, but I get a lot of calls from customers who are lost and can't find what they are looking for, and I guide them to wherever.  Usually, I can help them.  But, some people just want, in five minutes, to know what is going on here, you know, in all the different fuels, and I think the ESAR actually does a very good job in that respect.
\par \tab \tab As a contingency product, since I work for the International Contingency Group, I'm not sure where it's at exactly on that one.  What is the crisis?  Doctor Kent brought that up.  The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was clear, there was an oil supply disruption.  The Y2K was kind of nebulous, but there was a feeling out there that could be a catastrophe.  People were stockpiling canned goods and living in Idaho or whatever, but this one }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Even a few in West Virginia.
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD:  }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and West Virginia.  Were you stockpiling canned goods?
\par \tab \tab Anyway, so anyway, I think Doctor Kent makes some excellent points, and we have been now doing this for about six months.  So, it's a good time maybe to step back and think a little bit, probably good timing for this meeting here.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Okay, thank you.
\par \tab \tab Are there any other comments or questions?
\par \tab \tab Jim?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: Yes.  I was }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  actually, Cal's comments clarified a lot of things, but one thing I wasn't clear about is where you get the data to do this, and that sort of relates to questions he raised of sort of timeliness, and frequency, versus accuracy, and whether in the presentation you can and want to do something so readers sort of implicitly know what this is based on, and differentiate that from what some of the other reports, which are based on direct surveys and so forth, a more careful analysis and editing and so forth are based on.
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: Yes.  That's an interesting point. A lot of the information that's contained in the ESAR, and this is actually another issue, is actually already out on the EIA web site.  For example, a lot of the oil, weekly oil discussion, is, basically, "This Week In Petroleum," it's a relatively new product that the Office of Oil and Gas is putting out, and it's pretty much word for word.  We don't really change it.
\par \tab \tab The same thing with the other fuels, the graphics and the tables that we receive from CNEAF and Oil and Gas, Tara and I pretty much take those, plot them into the ESAR, we look, we read it over, but, you know, if you want to know where the data comes from you need to }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  you almost need to ask }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  you do need to ask the people in those individual areas, coal, electric, gas, they have surveys.  I mean, I know to some extent.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: Right, but they don't have weekly surveys, or bi-weekly surveys.
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: Well, some do, actually.  They do, there are price surveys, there are weekly reports.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: Well then, the question is, is it fair for a reader to say this came from EIA, I should treat this as being sort of equivalent in quality to the Annual Energy Outlook?
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: I think it's a good point.  I mean, there is a mixture of material that we include in the ESAR, including, like I said, we scan the wires for news stories, that's secondary.  I mean, obviously, that's not EIA material.  And then, there are table and graphics which really are derived from surveys that EIA conducts, so I would say that's primary EIA information. 
\par \tab \tab Maybe it would be a good idea to label that more clearly.  I don't know, we can certainly take that under advisement.
\par \tab \tab MS. BILLINGSLEY: There's also a lot of price information, which, I mean, it's on the NYMEX, you can look it up for yourself, you know, so a lot of that information, we are just reporting it back and we're pretty sure that whatever the closing price is on that that can still be true tomorrow.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: So, you're saying it's a repackaging of things that are there anyway, which I think is plausible, the weekly thing going out, "This Week In Energy," might well be a useful continuation.
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: Yes.  I mean, I keep touting it because I work on this, but the Country Analysis Briefs, I mean, basically, there's nothing new in a way in those reports.  They are wildly popular, why?  Well, I think the main reason, more than anything, is there is a massive amount of information out there, you know, you can just slog through it.  Most people aren't going to do that.  So, we do that for them, we boil it down into a six-page report, easy to read, five, ten minutes you can have a clue as to what's going in in fill-in-the-blank country, and, obviously, that's what people want.
\par \tab \tab They also do, some people do want to dig down and get into, you know, the real nitty gritty, and we should have that, of course, but there is a tremendous value for the "This Week In Petroleum," and the Country Analysis Briefs and things like that.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Are there any other comments?  
\par \tab \tab Calvin?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Well, let Mary go first.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Oh, I'm sorry, Mary.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: She's got her hand up.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: This discussion has answered some of the questions that Cal brought up, I just wanted to answer a few more of them.
\par \tab \tab Since you've left EIA you've gotten much better in terms of quick turnaround analysis.  We can quickly answer congressional questions now with quality work, without having to go through all our different steps of various category one review.  We still do that for major large reports, but in answering simple analytical questions based on prior work we do that very quickly now, and I think with very high quality.
\par \tab \tab As already mentioned, the ESAR does integrate lots of other work that's being done in EIA, and a lot of our constituents cannot find that other work easily on a web site.  We talked about this issue last night at dinner with the navigation issues related to our web site.  So, bringing all of this information together, and having it on our home page, so they can just click on it and find the ESAR very quickly, helps our clientele find the information.
\par \tab \tab We've also let policymakers know that we're doing it without doing the LISTSERV.  We felt we'd start the LISTSERV up once things got to the point where this information needed to go to them and be on their desk that day, but if we just inform them that we were doing it then they would be able to access it whenever they wanted to.
\par \tab \tab Since you were at EIA, things have gotten very volatile in other markets.  The natural gas market has gotten very volatile with prices, the California situation, and also electricity markets have gotten pretty volatile, too.
\par \tab \tab We've also seen natural gas prices go up when oil prices have gone up, too, and policymakers today want to track all these fuels because they are looked at in a different light today in the different markets, and they want to know very quickly what the data are.
\par \tab \tab We have weeklies in coal that we collect EIA data on.  We have weeklies in petroleum, and starting in May with the Underground Natural Gas Storage Survey we will be collecting data in natural gas.  So, in three of the four areas we will have our weekly data ourselves.
\par \tab \tab Leaving out something like electricity, because we don't have weekly data, seemed not to be appropriate to the issues that policymakers wanted to look at it, what are the volatilities in these markets, how do the prices change, what are the impacts based on various issues, including weather and others?
\par \tab \tab Lowell didn't put in his report web statistics, but we have checked on the web hits because we were thinking about how long do we continue this, and the web hits, even though they are not at the top, are still very high to warrant it to be continued at this point in time, probably because it's an integrated information of all our fuel areas.
\par \tab \tab I stepped out, Cal, so I didn't hear all the things that you mentioned, and I may not be addressing a lot of the other things that you had brought up, but that's a summary of some of the things that we did.
\par \tab \tab Oh, we picked twice a week, Jim, because that was how frequently we could get updated data, and it didn't make sense to do anymore than twice a week.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Calvin?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Just a couple of final comments.
\par \tab \tab I don't think that what I said should have been interpreted as being a negative.  It's just that I think that my impression from having read it is, is that it is addressed here, if EIA is going to make the decision to have a twice a week publication that they need to make that as a conscious decision and treat it like any other publication that they put out, whether it's a weekly or not.  It's no longer a crisis report, and I think that fundamentally changes the nature of it.
\par \tab \tab I still think that you need to ask yourself, who is this going to serve, and if so make it part of your culture, rather than saying, well, this is when the world goes bad we are going to put this out.  And, that's all I'm saying, I'm not being critical of the document itself, because I've obviously found it very useful, and I think there's a lot of other people that have found it very useful.  If it's incorporating your other weeklies that you are putting out, you may want to take a look at how those relate and do you need to put out all of these weeklies, or does this need to be tied to like the Monthly Energy Review, but it's the Weekly Energy Review, because I think the Monthly Energy Review is still our most popular publication.  It's certainly the one that I think most people in the industry wait with baited breath for to come out. 
\par \tab \tab And so, these are the sorts of things that I am saying is that it seems to me that it has morphed and I think you need to put the form on that morph, but I'm not being critical of the document.  Obviously, I found it useful.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Are there any other questions or comments?
\par \tab \tab Okay, then, thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab MR. FELD: Okay, thank you.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Our next presentation is a briefing on information quality guidelines by Nancy Kirkendall and Jay Casselberry.
\par \tab \tab I hate that paper clip guy.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: He's irritating.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Completely.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Well, Jay and I are going to talk to you about Priority 10 for EIA, the Information Quality Guidelines.  These are new guidelines by the Office of Management and Budget.  They apply to all departments and agencies, not just statistical agencies, and Jay and I are teaming up on, well, the whole activity, as well as this presentation.
\par \tab \tab I'll talk about what's going on with OMB, the Department of Energy, and then the statistical agencies, and Jay is going to talk about what's going on within EIA.
\par \tab \tab At the fall meeting, we did talk to you about this activity.  In September, September 28}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super th}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 , OMB issued their Quality Guidelines.  We told you that the statistical agencies had formed a team so that we could address issues, since statistical agencies are more like each other than they are like anybody else we thought it would be a good idea to coordinate this activity.  We formed a committee within EIA and, basically, work has begun.
\par \tab \tab So, now it's six months later, OMB reissued the guidelines.  They added a need for an appeal process.  The original guidelines said that every agency had to establish an administrative procedure so that the public could complain about data quality.
\par \tab \tab In the guidelines that came out in January, they said not only can they complain but if they don't like what you said they have to have the right to complain again.  So, that was a new wrinkle on it.  And then, they also gave more information about what they meant by reproducibility.
\par \tab \tab So, since that time the statistical agencies have drafted a Federal Register notice, it's  public information about quality.  It's kind of a principles and practices for statistical agencies. It also lists seven or eight basic activities that most of us engage in, and so the way we are getting some commonality in that is that agencies that have specific standards are organizing their standards around those areas.
\par \tab \tab Within EIA, they've been }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  Jay's group has been working on guidelines and they've drafted 11 new standards.  As you know, we have statistical standards in place, they haven't been refreshed for some time, and so we thought this was a fine opportunity to take a fresh look at them and revise them.
\par \tab \tab In fact, the OMB guidelines asked that agencies get outside groups to comment on their information quality guidelines, so you are our guinea pigs, a perfect group to ask for input on our quality guidelines.  So, I'd encourage you to think about, you know, anything that you have, suggestions you have to improve what we are up to.  We are going to have to keep }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  you know, this is an evolving project, and it's going to be evolving.  The next }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  well, we need to have our guidelines up on our web site by May 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .  We need to have a package to OMB saying what our guidelines are by July 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 , and then we have to have the "final guidelines" up on our web site on October 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .  That doesn't mean they won't change, you know this going to be an evolving process as we figure out what works and what doesn't work.
\par \tab \tab The last question has to do with reproducibility.  This is a new thing that came in the guidelines, and I'll talk about that a little later.
\par \tab \tab So, this is sort of a quote from the quality guidelines.  In fact, I think the title of the OMB's Quality Guidelines are "Guidelines to Ensure and Maximize the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies."  And, every agency is supposed to have guidelines.  They talk about the review process, and they talk about having a process for the public to complain.
\par \tab \tab As a little background, the OMB guidelines came about as part of the OMB appropriation from Congress, they told OMB they were going to have to do this, and that came about because EPA put out a rulemaking, a proposal for rulemaking, based on a study that was not of high quality and the data were not available to the public for analysis.  And so, they took this problem and kind of hit it with a hammer, I think.
\par \tab \tab So, the concepts of quality are on this slide. These are all carefully described in the OMB guidelines, and the first one, the utility, objectivity, integrity, have been in the guidelines from the beginning.  In the new ones, the requirements are more clear about this influential transparent reproducible, and what they'll say is that agencies are supposed to designate what information they have that's influential, and for that information they have to assure transparency, which I think is documentation, you document your data and your methods, and reproducibility.  They do allow you }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  they give kind of a definition of what they mean by reproducibility, but they allow you to define it yourself, too.
\par \tab \tab So, my point of view for statistical agencies is, since we are not }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I think it's the use of the data that makes it influential, and we aren't the primary users of our data.  I mean, you could certainly say that some data are influential.  The possible problem is that you can put data out there, you don't think it's influential, but some time later somebody will pick it up and use it for something and it becomes influential.
\par \tab \tab And so, I think statistical agencies have always had good practices that try to assure transparency.  Our current standards require documentation of methods and data sources.  We assure reproducibility by archiving data and computer code.  If we follow our standards and our good practice guidelines then we should have transparency reproducibility, and my view is that means we don't need to define what's influential.  And so, we'll see how well that flies.
\par \tab \tab I gave a talk yesterday to the National Academy of Sciences as part of a workshop sponsored by the Office of Management and Budget, so at least the ideas are out there.
\par \tab \tab I've already covered the first point.
\par \tab \tab OMB finally, after the first of the year, OMB realized that the departments were not doing very much.  Statistical agencies got a head start, we started working back in September, but departments weren't paying very much attention to it.  So, they started }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  OMB started establishing working groups to talk about different issues, so they have interagency groups looking at, for example, the administrative process.  That's mostly lawyers from the departments who are trying to figure out how they ought to institute this administrative process for complaints.
\par \tab \tab They have groups that are looking at risk assessment and other topics. They've had a group that talked about this influential reproducibility transparency.  
\par \tab \tab They also started the National Academy of Sciences workshops, which were conveniently held yesterday and today.  Jay managed to go yesterday, so at least we have some idea of what was going on at that workshop.  We are missing this morning.
\par \tab \tab The Department of Energy is finally also getting started.  I think they only started about a month ago, you know, finally when they started hearing that OMB was serious they decided maybe they needed to be serious, too.
\par \tab \tab Jay and I are working on the team within the department.  In fact, the team consists of five people, so we are a fairly healthy part of the team.  There are two members from the General Counsel's office and one from the CIO office who has the lead on the whole project.
\par \tab \tab Mary, have you received a letter asking for information about the Quality Guidelines?
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: No.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: In theory, there's one that's coming out soon, maybe it's coming out Monday, to all heads of departmental elements asking for a point of contact and for information about how they assure quality.  But, the department is supposed to have something up on their web site by May 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 , so this is going to certainly be quick.
\par \tab \tab And then, the statistical team, we have 14 agencies participating.  We hope that all of them will end up signing the }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Federal Register}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  notice we've been preparing.  Basically, the }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Federal Register}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  notice is just a statement of principles and practices. We are using it to announce the web sites for the statistical agencies, where they can find the Quality Guidelines.
\par \tab \tab We are working with it, it's kind of changing as we try to work it through departments, because to have something signed by all 14 agencies means it has to be approved by the General Counsel's office within each of the departments that are involved, so that's kind of an interesting exercise.
\par \tab \tab One of the big advantages of the groups is that as we've developed our approaches to the Quality Guidelines we've shared them with each other, and so we are ending up stealing good ideas from each other, and this is also going to help us look more similar, because we are all kind of moving in the same direction together.
\par \tab \tab And now I'll give it to Jay to tell you about EIA's approach.
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: For our approach for the guidelines, what we've decided to do is pretty much we are just bringing together all of the information that we've done over time in guidelines.  We've always had standards, we've had the different types of reviews of products to make sure they were of high quality before we go out.  We have procedures for the integrity of our computer systems, to make sure that people can't go on to our web site and change information.
\par \tab \tab We are trying to bring all that together and discuss it and put it out in a document that explains to the public all the different things we do.  We are also looking at our existing standards that were created back in the late 1980s, to update those.  They were developed especially in the dissemination area for printed products, where you had issues of products, and now with the web site it's a lot easier to change information.  There's not quite one product that has the explanatory notes and all the information about the data. It's not always quite as related as when you put out a single publication.
\par \tab \tab We want to explain a little bit better the review process we do.  We've always had internal paperwork on the different types of review and when they were applicable.  We want to be able to put that out so people understand that we do, for ongoing publications we have one type of review, for extremely important products, or one-time products, we have a category one review across the agency, and we also bring in independent expert reviewers to look at products that we think need that kind of review.
\par \tab \tab We've also, we're developing the public mechanism, and this will probably be a Department of Energy type mechanism, where people can complain to EIA that we didn't follow our Quality Guidelines.  They can suggest data where we didn't adhere to it, and ask us to correct it, and then we have to have a process where we'll look at their complaints and respond back to them, and if they don't agree with our response then they will be able to go to someplace else within either EIA, the Department of Energy, to request an appeal of how we handled it, and then we'll be reporting all that information to OMB at different points, all the federal agencies will be doing that.
\par \tab \tab And so, we'll have the Quality Guidelines web site that will have the discussion of what we do in quality and also have that mechanism for people to complain.
\par \tab \tab With our standards, we have 30 proposed standards that are going to replace the existing ones.  We've already put out for review within EIA the first 11, which talk about interagency requirements, the Office of Management and Budget has requirements for agencies on things like how they handle race and ethnicity, and standard metropolitan statistical areas.  We have systems for our documentation of the systems, and for development of them, and then we've handled the ones for collection and processing, what we expect with regard to the quality procedures for the collection and processing of information, and the next steps will be to get into what we do with regard to dissemination for the models and for the complaint process.
\par \tab \tab We are also }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  we are working on the Quality Standards, we also have other standards within EIA that have been worked on by other groups.  There's the Information Technology Group, which is developing standards for our systems, and they tie into quality because they start to tie into the integrity aspect, so the information can't be changed or people can't get access to the information and change it, what's available to the public.  So, the Information Technology ones we are tying in.
\par \tab \tab Our Information Products and Service Committee puts out standards for our web products, and that deals with the usability and the documentation of information that's out on our web site, and our Customer Service Committee to make sure that we have the complaint process and how we deal with comments coming in from the public.
\par \tab \tab And, once we complete all the standards, we are completing them in conjunction with the guidelines, and they'll all be available on our web site by October 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 , when we put out the new Quality Guidelines.
\par \tab \tab We did provide you with a copy of our new Quality Guidelines web site, and what it does is, it takes the OMB guidelines and it talks about the different concepts that Nancy was talking about.  It talks about what we do with regard to utility or usefulness of the data, how we talk to both data users and we talk to the respondents, the data providers, to try and get at the usability issues.  We use the }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Federal Register}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  to get comments.  We do cognitive interviews.  We do a lot of different ways, we go to meetings, industry meetings.  We do a lot of different things to try and get at the usability issue.
\par \tab \tab With the objectivity issue, we get at that in two ways.  One is in the different things we do to try and improve the data collection and processing processes, but then also when we put out data to try and make sure that we give good explanatory notes.  We try and explain to people how we collected the data, what the sources were, what the methods we used were.  If we think there are any limitations in the data, to try and make that explicit so people know where there might be questions about data, or where they can at least assess it and use their own judgment as to whether or not it's appropriate for their needs.
\par \tab \tab And, with the integrity, that gets a lot more into the information technology area, and just protecting information as it goes through our processing, and collection, and dissemination steps, to make sure that it can't be falsified.
\par \tab \tab We are developing the new standards.  As Nancy mentioned, we are coming out with the statistical agency }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Federal Register}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  notice, and we will have a complaint process.
\par \tab \tab The milestones that Nancy mentioned is, by May 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  all the federal agencies will have out their Quality Guidelines for the public to comment on.  We have to address those comments and then by July 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  we have to get to OMB what we are proposing as our draft EIA Quality Guidelines.  They will come back to us some time between July 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and October 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  with their comments, and then we will finalize our Quality Guidelines and have them up on our web site and we'll be working under them October 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .  And, that also opens up the complaint process where the public can then start complaining to different agencies about their information.
\par \tab \tab One interesting thing in the OMB guidelines, it does allow for people to complain about any information the agency is disseminating, so it doesn't apply to just information that was disseminated after October 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 .  People can actually come in and complain about information that was disseminated, for example, information on our web site that's still out there after October 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  people could come in and complain about that.
\par \tab \tab By January 1}{\expnd0\expndtw-3\super st}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  of 2004, all the agencies are going to be reporting to OMB on the types of complaints they received from the public about adherence to the Quality Guidelines and how they dealt with them, and we'll have to do that annually and then OMB is going to probably report that information back to Congress.
\par \tab \tab We were looking for any suggestions you have with regard to our Quality Guidelines.  The OMB guidelines do make it clear that it's any information that's disseminated by a federal agency, so really any information an agency puts out sort of becomes that agency's quality guidelines.  So, for example, when we put out our International Energy Annual we put out information that we get from a lot of different country statistical agencies.  We do try and make it clear that it wasn't collected by EIA, that we are just reporting what they provided to us.  It does have transparency, it does have reproducibility, but it doesn't adhere to the same qualities as you would expect from information collected in the process by EIA.  That's going to apply to all agencies.
\par \tab \tab There's also the reproducibility aspect, and for analytical products, where you have people knowledgeable about program areas, where they are sitting down with the data and making assumptions, two people can look at the same data and come up with different results, the reproducibility of that is a question.
\par \tab \tab That's it.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Are there any questions or comments from the Committee, any ideas on their questions?
\par \tab \tab Jim?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: I think overall you and all the other statistical agencies have done a very good job.  Data quality has always been a central issue here, much better shape than many other agencies in responding to this.
\par \tab \tab On the point about analytical products, you know, of course there are data analysis, there's some modeling study, we all know you can make different assumptions to fit different models or whatever, and that's an old and standard problem in the field, and I think all that can really be done is document what you did, what choices you made. And, typically, in the products I've seen that's very well done.
\par \tab \tab It's sort of nice when you put out your own report, you are not limited by the external page constraints, so you do have the space to document all this stuff, and, basically, I think you guys are in really good shape.
\par \tab \tab Let me ask, on the influential aspect, if I understood these requirements apply to influential information.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: They tell you that your influential information should be held to a higher standard, which makes some sense.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: And, are you taking the position that everything you do is influential because you can't predict it?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: No, I'm taking a position that I don't need to worry about influential because I make sure that everything }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  you know, we need to follow our good practices, of course, but if we do that then everything is reproducible and transparent, and that would mean I don't need to worry about influential, because }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: So, you'll activate all that is influential?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Yeah, I mean, because you would do that anyway if you followed our standards.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: Right.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Calvin?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Do you have some early thoughts as to how your old standards are going to change?  Do you have any particular data quality problems that are issues right now that you need to resolve, because after this presentation you've obviously got a great process there for complying, and I just wonder if you know of }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  it's been ten years since you've done a revision, what are your issues?  What are your problems?  What is the public saying, gee, that needs to be corrected?
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: Well, I think we've done the collection and processing, and we really did not make very }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  we made very few changes in those standards, because there's not really very much change in that except for the electronic collection of information, and that really doesn't }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  isn't affected by the standards.
\par \tab \tab I think with the dissemination, which we've just started into, I think that gets into more problems, simply because of the issue I mentioned with the web products, and that's the making sure that people have access to that information, sort of the transparency aspect, they have access to where the sources of the data were and the methods were, because with the web so many tables and things, they look separate, and usually they aren't }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  sometimes they aren't as well linked to descriptions of the methods and sources of how the data was derived.  And, I think that's what we are trying to address right now.  That's what our committee is discussing.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: So, it's basically a linking.
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: Yeah, making sure that information is available.
\par \tab \tab I don't really think we have problems in the quality area, we don't really have major problems that we are trying to address, I think it's just a matter of trying to make sure that the information that we have is available.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Well, there's not a big hue and outcry out there saying }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  let's take one from ten years ago, your net imports figure is bunk, or something like that, you are not hearing those sorts of things?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Not all of our }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I mean, you've heard about the quality initiatives in natural gas and electric power.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Yes.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: So, everything is not wonderful, and we need to work on them, but I don't think that that is going to cause changes to the standards.  So, the standard }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  actually, you do have a new standard, though, that asks you to go through more quality steps.  I think that's one that you have already talked about, one that's a little bit different from any of the old ones.
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: Well, we have the data evaluation one, which, yes }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Data evaluation one.
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY:  }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  it talks more about the different things that can be done for data evaluation, and that is a new one, but what it does is, it is general insomuch as we aren't requiring a lot of the things to be done, we are just suggesting different things that you can do for data evaluation and suggesting that they should do those kind of things. And, if they do them, then they should explain that to the reader so they can better understand the limitations of the data if they identify them.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Neha, did you have a comment on this discussion, or were you going to change the subject?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KHANNA: Well, sort of slightly, yes.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Okay.
\par \tab \tab Mary?
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Actually, Cal, I think your questions are very good.  Obviously, we do have quality issues that people are bringing to our attention.
\par \tab \tab I think that maybe we should look at seeing whether we can link it to the standards more.  I think the major issue is compliance with the standards, and having some sort of better review process to ensure compliance, number one.
\par \tab \tab We've been working in other areas, too, dealing with quality, such as doing layered performance measures, so that it can get up to a higher level, and, perhaps, we need to look at standards for something like that so that we can link the standards and quality better.
\par \tab \tab If this group has any suggestions on that, I think that would be helpful to us.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Okay.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KHANNA: I had a question on the international side, where you don't specifically collect your own data, these are data that are reported to you.  Now, when it comes to some countries, especially developing countries, there's a huge question about the quality and the reliability of the data that you receive.  Is there any effort at all to communicate that, or to double check that, or to over time maybe at least find out anything about, you know, whether those data are improving?  Can I believe those data?
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: I don't work in the international area, I can't really speak to that too well.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: I think they try to say what they do to assure quality, but there's not a whole lot you can do when you are collecting it from other countries.  You know, we can't require other countries to report to us.  We can't require that they adhere to particular quality standards.
\par \tab \tab But, the fact that we collect the information, we put it all together in one place for people to use, is a service, and about all we can do is to describe the limitations of the data, the steps we try to take, you know.  The international people do take some efforts to make sure they get good numbers, but there's no guarantees.  You know, there's just too much that can go on in other countries that we have no control over, and possibly no knowledge of.
\par \tab \tab So, as long as we document what it is we do, and what we think the limitations of the data are, then I think we are okay.  That's the transparency part of it, as long as we are clear in what we know and what we don't know.  
\par \tab \tab People can use that information if they decide how to use it.
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: At yesterday's meeting at the National Academy of Sciences, the influential is very controversial, because a lot of agencies do use it, not EIA, but a lot of other agencies do use outside data sources, especially when they are coming up with rules and regulations, and EPA is probably a good example of that.
\par \tab \tab And, once an agency uses information from other sources to come up with to develop regulations or rulemaking, things that affect industry, then it does become the influential, and there are a lot of public interest groups and industry groups that want to look at the transparency and the reproducibility of the findings that have come out, and ensure they are of appropriate quality that the agency should use it, because once they use it for their rulemaking or regulatory purposes, then it becomes agency information almost, and then the agency has a responsibility to ensure the quality of it before it uses it.
\par \tab \tab So, I think that there's a transparency aspect that I think also a lot of industry, and some public interest groups, are really going to start looking at the reproducibility and things like that.  Do you know, is there enough information about the assumptions, and what the core data was.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Especially the data used in rulemaking is going to end up being scrutinized very carefully, and, of course, they are afraid that's what going to happen is, you'll never get any regulations approved, because of all the scrutiny.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Nicolas?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HENGARTNER: Talking about transparency, I was just thinking about the emergency reports we are talking about, will you try to actually give a hint of how precise or how reliable you think the data is going to be?  For example, yellow, red, or green, I mean, hopefully, not red, but it sounds funny, but we get the data, and you are going to put data together from different places, with different reliability, it makes sense to somehow at least for transparency purposes to give us an education how reliable you think the data is.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Well, for statistical information, we've published standard errors or at least revisions over time, when you can think that the last publication is the most accurate, gives you an idea of the relationship between timeliness and accuracy.
\par \tab \tab In terms of the international data, I'm not quite sure how you do that, because it's kind of hard to come up with a judgment.  I'm sure that the people who do that report would be able to }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  they may not want to publish it, but they have a feel for which numbers are probably better than other numbers, or more reliable, but I'm not sure they'd be willing to put red, yellow, green on it.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Johnny?
\par \tab \tab MR. BLAIR: Yes, just kind of a follow-up in terms of the international data.
\par \tab \tab My experience always has been that whatever statements you make about limitations and standard errors and so forth, once you put data out it's data, that, you know, people take it as this is now the truth and are going to use it regardless of what caveats come along with it.
\par \tab \tab My question is, does }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  mainly, I guess, in the international area }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  do the people who put together these data ever find that something needs such a red flag that it really shouldn't be disseminated or shouldn't be published?  There are certain points that you don't go beyond as far as, you know, what you will pass on, are there any guidelines or standards for deciding, you know, this is beyond the pale for whatever reason?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: There are no guidelines or standards for that sort of thing on an EIA-wide level.  I don't know what the program office does.  They probably do some sort of filter on it, you know, because they don't want to put out something they think is misleading or wrong.  But, I don't know that the details of what they do within the office that assembles the information.
\par \tab \tab MR. BLAIR: But, do you know whether, just sort of a kind of }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  are there sometimes, as far as you know, things that are not passed on or not disseminated, is there any sense that everything goes through, or is it that some things get stopped?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: I really don't know.  My guess is that there are things that get stopped.  I mean, you know, those folks make a lot of phone calls to try to get information.  They get information from as many sources as they can, and getting the information itself is a little challenging.
\par \tab \tab So, I wouldn't be surprised if they come up with some information that they don't use because they don't think that it makes any sense, but I really don't have personal knowledge, but, you know, just saying that I can see that that would be how they might operate.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: So, have you ever gotten comments back from your public calling into questions some of the values or, you know, people that work with your data a lot, thinking, you know, well, I've worked with this data and I've been working with this data for ten years, and now I've got this new set of data and it looks funny to me, or I'm suspicious about this one value?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Mary?
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: We definitely do.  When we have that we take another look at the data and see if there's a problem with it, reissue it if there is.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: EIA has always worked with customers and users.  We have, our National Energy Information Center fields phone calls and they sometimes are asking for information and sometimes they want to complain about something.
\par \tab \tab They pass comments to the program office, and people try to react to them.  This appeal process is sort of another layer on that, if somebody is really annoyed now they have another vehicle to complain.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Well, you asked about, you know, what our thoughts were on how to ensure reproducibility of analytical products, and I think that EIA is to be commended for the amount of data that they make available to the public, because this is becoming really one of my pet peeves in public health, because the data confidentiality, people don't release their data.  So, they'll publish, like they'll develop a new statistical method, and they'll use their data set to illustrate that, and then you contact the authors for the data, so that you are supposed to be able to reproduce this new method that they've invented, and you can't because they won't give you the data.
\par \tab \tab And so, I think that, you know, you are going to go a long way in circumventing all those problems, simply because you make so much of your data available to the public.
\par \tab \tab Jim?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: This is just an observation or question, maybe you've already thought about, on the tradeoff with our influential versus the quality, presumably, EIA should use a different }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and the question is, what data are so poor they shouldn't be reported, EIA should err more on the side of putting stuff out and use transparency as its defense, whereas, a regulatory agency like EPA would then have to make an independent determination whether those data are appropriate for basing a rule on.
\par \tab \tab And so, I wouldn't, you know, I think you are thinking this way already, but I just want to say we should be careful not to let these rules lead to less production and less release of data from the statistical agencies.
\par \tab \tab Was there anything that came up at the NAS workshop that sort of was new to you or caused you }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: That's your question, because you were actually there.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT:  }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  to look at things differently than you had been planning?
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: I think a lot of it had to do with data from secondary sources, and they talked about EPA has a toxic inventory, some of that, and I think someone from the National Resources Defense Council, although it wasn't from secondary sources, but they mentioned even our Greenhouse Gases Survey collection, which is based on voluntary reporting and are people using their estimation methods that they've come up with.
\par \tab \tab And so, I think it just seemed like there was a real tradeoff.  I think the people from the public interest groups were worried that this was going to be used by industry, and maybe business groups, to sort of get agencies or to be able to stop things where they can come in and start questioning the data and use that as another method.  
\par \tab \tab And, I think the people, the lawyers, then they get into the notice of proposed rulemaking, a lot of the regulatory aspects, where they feel like the people already have the ability to question data that is used in the rulemaking, and so this won't cause the major problems, and I think right now it's just a lot of people are sort of uncertain.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: There are a lot of agencies that are going to have to define what is influential, and I'm hoping we can avoid it, but at least a specific definition.  As long as we can assure transparency and reproducibility, then if something becomes influential then we are okay.
\par \tab \tab But, there was a talk by somebody from the Food and Drug Administration, there are a lot of agencies that }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  OMB has a definition of }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  not influential, what's the word }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  economic }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 
\par \tab \tab MR. CASSELBERRY: For major rules they have a certain cutoff.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL:  }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  they have a cutoff, and it's based on a dollar estimate.  And so, they are all thinking that that would be an easy definition to adopt, because it's already out there and just if you are going to make a cut, why not use the cuts that have already been made.  It's supposed to have substantial impact, I think that's it.
\par \tab \tab So, you know, there are a lot of differences from one agency to another, which is one reason why it's nice to work with a statistical agency, so we at least have the same concerns.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Are there any other questions or comments?
\par \tab \tab Okay, thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab Just one thing, if you were not here this morning or yesterday, could you please step to the microphone and introduce yourself?  Everybody else was here.
\par \tab \tab Okay, great, Mary, you had a question?
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Yes.
\par \tab \tab Since we have some extra time before we are to break, this last conversation brought up some issues that I think would be useful to get your input on.
\par \tab \tab One deals with how do you monitor compliance, and the other deals with quality of international data.  Let's take the one on monitoring compliance first.
\par \tab \tab We used to have a very organized procedure to do that, where the predecessor organization to the one that Nancy now is in charge of did data quality audits on systems and determined what the problems might be on data systems and quality of data.  And then, the program office needed to respond to that and indicate how they were going to fix the problem.
\par \tab \tab We've stopped doing that, about eight, tens year ago, something like that?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Not that long ago, I think it was }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I don't remember when it was, it was certainly when Linda came in.  I don't know whether we were still doing }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I think we were still doing audits before that.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Okay.  Maybe it was about six years ago.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: We were still doing them in the early `90s.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Okay.
\par \tab \tab So, now the issue is, we've stopped doing that.  I don't think we are totally adhering to the standards, and we certainly lack the resources to do these audit checks that we used to do, both because our contracts budget has gone down, and the other is because our standing is going down. 
\par \tab \tab And, Nancy has now tried to figure out ways that we should be monitoring compliance again, and we've had some ideas thrown out but we haven't totally figured out how to do it.
\par \tab \tab And, maybe Nancy can talk about some of the ideas that have come about, and maybe we could get your input as to what you think about these ideas, or possibly give us other ideas.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Well, some of the }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  well, Jay told you that we have some new standards in the IT area, and one of them has to do with the development of systems, including systems for survey processing.  And, they really count, so that's a new standard that really concentrates on how you go about developing a new system that gets you the collaboration and the proper specifications and goes through testing. 
\par \tab \tab And, if you go through the process, you also end up with documentation.  You can get a user's manual and a program reference guide.  And so, it's a nice idea, you follow the process, you end up with two documents that you really ought to have, one that tell users how to use the system, and the other one that tells the programmer how to maintain the system.
\par \tab \tab In the past, the audits }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  well, in the past our standard asked for survey documentation, so that included, not only the documentation of the computer system, but also the manual steps that you go through to process the survey.  So, Jay's group is going to pick up and write another standard to cover the missing pieces of documenting the survey flow.
\par \tab \tab But, what we used to do to audit the system was, basically, to use checklists. Does the documentation have all the appropriate headings?  We didn't make sure that somebody could pick up and use the system, for example.  And so, that doesn't seem like there was a lot of value added, because we have, you know, if you can't pick up the documentation and use it for its intended purpose then why do you have it in the first place.
\par \tab \tab So, one of the thoughts was that for a user's guide you can just do some usability testing within the organizations, get a little team, do some usability testing, can somebody actually use the documentation to run the system.  And, if they can then the documentation must be adequate.
\par \tab \tab So, that would be something that we could do that }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  in other words, it would be using the audit to make sure that the purpose of the documentation is satisfied.
\par \tab \tab Otherwise, we haven't gotten too far in thinking about how we would be doing auditing or checking against the standards.  I guess we figured we'd get the standards first and we'd worry about auditing later, but we know that it's something coming, we are going to have to address it at some point.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR PHIPPS: Does IT have its own kind of internal processes, like they have the users do the acceptance testing for all the }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  you know, before it even gets to the end point, to make sure there's not errors?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: I don't think }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  well, the process has been pared down from a process that the department has been promulgating, and we haven't actually used the process yet.  So, we have two issues, one of them is how do we get the appropriate documentation for current systems, and then the other one is, how well does that process work and does it actually result in the things that we need.
\par \tab \tab So, user testing, I don't know that }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I mean, that's been a historic problem with EIA systems development.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR PHIPPS: Usually you'd have some people, the survey program people, who are going to }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  or whoever was going to use it, do acceptance testing as they build the system, and then that }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and then you would need it to check the documentation, too.  But, you could avoid problems in the early stages.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Since Cals here, maybe we could hear about what you thought about our old way of checking with compliance when they used to check, they did the audits on the systems, and provided to the administrator what the issues were, do you remember that?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Oh, there are some things you don't forget.  I would step back from that and say that I think that when I came in there was a change in the culture taking place regarding data quality, and I think that the process that was developed, you said these evolved over 1988 to 1992, which obviously encompassed, you know, most of the time that I was there.  I thought it worked very well, but I do remember the program offices had a great deal of resistance, particularly, to the documentation.  I mean, that was the place where we just didn't get the documentation accomplished that needed to be done.
\par \tab \tab And, I'm assuming that that problem has gone away and everybody happily documents it.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Absolutely not.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: But, that was a huge issue that we had, that OMB had with us, and other agencies had with us, was the documentation, and I know originally when we were doing NEMS the problems of the documentation that were associated with the NEMS project and everything, but I think that the loop has to go back to the administrator, and I thought that the system worked very well, because that certainly then communicated if it came from the administrator back to the program office that there was a much higher level of importance, and you better get it done, and I'm going to be checking up on you to make sure that it got done, rather than having a colleague-type office and so forth that was doing it.  So, I really thought that the audit system, as it was developing, and as it was when I left, was really working pretty well.
\par \tab \tab You know, I was pleased with that, and I really think that the culture changed, because it was pretty much prior to my coming, well, everybody is doing their own thing, and we are responsible as the program office for our own quality.  And, we even had the great data definitions disputes, you know, where we were having program offices using different data definitions for the same product, and it just does not appear that those sorts of things are the issues that they once were, and that may just be because I'm not on the inside anymore.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: Well, the data definitions team just finished its work last year, and they actually }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  where there were multiple definitions within EIA they got them to agree.  I mean, they really did amazing work, it took them three years for the team to finish it, but I think there's some very good acceptance of that result.
\par \tab \tab So, that's a lot more collaboration than we used to have, but that could be done }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  yeah, you are right, in your day nobody would have given up their own definition.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: No.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: But, I mean, they used to say in the program office, I know one program office at least that said, well, you need these three different kinds of documents.  So, they'd take the same thing and they'd xerox it, so you'd have three books with a different heading on it.
\par \tab \tab So then they could say, oh, well, you know, we comply, we have this book.  So, you know, so I don't like the old way, but I don't know what the new way is, so it's something we are going to work on.  I think there does need to be some compliance, people need to have somebody to look over their shoulder.  I think even the program offices would appreciate it if somebody would make sure that a user could use their user's guide.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Well again, there's a historical element to it, because when I came in we still had a lot of people left when the various program offices had been part of the previous federal agency before DOE had been created, and they brought with them the definitions, and the processes, and so forth, from that background.  And so, it was really creating an EIA culture, I think, on this, which, again, appears to me to have happened, because I remember, and again having doing what I'm doing with the history of EIA, we are not spending as much time on data quality as we were certainly at the beginning  of what this committee did, used to spend an inordinate amount of time.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KIRKENDALL: On data quality?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: On data quality.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Did you want to revisit the international question?
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Yes.  Since that topic has dried up, we'll go on to another one.
\par \tab \tab This deals with international statistics, and, in particular, China.  I believe in yesterday's }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Washington Post}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 , or I think somebody told me it was the }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Post}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 , but I didn't get a chance to read it yet, there was an article about government being duped in taking on China's statistics and believing them.  And, in fact, that we should not do that.  The issue here is, we do put out an International Energy Annual report.  We do report statistics for China.  The question is, where do you get data from China if you don't use their statistics?  I believe the 1999 data that they submitted showed their coal consumption to have dropped dramatically and moved into gas, and people were questioning whether that's accurate.  The other issue is with their GDP growth rate, people don't believe the high numbers that they are seeing.
\par \tab \tab The International Energy Agency was supposed to send out a team to China to look into this, and I don't know how far they've gotten.  I don't know if you know, Guy, but I guess I'd like to hear from you, what do you think about the issue of statistics from countries and what do you think we should do about it?
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Neha, did you have a comment?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KHANNA: Well, I did, especially with regards to China, because I looked at the ACDA, the Arms Control and something Agency, just as the World Military Expenditures in Arms Transfers report, they have GNP data that countries compare those, I compared those to the World Bank's data, and especially for China they are dramatically different, and China is just one example, but developing countries in general, there is an order of magnitude difference between what the ACDA reports and what the World Bank reports, }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  econometrics process, you know, where do you get your data from, because I haven't checked the groceries, but, you know, just actual levels there's huge differences, and that's something }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I mean, they are getting their data from somewhere, I don't know what their sources are.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: I didn't hear the source, could you repeat it?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KHANNA: It's the Arms Control Disarmament Agency, and their report is the World Military Expenditure in Arms Transfers, and it comes out every year, and it's available on their web site.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Calvin?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Well, I've got a couple of comments.  We have some very close connections with the University of China, in fact, I spend a month in China every year, and I also have a consultant contract with Sinopet, which is their big monopoly, and I always remember one of the first conversations I had with them on statistics, because I had a whole bunch of their statistics, and I came in and I said, you know, it's impossible for this output that they had listed on the production, I think it was natural gas liquids or something.
\par \tab \tab COURT REPORTER: Excuse me, could you speak up a little bit.  I'm having trouble hearing.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Oh, whatever it was, and I'm not sure I was that on the record, but }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and I said, well, where do the statistics }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and they said, well, this was what was in the plan and we always achieve the plan.  I mean, that was the answer that we got, where did this statistic come from, well, it was in the plan, and we always achieve the plan.
\par \tab \tab And so, I do think that you have to look with a high level of skepticism at those figures, and I think that for many of those figures what you actually have to do is, if you can get them, and that often involves having somebody who can read Mandarin, you know, to be able to look at the base data that's being turned in before it gets processed for release, because then that will tell you a different story.
\par \tab \tab I think that you would need to have }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  take it with a high degree of suspicion, except it's an incredible amount of growth that's taking place there.  But, if coal consumption is dropping dramatically, you certainly don't see it as you travel around the country.  I mean, I don't think it's possible, I can't conceive that it is possible, having the growth rate that they have, the decline in coal usage, their claimed increase in electric output, and you can't see where it's coming from.  I mean, it's impossible for those three things to be reconciled.  I'll just state that.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Guy, did you have something to add?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR CARUSO: The more general question about international energy statistics that none of us have raised, there was an attempt to address that about a year or so ago, when Secretary Richardson was still here, and it had to do with the transparency of oil data mainly.  So, the IEA took the lead with DIA being a strong supporter to form a group which includes the U.N. statistical agency, the APEC, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Statistical Group, the OLADE, Latin American statistical group, they formed this working group which has now met several times, and the international part of EIA is involved in that.  And, they are coming out with a report on the quality of the international energy statistics which is going to be delivered to energy ministers in Osaka in October of this year.  So, there's an attempt to move in a direction of better data quality.  I don't think it's ever going to reach the standards that would make Nancy happy, and, in particular, countries like China, but more importantly in the oil field, oil producers are very reluctant to put out accurate information when it politically doesn't serve their purposes.
\par \tab \tab So, we've got a problem here that I don't think is ever going to be ASA-approved, but nevertheless there is some action going on, and including the training of some Chinese statisticians at the IEA.  They've had two groups come to the IEA, spend a month there, go back to China, mainly on definitional and methodology.  The same thing with the Russian statistical agency, has had trainees at the IEA.  So, there's some movement.
\par \tab \tab On China specifically, there was a recognition, and it's widely, the article in the }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Post}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  about China's GDP statistics was recognized by the OECD several years ago, and there have been a couple of very high level studies done for the OECD which have come to the conclusion that Chinese GDP data, whether it was purchasing power parity method or standard method, was, let's say, grossly over stated, and that leads, of course, to the relationship between GDP and energy consumption, the energy intensity issue had important implications for global climate change.  So, this is out there and there's a lot of people working on it, and specifically on coal, the explanation that BP gave when it came out with its 2001 data on China was that despite the fact that coal production has fallen dramatically, that a large part of that may be the quality of the coal has improved in washing, it means that they are counting less rocks and dirt in the coal production than they used to because of improved coal washing techniques.  So, you might get almost as much BTUs out of a 15 percent less production, so this is }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  so, it just gives you some idea of what some of the intricacies of this data are all about.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Jae, do you have a comment?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR EDMONDS: Yes, I was just going to make a }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  Since China is such a big economy, it's }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  even though it's not big in the international markets today, it's probably bigger in the international markets than we realize because most of its imports of oil, for example, are off the books.  And, I think you raise an important question, in how do you cross check, and I think the only way to cross check is to begin to get some collaborating partnerships in China where you have some people that are, say, at the universities that you can call up and find out what's going on.
\par \tab \tab We are fortunate enough to have this relationship with the China Energy Research Institute that Bill Chandler established many years ago, and it gives us an opportunity to find out }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  there are some }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  just like here, there are times when an institution will change, for example, the way things }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  if something begins to be taxed sometimes it just disappears off the official records, or if you change the way things are counted.  And, I think coal consumption has been subject to some of those institutional changes, or at least the reported coal consumption, and so there are potential differences.
\par \tab \tab There are also ways to cross check independently on things like GDP.  You can kind of look at the steel production, some of the physical, some of the things that are going to come out in physical units, and you can see is this consistent.
\par \tab \tab But, I think that, and this goes back to the comment on the work that was being done in the international modeling and having local connections and contacts really can be extraordinarily valuable in doing this cross check.  So, I think that's probably the best, you know, there's no perfect solution to it, but that at least will give you a heads up.  Somebody there, if you have half a dozen different contacts spread around the country, somebody will spill the beans.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Well, thank you, and thank you, Jay and Nancy.

\par \tab \tab MS. PAUL: Mary Paul, CNEAF.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Well, once we iron out the additional technical difficulties, our next speaker will be Bob Schnapp on improving the quality of the annual nonutility data.
\par \tab \tab MR. SCHNAPP: Good morning.  I'm back again after a short respite.
\par \tab \tab Today, I'm going to talk to you about our nonutility data that EIA is working on.  Let me first explain, for those that aren't familiar with what a nonutility is.  A utility is an electric power generating station that has a franchised area, circumscribed area that it's supposed to serve, and it services that area no matter what, providing it with electricity, and in return, through certain regulations, it's allowed to get a certain rate of return.
\par \tab \tab Nonutilities are all those facilities that produce electricity but don't have a circumscribed area that they are supposed to be providing electricity to, so they typically produce electricity for themselves, their own use, or they usually sell it to another utility or to a power marketer to sell it on.  There are a few minor cases where they do sell directly to the end users.
\par \tab \tab That's kind of the basic differences between a utility and a nonutility.
\par \tab \tab So, the point of our project is to improve the accuracy of the data for the entire nation for electric generation, fuel consumption and thermal output, and to present the information in a consistent manner through all EIA publications and modeling.  And, we hope to complete this effort by August of this year.
\par \tab \tab The challenges that we face is to show the amount of electricity }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  well, we are coming up from the point of view of, if Congress asks us how much fuel is needed to produce a certain amount of electricity we want to make sure that we are accounting for everything, and it's been difficult in the past to account for the amount of electricity }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  not the amount of electricity that comes from nonutilities, but the amount of fuel that they use, because there are cogenerators.  Those are facilities that produce both electricity and thermal output, and we'll get into the reasons for the from, but that's kind of where we started this entire project from.
\par \tab \tab And, as I was saying, we want to present the information for nonutilities consistently throughout all of EIA's publications, and in that we would have representing independent power producers in particular, independent power producers are those that produce }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  their sole }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  their primary purpose, their primary business, to produce electricity.  Some of those may have been former utilities and are sold off and now are nonutilities, and then there are other cases where they were just, that was what they were set up to do in the first place.
\par \tab \tab The complications that we have, as I began to explain, was that cogenerators produce both thermal output and electricity from the same boiler, so if they have a boiler that produces steam, the steam gets used in producing electricity, the extra steam then gets used in the plant in some way, to heat it, or in processing, those are called topping cycles.  Bottoming cycles are those that produce steam, use the steam, the excess steam is then used to produce electricity.
\par \tab \tab But, it's difficult for the respondents to tell us in this boiler I'm using coal to make steam, and this amount of the coal is being used to produce the steam that's being used in the facility, and this amount of the coal is being used to produce electricity.  It's just not possible for them to tell us.  So, one of the things that we're going through here is to explain how we are going to separate out that fuel.
\par \tab \tab Historically, it's been very easy for us to report electric utility information on a consistent basis through the data publications and the forecasts.  That information has been consistent over time.  But, the nonutility, the information has been presented in  different ways, with different definitions throughout the different fuel and overall EIA publications. So, that's again another thing that we are addressing in this project.
\par \tab \tab So, the issues that we need to address, or have begun to address here, are several forms where we collect information.  First is the EIA-860B, which collects on an annual basis information from nonutility power producers.  There's the EIA-176 form that collects information on natural gas supply and disposition on an annual basis, and the EIA-3, which collects information on a quarterly basis from manufacturing plants that use coal. 
\par \tab \tab And then finally, the last issue that we'll address are how we are discussing to make representation of the information in our publications.
\par \tab \tab Turning first to the EIA-860B.  When we began this project, we tried to see how to make sure that all the information was consistent throughout all the publications, and as we looked more and more at the data comparing the data from the 860B with, say, for example, the 176, we found that there were many inconsistencies, and the more we looked at the data the more we saw that there were major problems with the EIA-860B data.
\par \tab \tab So, we set about assigning about ten people, between half and full time, to work just on going back and looking at 1998, 1999, and 2000 data.  So, that was the first thing that we did, we'll get into more detail, this is just kind of the things that we are going to be looking at in a moment here.
\par \tab \tab We'll talk to you how we clean the data, how we improved it, the results, how we developed the method for splitting apart the fuel for thermal output and electric generation, and then going back in time to 1989, how we are cleaning that data, and then strategies for avoiding these problems in the future.
\par \tab \tab So, looking at the first element there, which is the procedure for cleaning the data, we looked at the information and we decided to first look at one year, so we chose 1999, and we pretty much looked at }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  decided to just look at outliers, so we looked at the heat rate.  Heat rate is fuel consumption divided by electric generation, and that ratio should be around 10,000, you know, it could be as low as 6,000, as high as maybe 13,000, 14,000, 15,000, is kind of what we thought, but we took a wider range to make sure that we weren't going to be spending too many resources on this.  We only had a limited amount of time.
\par \tab \tab So, actually, the cutoff that we had was anything greater than 40,000 and anything less than 6,000.  After we began to clean that, we then looked at a couple of other cuts of the data.  We looked at capacity factors, if they were greater than 100 percent, what we found for the most part was that capacity factors up to 115 percent were acceptable, we physically called the utilities, I mean the power plants, and said, you know, this is what you say is your capacity, this is the amount of maximum generation you can possibly have from that, but you say it's even more than that, and they said, yeah, we're running flat out, we are really pushing the plant.  So, but those that were greater than 115 percent did admit that there was a problem and they needed to fix the data.
\par \tab \tab And then, we also looked at power-to-steam, that's electric generation over the amount of steam that was being produced, and we looked at those that were greater than one, the ratio was greater than one.  It turned out that many of those were okay, but when you have a ratio of 10,000 you kind of figure maybe there's something wrong.  It doesn't necessarily always mean that it's wrong, I must tell you, but it was another indicator that kind of pointed us in the direction of some facilities to call.
\par \tab \tab We started out by looking at the forms.  We had three years worth of forms in front of us, so we looked at the forms and we looked at the information in our computer file, and first corrected any things that were typed in incorrectly.  We then also looked at the forms in the database to see if there were errors of magnitude, such as if a decimal place was moved over one, two, or three places in one direction or the other when it shouldn't have been, we made those changes ourselves.
\par \tab \tab After that is when we began to contact the facilities.  So, 1999, I think we contacted about 600 facilities, just to recheck all their information. There are about 3,000 facilities in the entire census.
\par \tab \tab We then }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  after we were fairly comfortable with the 1999 data, we then went and we did the same procedure for 1998 and for 2000, and then Poonum Agranal did a special analysis for us, where she took the information and put them side by side, all three years, and did many, many cuts of the information, the data, for us.  I believe that we have some of that information out on the web site for you, that's only really a portion of what we have developed.
\par \tab \tab And that, again, began to point up to us other problems, heat rates for one }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I mean, say the total useful thermal output was two quads one year, and it was one quad the next year, and 1.5 quads the next year, it began to point out another problem and we started picking up more facilities that we needed to contact again.
\par \tab \tab And, this is }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I won't spend a lot of time on this, but this is kind of a before and after look.  Actually, this is a little bit further on down than the raw data that we started with, but you can see some of the changes that did occur here, that generation capacity after we cleaned it only changed by .2 percent, so it was fairly good.  Fuel consumption, total fuel consumption, only changed by about 8 percent.  Generation changed by almost 25 percent, and useful thermal output was way off the scale, and this we had always known was the worst data that we had of all.  And so, we cleaned that up and brought that down, like about 99 percent.
\par \tab \tab They are not identical, but there are similar patterns, this is for `99, where 50 percent change in useful thermal output, and in 2000 also useful thermal output was the worst.  So, you can see also here that fuel consumption }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  we were in the middle of collecting the 2000 data, so there were some really bad numbers here, but this was probably accounted for by just one or two facilities where we had moved the number over about six digits when we shouldn't have.
\par \tab \tab Now, let's talk about how we decided to split the amount of fuel between electric generation and thermal output.  As they can't really tell us how much fuel can be separated out into each of those two activities, we collect from them information on total electric generation, total fuel consumption, and then useful thermal output.  So, we have all the outputs and we have the total input.  The idea is how you split that apart.
\par \tab \tab We began with the assumption that useful }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  that the efficiency of the boiler to produce useful thermal output was 100 percent.  We tried a couple of different cuts of it, 90, 80, 70 percent, to see what it would do.  It certainly moved the data in different ways, but there were a couple of outside studies that were done, one in particular by Arthur Andersen that we fell back on, the consulting part, that showed that the boiler efficiency was about 80 percent.  It did differ by fuel type.  For the most part, it was about 80 percent, I think for one of the renewables it was about 74 percent, but after deep discussion we decided just to assume 80 percent across the board for all the fuels.
\par \tab \tab And so, what we did then was, we took useful thermal output, divided it by .8, and that gave us the total amount of BTUs of useful thermal output fuel consumption, took that, subtracted it from total fuel consumption, and the remainder was what was left for electric generation.  We divided that by electric generation to get the heat rate, to see if that made sense.  That's kind of the process that we went through.
\par \tab \tab We did not have on hand the pre-`98 data forms, all we have is the data file, and there are some problems with the data to start out with, for three years from 1995 to 1997 the form was changed to not collect useful thermal output at all.  In fact, the years before that and the years after that we were asking for only if you were a topping cycle to give us your useful thermal output, so if you were a bottoming cycle, that I explained before, you didn't report it at all, so we had to fill in for the `98, `99 and 2000 data, we called them and asked them for that data, but for the pre-`98 data we couldn't.  So, we are in the process right now, actually, the SMG folks, we have about six people that are helping us look at the information statistically to figure out how to fill in the holes and the problems.
\par \tab \tab We also know that the first two years of the data is probably the poorest quality of data, so we'll kind of have to see what comes out of that.  But, we started with, we looked at `98 and we made the comparisons before that, `97 on back, for the static information, so if they were a cogenerator we checked that, if they indicated for `98 that they were and before that they weren't, we automatically changed it so that they were.  
\par \tab \tab The capacity, if it was off by a factor of ten, 100, or 1,000, we changed it automatically to be the same that it was in 1998, and there were a whole host of things that we did along those lines.
\par \tab \tab After that is when we made the calculation for useful thermal output, fuel consumption for that, and then the heat rates, and made comparisons, and it was that information, we came up with about 900 unique facilities over those, whatever it is, nine years, that we needed to look at.  But, a number }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  about half of those, it turns out, are just missing, at the moment, useful thermal output, so we are going to back calculate them from a selected heat rate that we are going to choose for the individual facility, generate the useful thermal output, calculate the heat rate, and if that then falls outside of the range then we'll put that back into the mix and look at their fuel consumption and useful thermal output again.
\par \tab \tab So, we hope to have that done in about five weeks or so.
\par \tab \tab We have been collecting 2001 data.  The 860B form has gone away, and we now collect the information monthly for electric generation, useful thermal output and fuel consumption on a monthly basis from a sample of all the nonutilities.  And so, the 2001 data, we have gone back to look at that to make sure it's consistent with the 2000 data, and right now we've identified about 220 facilities that we need to take a second look at, and we are in the process of doing that now. In probably another week or so, we'll have those cleaned up, then start cutting in a couple of other different ways to see if there's any other facilities that pop out to us.
\par \tab \tab So, from this we are learning that there are some things that we need to put in place to make sure that we can avoid having these problems again in the future.  For the 906 form, the monthly form, by having the 2001 cleaned up we think we'll be starting from a good base and then can move forward from there.
\par \tab \tab With our new systems that I described to you yesterday afternoon, we have extensive online edits for those that either inputting the information on the other side of the internet or for us, those are edits that we had before, plus, particularly, for the 906 an extensive amount of new edits that we put in place from a lot of the information that we gathered from this project.
\par \tab \tab We have right now kind of a crude, not very crude, but a somewhat crude graphical editing system that looks at the information, shows major outliers, and we're going to be programming that into the system so that we can more easily do quick intelligent graphical editing to show us things that are sitting outside of the range.
\par \tab \tab Performance measures, which I described to you yesterday afternoon, we'll be putting in }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I put a draft into the 906 and when we start getting out 2002 monthly data we'll start running that and see what it's telling us.
\par \tab \tab We also probably need to work with the respondents a little bit more to help train them on the forms, and then routinely compare the information we collect on the monthly 906 with the quarterly coal EIA-3.
\par \tab \tab I explained that we weren't comparing the 860B to some of the other forms. I'll just quickly go over what we did with the 906 and the 3, I won't get into much detail here, but the 176 asks those that deliver natural gas for the line of business that their customer is in.  And, they have to guess at it, essentially, they might know, but they may not know truly, in fact, what they are.  So, there is some guessing involved in that.
\par \tab \tab And, when we compare the 176 and the 860B, there are }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  before we started this project there were major inconsistencies, certainly at the national level, and very much so at the state level. After the process we've gone through, the national level does not seem to be a problem anymore, the states, there are still some that still need to be looked at, and I think the natural gas people are also taking a look at how they are collecting the information, and we are trying to provide them with some more information that we are collecting so that they can go back and talk to their respondents.
\par \tab \tab On EIA-3, there are 94 manufacturing plants that generate electricity, so, therefore, they fill out both the 3 and the 860B, and now the 906.  At the national level, they compare pretty well for 1999, they differed, they were within 2 percent of each other.  But, we took a much closer look at them, and there are 12 common respondents that differed by more than 10 percent or 100,000 tons, and so we called them to find out what the issue was.
\par \tab \tab It turns out that there were about five facilities that we wound up changing their data on for the 860B, and I think there was one or two, or maybe three, on the EIA-3 that had to be changed, but the others were okay.  That was because the EIA-3 had a higher number than the 860B, and you can have that case where there's a boiler that produces steam for the plant that is not hooked up in any way producing electricity into the grid.  So, we wouldn't want that on the 860B, but the EIA-3 would, and we literally talked with each person on this form to make sure that what we were getting was right. So, that made us actually feel a lot better, that out of all these there are only a few that we had to change.
\par \tab \tab For the data presentation, let me just quickly go over with you the types of changes we are talking about for the new Electric Power Monthly that we designed and are programming now, the new Annual Energy Review that we've kind of hashed out over many meetings with about 20 people sitting in the room, and then the other publications that are going to have to be modified in the future once all this work is done.
\par \tab \tab The Electric Power Monthly, we are going to be showing electric generation, fuel consumption, fuel stocks, fuel receipts and costs, both for the entire industry }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  also for the entire industry, for electric utilities only, for independent power producers only, and then for cogenerators.  We are also splitting apart the cogenerator fuel consumption and stocks, and so what we will be presenting is total fuel consumption and then the fuel consumption that we're estimating for electric generation, and the fuel consumption we are estimating for useful thermal output.
\par \tab \tab This way, people will be able to go from the Electric Power Monthly and look and see the quarterly coal report, or the Natural Gas Monthly, and see consistent numbers, because we are breaking this down much more than we had in the past, and it will be easier to make those comparisons.
\par \tab \tab The Annual Energy Review certainly is going to be emphasizing consistency in content and display for the electric sector, as well as all of the fuel sectors.  What they are going to be presenting is electric utilities and independent power producers, and then the commercial sector, and separately the industrial sector, and end use tables will be modified to show cogenerators versus other usage by the industrial sector and in the commercial sector.
\par \tab \tab Again, all this will be consistent with the Electric Power Monthly, and then as we are designing right now the Electric Power Annual.
\par \tab \tab The other publications they are going to have to follow, that will have to come into line with all of this work, are the Natural Gas Annual and Monthly, the quarterly and annual coal reports, the Renewable Energy Annual, Emissions of Greenhouse Gases, the Fuel Oil and Kerosene Report, and then the two forecasting models, the short-term energy outlook and the annual energy outlook.  And so that, they will all be }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  they will all have the exact same definition and be showing things in a consistent manner.
\par \tab \tab And so, the questions that we have for the committee are, how do we alert our users to all the massive changes that we're going to be making, because as you can see just by changing the electric area it has tentacles out into every fuel, and every model, and every publication, that EIA produces.
\par \tab \tab And then, we're wondering if there's any volunteers to help us improve our edits and quality control procedures, and if there are they should see Nancy.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: All right, thank you, and our ASA discussant is Johnny Blair.
\par \tab \tab MR. BLAIR: The first thing I'm going to do is to expand your initial question.  I think that you need to do something for some things in addition to alerting the users that you are going to be }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  that you are making these changes.
\par \tab \tab In the earlier discussion, as I was listening to it, about information quality guidelines, it struck me that the kind of problem that you are facing here of alerting users and how to deal with changes in data presentation belong maybe as a footnote but someplace as part of information quality guidelines, because it certainly affects the ability of the users to make use of the data and is a quality issue.  
\par \tab \tab And so, I would suggest, first of all, taking a little bit broader look at this, and not seeing it so much as just a one-time effort directed at the things that you've just gone through.  You could, perhaps, look at this as a model for how to think about these things being done in the future, though they may not be as massive, the issues may be quite similar, and I think by taking a step back in that fashion that it might also give you a way to take a more structured approach to the present problem of disseminating this information about the changes that you are going to be making.
\par \tab I looked at this from the point of view of if I were a user of these data, or of other data, what kinds of things I would want to know, or how I, as a customer, would want to be treated, and that's why I say that, you know, I think it's more than just alerting the users, but certainly it starts with that.
\par \tab \tab And, one question that relates to that is, sort of how do you }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  or when, rather, do you alert the users? It can be that, you know, someone just goes to the web site and, lo and behold, you know, there are lots of different things, publications turn up, and, you know, they are different, and I thought about data that I use like CPS data, and as a user of that data if that's how I found out about changes, you know, that it just kind of turned up, you know, that wouldn't go over well with me.
\par \tab \tab And so, there's, I think, a customer relations aspect to it, and that would help people to, you know, plan their work, to kind of know what's coming, if they are users of these data, given the massive changes that you are talking about.
\par \tab \tab And so, I think that one of the things that you want to look at then is whether you want to do something in advance, and if so sort of how do you go about doing that, and certainly one part of that, and, you know, I don't know what the whole process might be, but one part of that I think is a technical document that goes over some of the points that you've just discussed, that is, that helps the users to understand what's the thinking behind these changes, you know, why has this been done, and, you know, not just seeing sort of what's been done, but understanding what underlies it, and creating that document and making it available on the web site, and then pointing our users to it.
\par \tab \tab As far as the modes of alerting users of these changes, I think you'd want to use multiple modes, and follow the same paths that you do in data dissemination, so that, obviously, there would be something on the web site, and you would want to, I think tie that to what you see as, you know, the key points of entry on the web site, and then, you know, if you have a mailing list, you know, that the various publications are sent to, you know, that you want to use that.  So, it seems to me the logical approach for alerting is to follow the paths that people use to obtain the data.
\par \tab \tab Then, it struck me that the second thing that I would want as a user is some sort of guide to searching for or finding out, you know, where are these changes.  So, if it's something on the web, some sort of navigational tool that would help me to find these changes, and for them to be, you know, clearly marked so that, you know, I don't have to, you know, do a lot of work to see where changes have been made.
\par \tab \tab And then the third thing that I would like would be some sort of explanation or information about the change, and this could be something very abbreviated, and I know you have a system now that involves, you know, various kinds of markings for revised, and this may be nothing more than a revised or somewhat expanded coding system that tells the user a bit more about particular data items or particular reports, and why there were changes made there.
\par \tab \tab Then finally, I would certainly, as a user, want some sort of a feedback process, that is, where do I go to get questions answered if I have questions about the new reports, where is information, you know, posted, or, you know, how can I find out about, you know, if there are ongoing corrections, you know, how are they flagged, you know, some sort of information source, that is, to not assume that, you know, we put this out here, it's going to stand on its own, no one is going to have any questions about it, they'll just start using it, and everybody will be happy, but to assume sort of the opposite, that people are going to have lots of questions, and that there needs to be some mechanism for dealing with those.
\par \tab \tab And then finally, in this notion of taking a structured approach after you }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  you know, if you take this kind of model, certainly you want to do some testing of it, some sort of usability testing, and I would look at this as simply, you know, once this is up, you know, selecting some small number, you know, of different types of users, and, you know, asking them to go through and give you their comments on it.  You might, you know, structure, you know, how you want them to go through certain kinds of things that you want them to try to do, and then give you feedback on it.  But, whatever approach you take, whether it's the kinds of things I'm suggesting or something else, I would assume always that you need to do some sort of testing, that nothing comes out the first time perfect without the need for some revisions, and that that should be part of the planning process.
\par \tab \tab So, those were really all the comments that I have, and I just wanted to also take a moment to thank Renee Miller, who helped me understand a bit about what was going on here, so, hopefully, I was at least on point, and the quality of the points you'll have to decide, but that was my take on it.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Thank you, Johnny, very much.
\par \tab \tab Did you have some comments or questions for Johnny in response?
\par \tab \tab MR. SCHNAPP: Well, Doctor Blair, I think they have some very good comments.  In particular, you know, putting together a technical document to explain the types of changes, why we are doing it, and what we did, and hooking it, you know, to }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  whatever is on the web there to it.  I think that's an excellent idea.
\par \tab \tab Internally, at least for the Electric Power Monthly, because we are redesigning it and having all these changes, we've already begun to put together a flier to send out to people and put on to the internet, but I think what you are describing is something more than that, and so we are going to have to kind of evaluate what that is, but that, again, is a good idea.
\par \tab \tab I think I understood your idea of the structural approach in other areas.  I guess we are kind of doing that continually on the fly. We started with 860B, it's moved into the 176, it's now moved into, I don't even know the form number, the fuel oil and kerosene area, the MECS and SEDS data has been drawn in now, so when you start comparing the information and making }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  trying to make sure everything is consistent, you start seeing things in a different light.
\par \tab \tab And so, this particular project, which, you know, people possibly looked at as being something short term, is probably one of the most massive efforts that EIA has ever made to, not just correct its data, but to make sure that everything is internally consistent, and that we present it to the public well, and that we improve the quality of the information that we are providing to them.
\par \tab \tab Personally, I have like ten people working on this, between half and full time.  We have two-hour meetings every week with at least 20 people in them.  The petroleum people have more people involved now, SEDS and MECS data folks have begun to be involved, the natural gas people are, and we have people involved in the meetings that are with the models as well.  
\par \tab \tab So, really, its tentacles are all the way out there, and it's good that we are doing this, it's very good that we are doing this, and, you know, I think it's a major step forward for EIA.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Neha, did you have a comment?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KHANNA: Yes.  I had a suggestion, and you can tell me whether it's feasible or not, and that is that maybe if there was a single document with change and enhancements, because if you put it on the web now, let's say this was going to become effective on the web the end of this month, for the next several months when it's highlighted on the web all of us will notice it, five years later when there's a new person coming to the EIA the man might not even notice that there were some changes.  If there was a single document which was }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  then you could go back and say, you know, here is this sort of information.  That might be a way of ensuring consistency at the user end.
\par \tab \tab MR. SCHNAPP: Yes.  That shouldn't be a problem in archiving it.  Documents that we don't have right on the web site are archived, and we can easily get to those, and this is probably a document, depending on what it looks like, that we need to keep in the forefront.
\par \tab \tab But, the document that I have in my mind at the moment, I'm concentrating on the 860B, but what you are talking about, all of the changes that are going on, and there are many of them, that we are going to have to somehow coordinate that in how we present that.
\par \tab \tab But, that's a very good idea.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Nicolas?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HENGARTNER: Yes.
\par \tab \tab To some extent, I like Neha's idea, what if it's like in software, it would be great to have, you know, Energy Reports 2.0001, and then next time there's an update, change a little bit the number.  It's not a joke, it actually would be helpful, and it's the same }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  each time you make a numerical change have a change log, even for }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  not only for procedures, but use the numbers as well to change and update.  That way, you can go back and we know }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  you look back, say okay, this is what the change has been done since the last revision, and just having those numbers, people are now used to software.  So, that might be something to think about, I mean, make a pitch also for data quality.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: That's a good idea.  Thank you very much, and thank you very much for your presentation, appreciate it.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: I'd like to move on now to some }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  I know a lot of people are here for the graphics contest, and over dinner last night the committee discussed and reviewed all the submissions, and we liked many of them very much, and I'll turn the meeting over now to Mary Hutzler, who will present the winners of that contest.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: I have both the pleasure and the honor to present the graphic contest awards.  This contest started nine years ago, and Jay Hakes, the prior EIA Administrator, started it.  Its objective was to improve the graphics within EIA.
\par \tab \tab It has a two-part process, where analysts recommend their graphics to Bill }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  staff in EIA recommend their graphics to Bill, and then he gets a team of EIA staff together to make the first cut, and then the final graphic winners are selected by the committee.  And, as Carol already mentioned, they did that last night.
\par \tab \tab The first winner, and someone is putting the graph up, is, I want to make sure the graph and the winner match so I'm waiting for the graph to get up, okay, the first winner is James Tobin, for this graph, "Miles of Additional Natural Gas Pipeline }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  Expansions vs. New Pipelines," and it appeared in the }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure Issues and Operational Trends}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  report.  It illustrates the growth of natural gas pipeline mileage since 1997 and the degree to which new pipeline development has out paced expansions over the past several years.
\par \tab \tab The committee thought that this graphic was very simple and displayed the information very well, and I'd like Jim to come up to get his award.
\par \tab \tab (Applause.)
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Thank you, Jim.
\par \tab \tab MR. TOBIN: Thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: I'm waiting for the logistics, but does anybody have any comments on that last graph?  Okay.  Well, I think we're almost ready for the next one.
\par \tab \tab Okay, go ahead.  Okay, this graph, and I'm not sure if everything is up there on the graph, it is?  Okay.  But, it's titled, "Petroleum Marketing Data Collection."  It appeared in Data Collection Systems: Orientation For Summer Interns.  The graphic helps to show the interconnectivity of marketing systems and the EIA reports that collect data in those markets, and  Cynthia McLaughlin is the winner of this particular graphic.  I don't think Cynthia is here, but I think Ann is going to accept the award for her.
\par \tab \tab The committee felt that this graphic was extremely helpful with understanding EIA collection forms and how they fit in, in the total system, and they thought it would be very good if we had it in electricity, Bob, so another project you can add to your list.
\par \tab \tab MS. WHITFIELD: Thank you.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Thank you.
\par \tab \tab (Applause.)
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: While we are waiting for the next picture to come up, anybody have any comments on the last one, any thoughts, any suggestions to Bob as to how you want the electricity one designed?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: Only by }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  what, is it October or November that we are meeting again?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: October
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR KENT: October.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HAMMITT: Yes.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: By the next meeting, Bob.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR PHIPPS: You could go back in history, too, so we'd know where all those other ones came from.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Okay, ready?
\par \tab \tab Okay.  This next one is new for EIA in the sense that this particular graphic }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  it's actually a set of graphics, there are three here }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  is a web-based graphic only, and, in fact, you can see different movement, I believe, in these graphs.
\par \tab \tab This is in a new release for EIA, it's called This Week in Petroleum.  This Week in Petroleum presents petroleum price and volume data for 13 series compared with previous years data for that series.  The graph changes as you scroll over the label, letting the user easily contrast the different but related series.
\par \tab \tab There were two people who worked on these graphics, Lamar Gowan and Charles Reiner.  If they can come up for their award, or do we need another fill in?  Ann?
\par \tab \tab MS. WHITFIELD: I think I'll just stay up here.
\par \tab \tab Thank you very much.
\par \tab \tab (Applause.)
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: And, the last one is actually a brochure that you folks have seen a lot of, because it was first introduced by Steve Durbin yesterday in his presentation about human capital management.  This brochure was developed by Colleen Blessing, and it's entitled, "Come Work With Us."  It highlights the benefits of working for the government, and EIA in particular, beautiful photos would entice candidates to pick up the brochure and take a look, contact information is provided.
\par \tab \tab And, the committee felt that this brochure was very well laid out. It had bulleted areas, and it communicated very well, and that the topics picked were well done as well.  So, we would like to thank Colleen, and, Ann, do you want to come up again to get this award for her?
\par \tab \tab MS. WHITFIELD: This is legitimate this time.
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Oh, you also worked on this?
\par \tab \tab MS. WHITFIELD: Well }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: Okay, all right, well, here you go, Ann.  Thank you.
\par \tab \tab (Applause.)
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: The winners not only get their certificates, but they get on-the-spot awards, and they also get taken to lunch, and I think Nancy does that, right?
\par \tab \tab Okay.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Thank you.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR SITLER: Can I ask who came up with the "Come Work With Us" logo?  Has it been around?
\par \tab \tab MS. HUTZLER: The slogan.
\par \tab \tab MS. WHITFIELD: It was kind of a joint effort on the part of Colleen, myself and John Weiner.  We were trying to get some information out there to the new recruits from EIA, and so Colleen and I got together and it just happened.  We put together a lot of information, and Colleen was very good in doing a lot of quick site information, sort of a quick read, but it was just }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  it wasn't anything that was long term, it was just we needed something for the recruits.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR SITLER: Well, I think that, I mean, in my opinion, that's probably the most interesting part.  I really commend it. I like the feel, because it's sort of a combination of colloquialism and it reads well.
\par \tab \tab MS. WHITFIELD: Well, we had a lot of fun working on it, I mean, it was really something we felt was worthwhile, and I was very pleased that it turned out the way it did.
\par \tab \tab Thank you for your comments.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR SITLER: Yes, congratulations.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Right now we are in the process, I guess, of closing the meeting.  Are there any questions or comments from any of the committee members?
\par \tab \tab I'd just like to mention a couple of things, that if you are staying for lunch we are going to try and brainstorm some ideas for the next meeting.  If you are not staying, or if you think of something afterwards, please e-mail me and let me know.
\par \tab \tab I'm looking for volunteers who want the opportunity to present an invited paper at the Joint Statistical Meetings in San Francisco, and I'll need to really firm that up by June or July.
\par \tab \tab And then finally, I'm also looking for suggestions for mathematical statisticians to replace Roy Whitmore and myself when we rotate off at the end of the year.  So, feel free to give me your suggestions for those, and know that I'll probably be in contact with many of you outside of this committee, outside of this meeting, for particular suggestions that you might have.
\par \tab \tab It's been brought to my attention that one of our attendees couldn't make the meeting yesterday, but would now like to make a public comment on human capital management, but I don't have his name.  So, does that ring a bell to }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  okay.
\par \tab \tab MR. WEISSMAN: Am I on?  I'm just trying to see if it's }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  okay, I'm Carl Weissman with ASTM.  I didn't think of this until today, but the predicament of a college freshman is that's what hot when he selects a major will be cold when he graduates. And, a senior has the same predicament, because what's hot when he selects a graduate program is going to be cold when he gets his degree.
\par \tab \tab Now, if I understood correctly what EIA's predicament is, it's that you need to have lots of people entering educational programs now, so that when your big bulge of new requirements for skills to replace retirements comes out, there will be a big pool to recruit from.
\par \tab \tab So, I think you need to put some emphasis on making sure that university departments know this, so that they can use it to recruit majors and graduate students in time for you to have them.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Thank you, and I think that's a very important point, and I'd just like to restress something.  Are you thinking about it?  Do you want to stress again?
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR SITLER: In response to my question on citizenship around this, was sort of misdirected.  I wasn't complaining about Canadians coming, I don't want Canadians to come here that much.  It's more about something that most of us, as faculty members, are aware of, either because we work in the United States, as Nicolas does, or because we went through your graduate programs, as we also did, and that is there are almost no U.S. citizens in statistical sciences in your graduate programs, and I really mean that, and it's been there for a long, long time.
\par \tab \tab When I went in, say, mid to late `80s, the University of Wisconsin, which is a huge program, 120 graduate students, the Canadians outnumbered the Americans, and there were only six of us, and not one of those Americans went on to a Ph.D., they all stopped at the M.Sc. level.
\par \tab \tab I happen to know that fact because there were at least three full ticket scholarships available only to U.S. citizenships that were unfilled for a number of years.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: And, I know that was true when I was a graduate student.  I graduated from Iowa State in 1989, and one of the last lectures that Oscar Kempthorne gave in linear models before he retired was, where are all the American graduate students, because they weren't there, and that's, what has that been, 12 or 13 years ago.  So, it's gotten a lot worse.
\par \tab \tab So, I think the gentleman's point is very well taken, that, you know }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  and if you couple that with Randy's comment, then you need to let the universities know the type of person that you are going to be needing, so that they can channel their recruitment efforts in that area, because right now you wouldn't have anybody to select from.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HENGARTNER: See, it's even worse than that, they don't even apply to our program.  I'm Director of Graduate Studies at Yale in Statistics, this year we had zero U.S. candidates for teaching statistics at Yale.  There's something that }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  there's not interest in statistics, I guess, or something is going on, but there's no way you are going to have recruits if they don't even enter the pipeline.  It's not that we don't accept them or anything, they don't even apply.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Right.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR HENGARTNER: So, it is a problem.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: So, you know, that might be something, I don't know if you are interested in, Nancy, you know, the ASA has various committees to look into statistical education at various levels, and I know that K through 12 has been a really high topic, that, you know, maybe we ought to be thinking about after 12, and, you know, what's happening to these people in college that they are }{\f22\expnd0\expndtw-3 \uc1\u-4029\'3f}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  are they not going to college?  I don't think so, but they are not going from college to graduate school, at least in statistics.
\par \tab \tab DOCTOR SITLER: Let me make one follow-up comment.
\par \tab \tab You have something you can look at, and that's the U.K.  Margaret Thatcher kind of decimated their civil service, and what happened was, a lot of students stopped going into these fields.  And, they had to recreate programs.  
\par \tab \tab Most of the people I work with at the Office of National Statistics, their undergraduate degrees were in everything but statistics.  They had to create programs, they would hire these people from programs like geography, that had good high school math, and then they would reeducate them in one and two year sort of civil service graduate programs, specifically, designed to create statisticians.
\par \tab \tab CHAIR CRAWFORD: Thank you.
\par \tab \tab Any final questions or comments?
\par \tab \tab With that then, I'd like to adjourn the meeting.
\par \tab \tab Thank you very much.
