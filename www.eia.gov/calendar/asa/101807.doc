\par 
\par            3              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think we should
\par 
\par            4    get going.  We were supposed to start at
\par 
\par            5    8:30, but we still have some of the Committee
\par 
\par            6    members missing.  So we waited for them a
\par 
\par            7    little bit.  Looks like maybe there is a
\par 
\par            8    major Metro delay that we are not of aware of
\par 
\par            9    or something like that has happened.
\par 
\par           10              But we do need to get going, and I
\par 
\par           11    think as Murphy's Law will have it, I think
\par 
\par           12    the moment we start, I think they're all
\par 
\par           13    going to walk in; right?  So let us see if it
\par 
\par           14    works.
\par 
\par           15              First of all, I'm Nagaraj Neerchal,
\par 
\par           16    Chair of this committee.  This committee is
\par 
\par           17    called Committee on Energy Statistics.  This
\par 
\par           18    is an ASA Committee.  It's a Committee that's
\par 
\par           19    appointed by American Statistical
\par 
\par           20    Association, and specifically it's not an EIA
\par 
\par           21    Committee.
\par 
\par           22              But our function is to provide

\par            1    feedback to EIA on the presentation they make
\par 
\par            2    us, or any other any other issue that they
\par

\par 
\par            4              The meeting is open to the public,
\par 
\par            5    and public comments are welcome.  And in the
\par 
\par            6    agenda, which you can pick up on the hallway
\par 
\par            7    outside, there is time set aside for public
\par 
\par            8    to make comment.  And make sure that you come
\par 
\par            9    to the microphones when you make those
\par 
\par           10    comments, because they are being recorded.
\par 
\par           11    And of course, written comments are welcome
\par 
\par           12    and may be sent to either ASA -- that is me
\par 
\par           13    or Kristen Campbell -- or to EIA.
\par 
\par           14              I would like to just point out that
\par 
\par           15    you need to sign your name and e-mail and
\par 
\par           16    details on the sign-up sheet outside as you
\par 
\par           17    are walking in -- on that table.  If you have
\par 
\par           18    not done so, please go ahead and sign your
\par 
\par           19    name and e-mail address.  Those who are not
\par 
\par           20    familiar with this building -- that includes
\par 
\par           21    me probably -- restrooms are at the end of
\par 
\par           22    the hall on either side.

\par 
\par            4    Campbell and Donna-Renee Arrington are the
\par 
\par            5    ASA representatives here.  You might have
\par 
\par            6    seen them as you were walking in at the desk
\par 
\par            7    there and -- those who are -- the Committee
\par 
\par            8    members already know about this routine.
\par 
\par            9    Those new members will know that they are the
\par 
\par           10    people we talk to in terms of reimbursement
\par 
\par           11    and other logistics-related issues.
\par 
\par           12              Now, we do have a transcriber, and
\par 
\par           13    to make sure that your comments are
\par 
\par           14    transcribed properly, please lean towards the
\par 
\par           15    microphone and speak, and people who are in
\par 
\par           16    the audience, please come to the microphone,
\par 
\par           17    state your name and then make your comment.
\par 
\par           18    This will make it easier for the transcriber.
\par 
\par           19              I think we do have one n\ltrpar ew member
\par 
\par           20    who is obviously here, I think.  It's my
\par 
\par           21    pleasure to welcome John Weyant.
\par 
\par           22              Am I saying it right?

\par            3    Director of the Energy Modeling Forum at
\par 
\par            4    Stanford University.  Thank you very much for
\par 
\par            5    agreeing to serve on the Committee; we
\par 
\par            6    welcome you.

\par 
\par            8              MR. NEERCHAL:  The Committee
\par 
\par            9    members obviously know this, Alethea Jennings
\par 
\par           10    she is right here, and Bill Weinig, who I
\par 
\par           11    think just stepped out -- are the EIA liaison
\par 
\par           12    for the Committee, and Alethea is taking over
\par 
\par           13    big-time from Bill, and I think the rumor is
\par 
\par           14    that -- is it a rumor or is it confirmed now?
\par 
\par           15              MS. JENNINGS:  Uh-huh.
\par 
\par           16              SPEAKER:  It's a confirmed rumor.
\par 
\par           17              MR. NEERCHAL:  Okay.  The rumor is
\par 
\par           18    that Bill is retiring in the first quarter of
\par 
\par           19    2008, and I think that we will be relying
\par 
\par           20    more and more on Alethea afterwards.  And we
\par 
\par           21    obviously will have Bill's cell phone no
\par 
\par           22    matter where he goes; right?

\par            1              So Alethea, thank you very much for
\par 
\par            2    taking over and helping out.  What else do I
\par 
\par            3    want to say?  Some of our Committee members
\par 
\par            4    are not here, so we ad lib on the agenda when
\par 
\par            5    they get here.
\par 
\par            6              I think that the next item we
\par 
\par            7    should be doing is to go ahead and introduce
\par 
\par            8    ourselves, so let's go ahead and introduce
\par 
\par            9    ourselves.  So we start from the Committee
\par 
\par           10    members.  Please speak into the microphone
\par 
\par           11    and when we are done at the table here then
\par 
\par           12    we go to the audience members.
\par 
\par           13              Please come to the microphone one
\par 
\par           14    at a time and introduce yourself.

\par 
\par           19    believe, and this is also my first year of
\par 
\par           20    being Chair -- second meeting as a Chair.

\par            4    h\ltrpar onoring Neha and Jay later, but want to
\par 
\par            5    personally thank the -- Neha's here, and Jay,
\par 
\par            6    for all their services.  It's been really
\par 
\par            7    terrific having your advice.
\par 
\par            8              As you know, we always try to bring
\par 
\par            9    you up-to-date on what's happening in EIA
\par 
\par           10    since our last meeting in April, and it's
\par 
\par           11    been a very busy time with the new Congress,
\par 
\par           12    which came in -- as of early January of this
\par 
\par           13    year has been particularly active in -- and
\par 
\par           14    I'll point to some of the specifics of the
\par 
\par           15    work we've been doing for Congress.
\par 
\par           16              But let me start with a list of the
\par 
\par           17    items that we're going to talk about.  Most
\par 
\par           18    importantly is our '08 budget, bringing you
\par 
\par           19    up-to-date on that, and to talk about the
\par 
\par           20    Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report, which as
\par 
\par           21    of 1 October became a principal economic
\par

\par 
\par 
\par            1              We've released just last week our
\par 
\par            2    winter fuels outlook.  We're going to release
\par 
\par            3    our long-term outlook on December 5th if all
\par 
\par            4    goes according to schedule.
\par 
\par            5              And as I mentioned, we've had a
\par 
\par            6    large number of service reports for Congress
\par 
\par            7    that have either already been completed or
\par 
\par            8    are in the process of being worked on now.
\par 
\par            9    I'll mention a few of those specifically, and
\par 
\par           10    in some cases involving work that this
\par 
\par           11    committee has been directly involved in with
\par 
\par           12    respect to the methodology, and the advice
\par 
\par           13    and counsel that we've received from you.
\par 
\par           14              Another exciting development that
\par 
\par           15    you've been aware of in various meetings
\par 
\par           16    about -- the Internet data collection process
\par 
\par           17    that we continue to expand, and hopefully
\par 
\par           18    will -- you know, almost all of our
\par 
\par           19    electricity surveys are collected by Internet
\par 
\par           20    data collection now, and we're expanding
\par 
\par           21    that -- we'll talk about that a little bit.

\par 
\par            4    of us have been around that long.
\par 
\par            5              We're going to have a celebratory
\par 
\par            6    conference in April of '08, and certainly
\par 
\par            7    looking forward to ASA participation, and
\par 
\par            8    this committee's participation, in that
\par 
\par            9    meeting.  Margot is going to go into more
\par 
\par           10    detail about that.
\par 
\par           11              Just to bring you up-to-date on
\par 
\par           12    where we are on the budget -- we are
\par 
\par           13    currently operating under a continuing
\par 
\par           14    resolution at the fiscal year '07 budget
\par 
\par           15    level, which was a little over $90 million.
\par 
\par           16    We were really looking, and are looking
\par 
\par           17    forward to the passage of the fiscal '08
\par 
\par           18    budget.
\par 
\par           19              Hopefully it will be done before
\par 
\par           20    Congress goes on recess for the Thanksgiving

\par            1    December.
\par 
\par            2              That's particularly important
\par 
\par            3    because it contains for the first time a real
\par 
\par            4    increase in EIA's budget, which we have
\par 
\par            5    talked about in this committee -- and some
\par 
\par            6    other things that we would like to do with
\par 
\par            7    that additional funding, including the
\par 
\par            8    redesign of EIA's national energy model that
\par 
\par            9    many of you have been directly or indirectly
\par 
\par           10    involved in.
\par 
\par           11              We would also like to spend some
\par 
\par           12    money on improving the petroleum natural gas
\par 
\par           13    data reliability and accuracy, and we've have
\par 
\par           14    talked about some of the forms and the
\par 
\par           15    methodology and surveys that we are involved
\par 
\par           16    in, and this committee has been very helpful
\par 
\par           17    in that.
\par 
\par           18              And then the collection of biofuel
\par 
\par           19    data, particularly ethanol -- clearly was not
\par 
\par           20    in the minds of the creators of EIA in 1977.
\par 
\par           21    And therefore, we do not have any surveys
\par 
\par           22    that are collecting ethanol data to the

\par 
\par 
\par            1    degree of timeliness and accuracy that we
\par 
\par            2    would like, and certainly that the Congress
\par 
\par            3    would like, and therefore, we have budgeted
\par 
\par            4    about $2 million in the fiscal '08 budget to
\par 
\par            5    begin collecting ethanol data on a weekly
\par 
\par            6    basis.  That certainly is something that is
\par 
\par            7    long overdue, and we look forward to doing
\par 
\par            8    that.
\par 
\par            9              Another piece of good news is that
\par 
\par           10    just three weeks ago, we were notified by OMB
\par 
\par           11    that our natural gas -- working gas and
\par 
\par           12    storage survey which is released -- Thursday
\par 
\par           13    morning, it'll be released in about an hour
\par 
\par           14    and a half from now, has become designated a
\par 
\par           15    principal indicator as of 1 October, '07.
\par 
\par           16              And this is the first time EIA's
\par 
\par           17    had that distinction, and it certainly
\par 
\par           18    recognizes the importance of this particular
\par 
\par           19    data set for the economy of the United
\par 
\par           20    States.  It's one of 38 principal economic
\par 
\par           21    indicators.  There's more information about
\par 
\par           22    that on the OMB website.

\par 
\par 
\par            1              Just as an example of the storage
\par 
\par            2    data that we took over actually from the
\par 
\par            3    American Gas Association -- I think it was
\par 
\par            4    about '03-04.  This truly has been a
\par 
\par            5    market-mover every Thursday morning at about
\par 
\par            6    10:30.  You can see natural gas prices go up
\par 
\par            7    or down depending on whether our number meets
\par 
\par            8    the expectations of market participants, and
\par 
\par            9    indeed we are very much in the forefront of
\par 
\par    \ltrpar        10    natural gas data market movement.  And in
\par 
\par           11    some ways, it reflects actually -- and we're
\par 
\par           12    pleased about that, and this has gone very
\par 
\par           13    well -- I can't say enough about the
\par 
\par           14    methodological development that Nancy was
\par 
\par           15    involved in in Natural Gas Division, in the
\par 
\par           16    collection and the quality of the data.
\par 
\par           17              All that is great, but one of the
\par 
\par           18    reasons this moves markets is it's one of the
\par 
\par           19    few data points that really gives market
\par 
\par           20    participants some idea what's going on in
\par 
\par           21    natural gas markets.  We really don't have a
\par

\par 
\par 
\par            1    gas production is -- probably about a 60-day
\par 
\par            2    lag -- and that's due to the good work of an
\par 
\par            3    advice of this Committee and the natural gas
\par 
\par            4    production data collection that we are now
\par 
\par            5    doing on a monthly basis on our own sample as
\par 
\par            6    opposed to relying on state data, and on the
\par 
\par            7    consumption side, the lag is even longer than
\par 
\par            8    that.
\par 
\par            9              So what I'm saying is that this one
\par 
\par           10    data point which is obviously crucial to
\par 
\par           11    getting a picture of what's going on in

\par 
\par           13    perhaps even overly -- markets are even
\par 
\par           14    overly sensitive to it because of its unique
\par 
\par           15    quality.
\par 
\par           16              I mentioned that we just released
\par 
\par           17    our winter fuels outlook, and one of the -- I
\par 
\par           18    know many of you know this -- but one of the
\par 
\par           19    things that the public law that created EIA
\par 
\par           20    in 1977 stipulated is that we should have a
\par 
\par           21    national energy information system, and that

\par 
\par            2    form of energy in the United States.
\par 
\par            3              But it also mandated us to do
\par 
\par            4    forecasting, both short- and long-term
\par 
\par            5    forecasting, which makes us somewhat unique
\par 
\par            6    in the statistical community.  One of the
\par 
\par            7    things we do is a short-term energy outlook
\par 
\par            8    every month now, and twice a year, we look at
\par 
\par            9    a particular seasonal outlook.  Last week,
\par 
\par           10    Margot Anderson's office prepared the winter
\par 
\par           11    fuels outlook, which was released on the 9th,
\par 
\par           12    and that has become another highly
\par 
\par           13    anticipated event.
\par 
\par           14              And this year, we indicated that
\par 
\par           15    with higher prices of both oil and natural
\par 
\par           16    gas, all heating fuel bills were, no matter
\par 
\par           17    where you live or what fuel you use, are
\par 
\par           18    going up somewhat.  And that's kind of a
\par 
\par           19    summary of that.  I won't go into the
\par 
\par           20    details, but I think the main point is that
\par 
\par           21    the advice that this committee has been so
\par 
\par           22    generous in giving us -- how we continue to

\par 
\par            8              We continue to have these products,
\par 
\par            9    both the week, the monthly and the annual
\par 
\par           10    energy outlook, which as I mentioned will be

\par 
\par           13              The other point I wanted to make

\par 
\par           15    committee has worked on with us, and which we
\par 
\par           16    value a great deal in this short-term
\par 
\par           17    outlook, is the regionalization of our
\par 
\par           18    short-term energy model, which, as you know,
\par 
\par           19    has been on the agenda here a number of times
\par 
\par           20    on all fuels, and we've compressed it in the
\par 
\par           21    public release into four regions.

\par 
\par            1    census regions basis, and try to give some
\par 
\par            2    sense of -- depending on which part of the
\par 
\par            3    country you live in or which fuel you use,
\par 
\par            4    what your bill is going to be.  And this year
\par 
\par            5    the big story is heating oil, which is
\par 
\par            6    up -- well, somewhere in the neighborhood,
\par 
\par            7    average of 22 percent, but I think that was
\par 
\par            8    on the assumption that crude oil prices would
\par 
\par            9    be $76.  If they stay anywhere near where
\par 
\par           10    they are now, you can add another 20 cents
\par 
\par           11    per gallon to that heating oil price.
\par 
\par           12              The heating oil prices would be up
\par 
\par           13    40 cents per gallon compared with last year,
\par 
\par           14    but that was, as I mentioned, based on a $76
\par 
\par           15    average crude price.  That leads to a more
\par 
\par           16    than 20 percent increase.  That was the story
\par 
\par           17    this year about the winter fuel outlook.
\par 
\par           18              John Conti's office, which does our
\par 
\par           19    long-term outlook, is working very hard to
\par 
\par           20    meet the expected date of release of the
\par 
\par           21    annual energy outlook in 2008 on

\par 
\par            2    of items within that AEO that have benefited
\par 
\par            3    from your -- this committee's advice, and
\par 
\par            4    continue to upgrade where we can that model,
\par 
\par            5    and as I mentioned, we do have, in that '08
\par 
\par            6    budget, some monies set aside for a redesign
\par 
\par            7    of the AEO, National Energy Model.  But
\par 
\par            8    what's been I guess competing with time in
\par 
\par            9    John's office in the forecasting business has
\par 
\par           10    been a number of reports that we've done for
\par 
\par           11    Congress since our last meeting here.
\par 
\par           12              Some of them, in fact several of
\par 
\par           13    them have been related to climate change.  A
\par 
\par           14    real \ltrpar shift in emphasis, increase in emphasis
\par 
\par           15    on climate issues in this Congress.  And
\par 
\par           16    therefore, they're very interested in knowing
\par 
\par           17    what if we do a cap and trade system at
\par 
\par           18    certain level of restrictions on carbon, and
\par 
\par           19    what if we do a carbon tax.
\par 
\par           20              So we've done several studies, and
\par 
\par           21    I won't go into -- all of this is on our

\par 
\par            5    both from the Congress directly and from
\par

\par

\par           14              I mentioned that there are several
\par

\par 
\par           16    of which is updating a subsidy study that we
\par

\par 
\par           18    Sen. Alexander has asked us to update that,
\par 
\par           19    and that will be out in I think the spring of

\par

\par

\par 
\par           10    he'll go into more detail, but we actually
\par 
\par           11    have done a fair amount of consultation and
\par 
\par           12    cooperation with EPA.  I don't know -- this
\par 
\par           13    is my take on it -- when I got here, there
\par 
\par           14    was pretty -- we were relatively early into
\par 
\par           15    the Bush administration, and we'd just come
\par 
\par           16    out of the Clinton administration, I think
\par 
\par           17    there had been a perception -- at least, if
\par 
\par           18    not a reality -- that there was competing
\par 
\par           19    models, particularly on climate change
\par 
\par           20    issues.
\par 
\par           21              And my sense is that we are a lot
\par 
\par           22    more collaborative now, and that doesn't mean

\par 
\par            1    we always agree and as you know, the models
\par 
\par            2    are different, and we come up with different
\par 
\par            3    conclusions at times.  But I think it's being
\par 
\par            4    done more collegially now.

\par 
\par            6              MR. CONTI:  I'll just say two
\par 
\par            7    words.  In fact, yeah, we've collaborated
\par 
\par            8    with them directly on two studies this year;
\par 
\par            9    Congress has both (inaudible) to do same
\par 
\par           10    analysis.  But we've had a good working
\par 
\par           11    relationships, like Guy says, for at least
\par 
\par           12    five or six years now.  And we've worked with
\par 
\par           13    them on a year-to-year basis.  They usually
\par 
\par           14    use our reference case as a benchmark for a
\par 
\par           15    lot of their analyses.
\par 
\par           16              And so we work with them and we
\par 
\par           17    exchange data.  They have some environment
\par 
\par           18    data that we use on a regular basis.  Of
\par 
\par           19    course, they get a lot of data for all those
\par 
\par           20    working for all\ltrpar  of those (inaudible) electric

\par 
\par            7    Nancy on updates for the coming year.
\par 
\par            8              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Okay.  This is my
\par 
\par            9    chance to go through some of the topics that
\par 
\par           10    we've talked to you about in the past, and to
\par 
\par           11    tell you what progress we have made as a
\par 
\par           12    result.  So I'm just going to go through a
\par 
\par           13    bunch of these; you'll remember them.  These
\par 
\par           14    were all from last spring.
\par 
\par           15              One of them was modeling regional
\par 
\par           16    electricity generation.  There was a lot of
\par 
\par           17    discussion on the Committee about the fact
\par 
\par           18    that you thought that we should use a
\par 
\par           19    cumulative distribution function instead
\par 
\par           20    of bin numbers.
\par 
\par           21              And we actually didn't do much with
\par 
\par           22    that recently -- because he had used a

\par            1    cumulative distribution function in earlier
\par 
\par            2    work, and he then found that the bin number
\par 
\par            3    approach gave him better results.
\par 
\par            4              If you think about what the bin
\par 
\par            5    numbers are, they're basically a (inaudible)
\par 
\par            6    version of the CDF.  So it's not a totally
\par 
\par            7    different approach, it just sounds different
\par 
\par            8    when you call them bin numbers.
\par 
\par            9              If you'd like to see what you can
\par 
\par           10    do with the model, Philip has a paper that he
\par 
\par           11    gave at a conference this year, and that's
\par 
\par           12    available at Tab 12 in your book.  The
\par 
\par           13    regional STEO hasn't really started using it.
\par 
\par           14    They need a little bit more time to evaluate
\par 
\par           15    it and work with it, figure out how to fit it
\par 
\par           16    into their framework.  And they're also still
\par 
\par           17    a little bit concerned about fuel switching.
\par 
\par           18              Howard Bradsher-Fredrick talked to
\par 
\par           19    you about petroleum imports data, and you
\par 
\par           20    recommended that we meet with the Census
\par 
\par           21    Bureau to talk about the differences in the
\par 
\par           22    definitions between their forms, which are

\par 
\par 
\par            1    basically the Customs forms and definitions,
\par 
\par            2    and our survey definitions, and also
\par 
\par            3    recommended interviewing respondents to find
\par 
\par            4    out why they report different things on the
\par 
\par            5    two surveys.
\par 
\par            6              We did meet with the Census Bureau
\par 
\par            7    in June, and this increased our understanding
\par 
\par            8    about what they do, and also the fact that
\par 
\par            9    we're probably not going to have much impact
\par 
\par           10    on their definitions.  So these definitional
\par 
\par           11    issues are going to remain.  But at least
\par 
\par           12    there's a contact person that we can talk to
\par 
\par           13    when we think that there is misclassification
\par 
\par           14    on their side or our side.  So at least we
\par 
\par           15    can have communication and help to resolve
\par 
\par           16    some differences.
\par 
\par           17              Howard just developed a protocol
\par 
\par           18    for conducting interviews with a small sample
\par 
\par           19    of respondents -- our import surveys.  We
\par 
\par           20    haven't done much with it, primarily because
\par 
\par           21    the staff at Oil and Gas is too busy to worry
\par 
\par           22    about it right now.  However, we plan to do

\par 
\par            2    have heard a lot about it over the last few
\par 
\par            3    meetings, and the forms clearance package has
\par 
\par            4    now gone to OMB for approval.
\par 
\par            5              Bob (?) talked to you about forms
\par 
\par            6    testing, and recommended a combination of
\par 
\par            7    field work, field testing and cognitive
\par 
\par            8    testing.  And we have acted on that
\par 
\par            9    suggestion.  They did a pretest this summer
\par 
\par           10    with three companies, and they found there
\par 
\par           11    were some problems in the form, and they have
\par 
\par           12    hopefully solved those problems.  There's
\par 
\par           13    going to be a full test later this fall.  And
\par 
\par           14    you will hear more about Electricity 2008.
\par 
\par           15    Joel Douglas is going to describe the
\par 
\par           16    sampling plan for the new Form 923, at 3:15
\par 
\par           17    this afternoon in room 5E-069.
\par 
\par           18              And we talked to you about out
\par 
\par           19    proposal for a student grants program for
\par 
\par           20    applied research.  We've been a little bit
\par 
\par           21    slow about this; we hope to have the
\par 
\par           22    proposals posted on the NISS website soon.  I

\par            1    just sent them around to office directors to

\par 
\par            3    In fact, I'd like to do it next week, but
\par 
\par            4    we'll see.  These things always take more
\par 
\par            5    time than you think they should.  The
\par 
\par            6    Committee suggested looking at some similar
\par 
\par            7    fellowship programs, in particular the EPA
\par 
\par            8    STAR program.
\par 
\par            9              Ruey-Pyng did look at all of these
\par 
\par           10    references.  He felt that the EPA STAR
\par 
\par           11    program -- one of its strengths is it has
\par 
\par           12    great guidance and frequently asked questions
\par 
\par           13    on its website.  So we're going to look at
\par 
\par           14    those and try to make sure we have good
\par 
\par           15    information posted on our website, in the
\par 
\par           16    NISS website.
\par 
\par           17              Looked at MITACS, and said that
\par 
\par           18    they thought it was similar to NISS, and the
\par 
\par           19    other one was not quite as related to EIA.
\par 
\par           20              But at least we now have a model
\par 
\par           21    that we could use to make sure that our
\par 
\par           22    material is better.  The other thing that's

\par 
\par 
\par            1    related to the NISS activity is that we are
\par 
\par            2    going to have a separate announcement for
\par 
\par            3    research or access to microdata.  So people
\par 
\par            4    will be able to apply through the NISS
\par 
\par            5    fellowship program to get access to
\par 
\par            6    microdata.  And the plan is that the
\par 
\par            7    proposals would be reviewed first at NISS and
\par 
\par            8    then within EIA, and evaluated on a range of
\par 
\par            9    things, including how sensitive the data are
\par 
\par           10    and the resources required of EIA, since this
\par 
\par           11    is going to be only onsite research of EIA.
\par 
\par           12              We're also going to initiate a new
\par 
\par           13    project with EMEU to see about what we'd have
\par 
\par           14    to do and whether we want to use the
\par 
\par           15    microdata enclave program.

\par 
\par           18    few times, and he's also on the agenda for
\par

\par 
\par           20    more about him.

\par            1    variables and how they're changed, and he

\par 
\par            3    I think after the meeting, Derek did provide
\par 
\par            4    George some more input, and so they are
\par 
\par            5    actually using a latin hypercube design now

\par            7    about it tomorrow.  Then finally, we have a
\par 
\par            8    workshop that Andy Kitese has -- and I have
\par 
\par            9    worked together -- to establish a workshop on
\par 
\par           10    decision making and energy markets.
\par 
\par           11              There is a description of it at
\par 
\par           12    Tab 12 in your book.  It's going to be on
\par 
\par           13    December 11th in this building.  There is
\par 
\par           14    limited space, but if it is something you are
\par 
\par           15    interested in, you should call Andy to see if
\par 
\par           16    you could come.  I think he has made
\par 
\par           17    arrangements for a slightly bigger room.  So
\par 
\par           18    it is not quite as limited as we thought it
\par 
\par           19    would be at the beginning.
\par 
\par           20              And that's all that I have.  Does
\par 
\par           21    anybody have any questions?
\par 
\par           22              Neha?

\par            1              MS. KHANNA:  Yes, the scholarship
\par 
\par            2    program that you mentioned -- I don't recall,
\par 
\par            3    is it open to students who are foreign
\par 
\par            4    nationals?
\par 
\par            5              MS. KIRKENDALL:  The fellowship
\par 
\par            6    piece of it is.  Because you can -- there is
\par 
\par            7    things that can be done -- the place we have
\par 
\par            8    a problem is of foreign nationals coming into
\par 
\par            9    this building, as you all have noticed.
\par 
\par           10    However, we can give grants to students of
\par 
\par           11    any nationality if the work can be done at
\par 
\par           12    their institution, possibly with meetings
\par 
\par           13    here.
\par 
\par           14              The onsite research program will be
\par 
\par           15    only for citizens, because we just can't deal
\par 
\par           16    with the security issues.  Anything else?
\par 
\par           17              Actually on the NISS fellowship
\par 
\par           18    program, I would hope that your students
\par 
\par           19    would be good candidates for it, because you
\par 
\par           20    people know our issues better than almost
\par 
\par           21    anybody in academia.  So that's a hope.
\par

\par            1    a couple of retiring -- couple of Committee
\par 
\par            2    members who are on their last meeting.  So I
\par 
\par            3    think it's our tradition -- the Committee
\par 
\par            4    tradition is to recognize them for the
\par 
\par            5    distinguished service they have provided.
\par 
\par            6              So --
\par 
\par            7              MR. CARUSO:  We've already
\par 
\par            8    mentioned how much we appreciate -- how much
\par 
\par            9    we -- during my time here, I guess, but more
\par 
\par           10    or less coincides with your -- is it six
\par 
\par           11    years?
\par 
\par           12              MS. KHANNA:  Yes.
\par 
\par           13              MR. CARUSO:  Perfect, and thank you
\par 
\par           14    very much for your comments, for your
\par 
\par           15    diligence and everything you have done here.
\par 
\par           16    So thank you very much.  Here is a little

\par 
\par           18              MS. KHANNA:  Well, thank you.
\par 
\par           19              MR. CARUSO:  I guess it's more than
\par 
\par           20    a confirmed rumor now, because this one's for
\par 
\par           21    Bill Weinig.

\par 
\par            5    for that and many other things you do for us
\par 
\par            6    here at EIA, I want to really give you this
\par 
\par            7    as appreciation of that.  And the other thing
\par 
\par            8    I wanted to mention about Bill is that not
\par 
\par            9    only have you all benefited from his good
\par 
\par           10    work, but Bill, about six months ago, or at
\par 
\par           11    least six months ago, started to mentor
\par 
\par           12    Alicia (?), and the transition from being
\par 
\par           13    liaison to this committee and other work has
\par 
\par           14    I believe gone very smoothly, and I think
\par 
\par           15    that the meetings have demonstrated that.
\par 
\par           16              So I want to also acknowledge you
\par 
\par           17    for being a good mentor, being someone who
\par 
\par           18    recognizes how important it is for us at EIA
\par 
\par           19    as the demographics continue to change our
\par 
\par           20    faces around here.
\par 
\par           21              So Bill, thanks very much,
\par 
\par           22    appreciate it.

\par 
\par            1    Columbia.  And some of you have -- I think
\par 
\par            2    the Committee members have been already
\par 
\par            3    notified, he recently went on a kayaking trip
\par 
\par            4    and did not return when he was supposed to
\par 
\par            5    return home.  And then when they sent out
\par 
\par            6    search crew and so on, actually they didn't
\par 
\par            7    find him.
\par 
\par            8              So in fact, his whereabouts are
\par 
\par            9    actually unknown, because they have abandoned
\par 
\par           10    the search because they found his life jacket
\par 
\par           11    and personal items.  So it's a really sad
\par 
\par           12    event, because Randy, those of you who know
\par 
\par           13    him, was a really terrific individual;
\par 
\par           14    brilliant.  I think one of the rare people
\par 
\par           15    who really understands the problems in the
\par 
\par           16    government, I think has come and work in my
\par 
\par           17    staff regularly.
\par 
\par           18              People in my staff know him very
\par 
\par           19    well.  And tremendous loss to the statistics
\par 
\par           20    community as a whole.  So I think we have
\par 
\par           21    benefited from the relationships and his
\par 
\par           22    involvement with the Committee, and we're

\par 
\par 
\par            1    very sorry to hear that news.
\par 
\par            2              I think, even though the search was
\par 
\par            3    abandoned, I think we're sure that wherever
\par 
\par            4    he is, we should hope that he is very
\par 
\par            5    peaceful.
\par 
\par            6              So Moshe, who was closely involved
\par 
\par            7    with Randy, I'm now going to ask Moshe to
\par 
\par            8    make a few remarks about Randy's career and
\par 
\par            9    his life.
\par 
\par           10              MR. FEDER:  It's indeed very hard
\par 
\par           11    for me to talk about Randy who was a
\par 
\par           12    remarkable person in many ways -- personally
\par 
\par           13    as a person, as a mentor, as a scientist, as
\par 
\par           14    a teacher, and as a member of this committee,
\par 
\par           15    Randy and I crossed paths twice in our life.
\par 
\par           16    First when I made a switch to statistics,
\par 
\par           17    working for Stats Canada; I went to Compton
\par 
\par           18    University to get a master's degree, that's
\par 
\par           19    after I had most of my life done pure
\par 
\par           20    mathematics, and Randy was my advisor.
\par 
\par           21              And in one of those twists of
\par 
\par           22    fate -- Randy and I were both members of this

\par 
\par 
\par            1    committee.  I think Randy's unique sense of
\par 
\par            2    humor, great personal relationships, was
\par 
\par            3    something that many of us evidenced, and it's
\par 
\par            4    indeed a very tragic loss.  Randy made
\par 
\par            5    contributions to our science in two important
\par 
\par            6    areas.  One was survey sampling, where he
\par 
\par            7    collaborated with Jeff Woo, with John Rowe,
\par 
\par            8    and others, and then he also worked in
\par 
\par            9    quality improvement and rose to the
\par 
\par           10    editorship of Technometrics, which as you
\par 
\par           11    know is one of the very top statistical
\par 
\par           12    journals.
\par 
\par           13              As Nagaraj mentioned, four weeks
\par 
\par           14    ago, on Wednesday, he went on that kayak trip
\par 
\par           15    from which he never returned, and when the
\par 
\par           16    news started spreading around, many of us, it
\par 
\par           17    came as a great shock to us.  Randy was only
\par 
\par           18    46 and already accomplished so much in his
\par 
\par           19    life.
\par 
\par           20              Maybe in one of the future meetings
\par 
\par           21    we can have a session where we can discuss
\par 
\par           22    his work.  I think he touched things that are

\par 
\par 
\par            1    important to EIA in both areas of his
\par 
\par            2    interest.
\par 
\par            3              He was a mentor to many, myself,
\par 
\par            4    included -- despite the many years I'm older
\par 
\par            5    than him, and to another member of this
\par 
\par            6    committee, Derek, who is not here at this
\par 
\par            7    time, maybe next time he can also mention a
\par 
\par            8    few things.  So again, very remarkable
\par 
\par            9    person.
\par 
\par           10              I'll just mention one comment that
\par 
\par           11    once when I joined this committee, it's
\par 
\par           12    something about Randy's casual style.  And I
\par 
\par           13    contacted Bill Weinig, and I said what's the
\par 
\par           14    dress code for this?  And he said -- he said
\par 
\par           15    you'll be comfortable in a jacket and a tie,
\par 
\par           16 \ltrpar    but there's also Randy Sictor.
\par 
\par           17              Randy was -- one of the recent
\par 
\par           18    meetings -- Randy, as you know, is Canadian.
\par 
\par           19    He said at the risk of sounding unpatriotic,
\par 
\par           20    and then he went on to make a comment -- of
\par 
\par           21    course, we knew that actually he was not a
\par 
\par           22    citizen -- a very unique person and a great

\par 
\par            5    to us about the Annual Energy Conference, the
\par 
\par            6    30th anniversary.
\par 
\par            7              MS. ANDERSON:  Randy is a tough act
\par 
\par            8    to follow.  Let me give you a little bit
\par 
\par            9    about what we're going to do in 2008.  As Guy
\par 
\par           10    mentioned about the conference -- I won't
\par 
\par           11    take up much of your time.
\par 
\par           12              Next slide, please?  I'm Margot
\par 
\par           13    Anderson, and I'm the director of the
\par 
\par           14              Energy Markets End Use office here
\par 
\par           15    in EIA, and I've been asked to be the Chair
\par 
\par           16    of this committee.  It takes a village; we
\par 
\par           17    have representatives from every one of our
\par 
\par           18    offices who are contributing to this event in
\par 
\par           19    2008, and what we're going to do in 2008 is
\par 
\par           20    have an energy conference, and we're going to
\par 
\par           21    call it "30 Years of Energy Information and
\par

\par            1              It's April 7 and 8, as Guy
\par 
\par            2    mentioned in his slide -- at the D.C.
\par 
\par            3    Convention Center.
\par 
\par            4              We've got multiple purposes this
\par 
\par            5    year, because we want to commemorate our
\par 
\par            6    anniversary and provide a forum for
\par 
\par            7    discussing a lot of what we do in EIA -- data
\par 
\par            8    collection and analysis and forecasting, and
\par 
\par            9    we want to cover a wide range of energy
\par 
\par           10    issues.
\par 
\par           11              In 2008, we're expanding from our
\par 
\par           12    usual one-day Data and Outlook Conference.
\par 
\par           13    I'm sure many of you have attended this over
\par 
\par           14    the years, and this year because it's our
\par 
\par           15    30th anniversary, we wanted to do something
\par 
\par           16    that was more expansive, hence the two days,
\par 
\par           17    hence the Convention Center, hence the room
\par 
\par           18    for more people to come.  And we're going to
\par 
\par           19    cover a variety of topics.
\par 
\par           20              In the past few months, we've
\par 
\par           21    mostly looked at forecasting issues and some
\par 
\par           22    data issues.  And if you'll see the next

\par            1    slide, these are some of the sessions that
\par 
\par            2    we're going to cover.
\par 
\par            3              We're going to combine this with
\par 
\par            4    our summer fuels outlook.  We normally do
\par 
\par            5    that in early April anyway, and we thought
\par 
\par            6    that this would be a great combination and
\par 
\par            7    would be a good draw.
\par 
\par            8              We'll certainly cover the annual
\par 
\par            9    energy outlook at a session, and it will be
\par 
\par           10    in this first and several other sessions as
\par 
\par           11    well.  We're going to do one on peak oil.
\par 
\par           12    We're going to do one on natural gas data.
\par 
\par           13              As you can see, we've got a good
\par 
\par           14    mixture of sessions that are dealing with our
\par 
\par           15    own internal programs, our data programs, and
\par 
\par           16    our analytic programs, to get some feedback
\par 
\par           17    on what we're doing in terms of data
\par 
\par           18    collection and analysis.  And we're also
\par 
\par           19    having other sessions that are more topical
\par 
\par           20    that will reflect a lot of the work that we
\par 
\par           21    do in a day-in and day-out basis.

\par 
\par            2    office has been doing any number of service
\par 
\par            3    reports in this area, and here is a way to
\par 
\par            4    tell folks what we've been doing on this and
\par 
\par            5    to generate a discussion about renewable
\par 
\par            6    portfolio standards.
\par 
\par            7              This is not the entire list, but it
\par 
\par            8    is a range of the kinds of things we're
\par 
\par            9    looking at.  We're hoping to get all of the
\par 
\par           10    previous EIA administrators to come to the
\par 
\par           11    conference and have a roundtable discussion
\par 
\par           12    with them about their experiences, and we
\par 
\par           13    hope Guy will lead that conversation.  We
\par 
\par           14    think that will be a really good session.
\par 
\par           15              We're hoping to bring in some
\par 
\par           16    senior staff from the Hill to talk to us
\par 
\par           17    about climate and energy legislation, what's
\par 
\par           18    next, and we think that will be a very
\par 
\par           19    exciting session.
\par 
\par           20              So this is a jampacked two days,
\par 
\par           21    but this is where we're going.  It's my
\par 
\par           22    understanding that this committee is

\par 
\par            1    considering scheduling its event maybe before
\par 
\par            2    or after this conference, so there would be
\par 
\par            3    an opportunity for all of you to be a part of
\par 
\par            4    this.
\par 
\par            5              As I said, any number of the
\par 
\par            6    sessions, about six of them, are really
\par 
\par            7    related to what we're doing internally, our
\par 
\par            8    internal business associated with our data
\par 
\par            9    programs and our analytic programs, and I
\par 
\par           10    think that'll be a good opportunity for some
\par 
\par           11    interaction -- to get commentary and input
\par 
\par           12    from people that use our stuff, people who
\par 
\par           13    compete with us, and there will be sessions
\par 
\par           14    that are more about -- program review-type
\par 
\par           15    sessions.
\par 
\par           16              In typical EIA style, we don't
\par 
\par           17    charge for this conference.  It's free to the
\par 
\par           18    public.  We explored different ways to charge
\par 
\par           19    folks, but we were unable to do so.  There
\par 
\par           20    have been some new directives from the
\par 
\par           21    Department of Energy that create hurdles for
\par 
\par           22    charging, so it will be free, and we're

\par 
\par           11    Any questions?
\par 
\par           12              Yes, John?
\par 
\par           13              MR. WEYANT:  So the dates are now
\par 
\par           14    fixed in stone?
\par 
\par           15              MS. ANDERSON:  The dates are now
\par 
\par           16    fixed in stone.  The contract is all but
\par 
\par           17    signed.  7th and 8th.  The 8th is the release
\par 
\par           18    of the summer fuels outlook, but it is the
\par 
\par           19    7th and 8th.  Hope you don't have a conflict.
\par 
\par           20              MR. WEYANT:  No, I'm trying to
\par

\par            7    on developing key energy indicators.
\par 
\par            8              MS. LENT:  Hi.  My name is Janice
\par 
\par            9    Lent.  I'm one of the newer people here at
\par 
\par           10    EIA.  I am in Nancy's group, the Statistics
\par 
\par           11    and Methods Division.  I started in January.
\par 
\par           12    Many of you don't know me, but your
\par 
\par           13    COMCON (?) representative, Al Toopak (?), the
\par 
\par           14    representative for this committee, is a
\par 
\par           15    friend of mine, my first supervisor when I
\par 
\par           16    started work at BLS.  That was back when
\par 
\par           17    there were dinosaurs roaming around at BLS of
\par 
\par           18    course.  IBM XTs and things like that.
\par 
\par           19              But I wanted to speak today about a
\par 
\par           20    new initiative that has started here at EIA.
\par 
\par           21              There's a group of eight people
\par 
\par           22    who've been working on it since this past

\par            1    summer, since about July, and the initiative
\par 
\par            2    is developing key energy indicators.  I'll be
\par 
\par            3    giving the first part of this talk, and my
\par 
\par            4    colleague Joe Conklin from the Office of Oil
\par 
\par            5    and Gas will give the second part.
\par 
\par            6              So first of all, the motivation for
\par 
\par            7    this project.  One of the things I wanted to
\par 
\par            8    do with this project was to make the big
\par 
\par            9    picture of the energy situation more easily
\par 
\par           10    accessible to our users.  The idea is that
\par 
\par           11    the key energy indicators would be presented
\par 
\par           12    on the EIA website together in a place that
\par 
\par           13    was easily accessible.
\par 
\par           14              That could be the homepage, or it
\par 
\par           15    could be somewhere else, that hasn't been
\par 
\par           16    decided, but these indicators should in a
\par 
\par           17    short space, in a compact space, tell people
\par 
\par           18    the big picture of the energy situation.
\par 
\par           19              Also, we wanted to be able to
\par 
\par           20    highlight important changes in the U.S.
\par 
\par           21    energy situation.  In particular, things like
\par 
\par           22    the fuel mix have been fairly static over the

\par 
\par 
\par            1    past several decades -- petroleum has been
\par 
\par            2    dominant, but a lot of research and a lot of
\par 
\par            3    money is being poured into research that's
\par 
\par            4    geared towards changing that situation.
\par 
\par            5              So we feel that eventually, we
\par 
\par            6    don't know when it's going to happen, but
\par 
\par            7    things will start to change, and with this
\par 
\par            8    set of indicators, EIA will be already set up
\par 
\par            9    to tell that story in numbers in a way that
\par 
\par           10    is easily accessible, in a format that is
\par 
\par           11    easy to understand.
\par 
\par           12              We also want to provide faster
\par 
\par           13    access to some of EIA's most broadly relevant
\par 
\par           14    products, and kind of showcase some of the
\par 
\par           15    good things that EIA is doing, and also to
\par 
\par           16    answer the simple questions upfront.  A user
\par 
\par           17    coming to the EIA website might have very
\par 
\par           18    simple questions, like how much energy do we
\par 
\par           19    use, where does it come from, and how much
\par 
\par           20    does it cost.
\par 
\par           21              Now, actually, the EIA website does
\par 
\par           22    have simple answers to this simple question,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    but it's not always that simple to find them.
\par 
\par            2    So for example -- how can I do this?  Okay,
\par 
\par            3    is there a mouse here?  Okay.  I wanted to
\par 
\par            4    look at the EIA website.
\par 
\par            5              So this is the home page.  You can
\par 
\par            6    see a couple of indicators here under "latest
\par 
\par            7    data," the crude spot price and the retail
\par 
\par            8    gasoline price.  This project partly is aimed
\par 
\par            9    toward expanding that list, presenting them
\par 
\par           10    perhaps in a way that would be easier to
\par 
\par           11    understand, perhaps in a graphical form.  So
\par 
\par           12    to answer the simple questions upfront is one
\par 
\par           13    of the goals of the project.
\par 
\par           14              I'm sorry; I didn't realize that
\par 
\par           15    this was going to be this hard.
\par 
\par           16              This is the basic outline of the
\par 
\par           17    talk that Joe and I will be giving.  First,
\par 
\par           18    we're going to go over some background.  The
\par 
\par           19    growing popularity of indicator collections.
\par 
\par           20              We'll talk about some of the other
\par 
\par           21    indicator collections that are available.
\par 
\par           22    We'll talk about some indicator collections

\par 
\par 
\par            1    that are presented by other statistical
\par 
\par            2    agencies.  I was going to go through some
\par 
\par \ltrpar            3    examples, but with the technical set-up here,
\par 
\par            4    it might be a little difficult to do that.
\par 
\par            5    So maybe we'll look at just one example.
\par 
\par            6              We'll talk about the parameters of
\par 
\par            7    our project, what exactly we set out to do;
\par 
\par            8    some of the issues that we faced in selecting
\par 
\par            9    key energy indicators; and then probably the
\par 
\par           10    most interesting part -- Joe Conklin will
\par 
\par           11    talk about the key energy indicators that we
\par 
\par           12    selected as a preliminary list.
\par 
\par           13              He'll go through the list.
\par 
\par           14              First of all, the popularity of
\par 
\par           15    indicator sets is growing.  Some of you might
\par 
\par           16    be familiar with the State of the USA website
\par 
\par           17    that's being developed.  This is a website
\par 
\par           18    that focuses on 30 key national indicators.
\par 
\par           19    It's a project that grew out of an initiative
\par 
\par           20    that was spearheaded by the National Academy
\par 
\par           21    of Science.
\par 
\par           22              And the 30 indicators are things

\par            1    like the unemployment rate and the GDP, other

\par            2    national indicators.
\par 
\par            3              It's supposed to sort of sum up the
\par 
\par            4    state of the USA in a collection of
\par 
\par            5    indicators.  Also, international
\par 
\par            6    organizations have for decades put out
\par 
\par            7    indicator sets, both for international
\par 
\par            8    comparisons and for monitoring the
\par

\par           11              The United Nations Statistics
\par 
\par           12    Division actually puts out an energy yearbook
\par 
\par           13    which is packed with energy statistics from a
\par 
\par           14    number of countries.  The Organization for
\par 
\par           15    Economic Cooperation and Development puts out
\par 
\par           16    energy statistics along with other statistics
\par 
\par           17    for its member countries; also the
\par 
\par           18    International Atomic Energy Association and
\par 
\par           19    the European Union.  A lot of these are
\par 
\par           20    focused on internationally harmonized systems
\par 
\par           21    of indicators.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    that for our indicator set.  We didn't insist
\par 
\par            2    that we select indicators that would be
\par 
\par            3    comparable across countries.
\par 
\par            4              Some energy indicator collections
\par 
\par            5    are also available on the web already.  For
\par 
\par            6    example, the International Energy Agency puts
\par 
\par            7    out a large list of petroleum indicators that
\par 
\par            8    they've developed, and they even put out a
\par 
\par            9    book recently -- a full book of energy
\par 
\par           10    indicators.
\par 
\par           11              So the point is that indicator
\par 
\par           12    collections are becoming very chic and
\par 
\par           13    fashionable these days.  We didn't take on
\par 
\par           14    this project so that EIA could be chic and
\par 
\par           15    fashionable -- that wasn't the reason,
\par 
\par           16    although that might be a by-product of it.
\par 
\par           17    Another by-product might be that we could do
\par 
\par           18    a slightly better job of keeping up with the
\par 
\par           19    Joneses, as they say.
\par 
\par           20              When we were developing these
\par 
\par           21    indicators, we looked at these indicator sets

\par 
\par 
\par            1    also looked at indicator collections that
\par 
\par            2    other statistical agencies had on their web
\par 
\par            3    pages.  So we looked at a number of different
\par 
\par            4    examples.  And I wanted to show you -- well,
\par 
\par            5    I was going to show three examples, but let
\par 
\par            6    me just show you one.
\par 
\par            7              Go to the BLS website.  So if you
\par 
\par            8    go to the BLS website, you see that they have
\par 
\par            9    latest numbers here -- the CPI, the
\par 
\par           10    unemployment rate, payroll employment, and
\par 
\par           11    they're giving the change over time for each
\par 
\par           12    one.  So that's one example.  I'll just talk
\par 
\par           13    through the other examples for the sake of
\par 
\par           14    time.
\par 
\par           15              The Census Bureau also has a set of
\par 
\par           16    key indicators on its website.  It's a
\par 
\par           17    dropdown list, and they have 14 different
\par 
\par           18    economic indicators there.  Also, the Bureau
\par 
\par           19    of Transportation Statistics, which is a much
\par 
\par           20    smaller agency, has some key indexes on its
\par 
\par           21    home page.  It presents them in a graphical
\par 
\par           22    form; it has their transportation services

\par 
\par 
\par            1    index, and they have their air travel price
\par 
\par            2    index, and they have the latest numbers in
\par 
\par            3    the graph on the home page.
\par 
\par            4              So these are three different
\par 
\par            5    examples.  You can look at them at your
\par 
\par            6    leisure, but we looked at the similarities
\par 
\par            7    and the differences between them.
\par 
\par            8              All of them present their most
\par 
\par            9    current data.  They're presented at the
\par 
\par           10    highest level of aggregation, and then you
\par 
\par           11    can click on things to get down to lower
\par 
\par           12    levels of aggregation, to get down to the
\par 
\par           13    historical series and to get down to
\par 
\par           14    metadata, an explanation of the indicators.
\par 
\par           15              So that was something that our
\par 
\par           16    group considered doing, setting it up with
\par 
\par           17    drilldown capabilities.  In these three cases
\par 
\par           18    of these other agencies, all of the
\par 
\par           19    indicators that they have on their home page
\par 
\par           20    are products of those agencies, and that was
\par 
\par           21    another question that we considered: should
\par 
\par           22    our indicator set be just EIA products or

\par 
\par 
\par            1    should it include others?
\par 
\par            2              The displays of these indicator
\par 
\par            3    sets varies from agency to agency.  We've
\par 
\par            4    looked at the BLS site, which just has the
\par 
\par            5    numbers themselves.  Census Bureau has a
\par 
\par            6    dropdown box, a dropdown list that will take
\par 
\par            7    you to an individual indicator, or it will
\par 
\par            8    take you to metadata on those indicators.
\par 
\par            9    BTS\ltrpar  displays theirs graphically.
\par 
\par           10              So there are different ways of
\par 
\par           11    displaying the indicator sets, and that's
\par 
\par           12    another topic that our group has been
\par 
\par           13    considering.  Although we don't have
\par 
\par           14    decisions, we'd like to get some input from
\par 
\par           15    the Committee on things like presentation and
\par 
\par           16    metadata.
\par 
\par           17              So the size of the indicator
\par 
\par           18    collections also seems to vary.  It's more a
\par 
\par           19    function of the agency in those three cases,
\par 
\par           20    but the size of our collection we thought
\par 
\par           21    should be probably around a dozen, although
\par 
\par           22    we really wanted to be flexible about that.

\par 
\par 
\par            1              So essentially, we have a group
\par 
\par            2    that was chartered, the Key Energy Indicator
\par 
\par            3    Subgroup -- KEIS -- was charted by the
\par 
\par            4    Interoffice Issues Group here at EIA.  And we
\par 
\par            5    were given some parameters for the project.
\par 
\par            6              In particular, we had a target
\par 
\par            7    audience that was not -- probably not the
\par 
\par            8    typical EIA data users.  We wanted to target
\par 
\par            9    policymakers who wanted the big picture
\par 
\par           10    quickly, the media, and the interested
\par 
\par           11    public.  A lot of EIA data users are energy
\par 
\par           12    analysts, or they are experts in the energy
\par 
\par           13    industry.
\par 
\par           14              With this set, we're targeting
\par 
\par           15    people who are not in that category.  And
\par 
\par           16    maybe I need to say something about the
\par 
\par           17    interested public that might not be so clear,
\par 
\par           18    but the Census Bureau estimates now that over
\par 
\par           19    57 million adults in the U.S. have a
\par 
\par           20    bachelor's degree or higher.
\par 
\par           21              This is a higher percentage than
\par 
\par           22    it's ever been in the past, and in

\par 
\par 
\par            1    particular, the younger generation is much
\par 
\par            2    more comfortable with quantitative
\par 
\par            3    information than previous generations have
\par 
\par            4    been.  So to try to engage that audience and
\par 
\par            5    try to help them become better informed about
\par 
\par            6    the energy situation in the country, we felt
\par 
\par            7    that this indicator collection would help.
\par 
\par            8              The characteristics of the
\par 
\par            9    indicators -- we felt they should be
\par 
\par           10    current -- we didn't want something up there
\par 
\par           11    that was two or three years old.  For this,
\par 
\par           12    even though EIA focuses a lot on forecasts,
\par 
\par           13    we wanted these indicators to be data-based,
\par 
\par           14    so that people would not confuse database
\par 
\par           15    numbers with numbers that were dependent on
\par 
\par           16    model assumptions.  But we wanted them to be
\par 
\par           17    broadly focused, so covering a number of
\par 
\par           18    areas -- economics, energy supply -- we'll go
\par 
\par           19    through the list of categories that we have.
\par 
\par           20              The Key Energy Indicator Subgroup
\par 
\par           21    consisted of representatives from a number of
\par 
\par           22    different offices.  We have three

\par 
\par 
\par            1    representatives from the Office of Oil and
\par 
\par            2    Gas, two from the Office of Coal, Nuclear
\par 
\par            3    Energy, Electricity and Alternative Fuels,
\par 
\par            4    and we had one representative from each of
\par 
\par            5    the other offices you see here.  So all of
\par 
\par            6    these offices within EIA participated
\par 
\par            7    actively in this project.
\par 
\par            8              What we did when the group got
\par 
\par            9    together -- and we got representatives from
\par 
\par           10    different offices within EIA, we first drew
\par 
\par           11    up a long list of energy indicators -- pretty
\par 
\par           12    much anything that anybody thought might be a
\par 
\par           13    good energy indicator, we put on a long list,
\par 
\par           14    and that turned out to the easy part of the
\par 
\par           15    process.  The hard part was taking that long
\par 
\par           16    list and narrowing it down to something that
\par 
\par           17    was more like 12 to 15 indicators.  Some of
\par 
\par           18    the numbers on that list -- some of the
\par 
\par           19    indicators existed already.
\par 
\par           20              Some of them were things that we
\par 
\par           21    wanted to have existing in the future, and
\par 
\par           22    some of them were things that sort of

\par 
\par 
\par            1    existed, but they needed to be tweaked in
\par 
\par            2    some way in order to meet the criterion that
\par 
\par            3    we had set out.
\par 
\par            4              In narrowing down that list, the
\par 
\par            5    group ended up discussing a lot of issues
\par 
\par            6    related to energy indicators.  And I wanted
\par 
\par            7    to just talk about a few of these issues,
\par 
\par            8    because these issues relate to some of the
\par 
\par            9    questions that we would like to get feedback
\par 
\par           10    on from the Committee.
\par 
\par           11              So I'm holding you in suspense, I
\par 
\par           12    know, not telling you what indicators we
\par 
\par           13    selected, and Joe is going to do that in just
\par 
\par           14    a minute, but I thought it might help to sort
\par 
\par           15    of put the questions that we're asking in
\par 
\par           16    context.
\par 
\par           17              Some of the issues that we
\par 
\par           18    faced -- we noticed for example that the
\par 
\par           19    other statistical agencies were putting up
\par 
\par           20    just their own products.  That was a
\par 
\par           21    question -- should we follow that example or
\par 
\par           22    not?  Should we just limit this to EIA

\par 
\par 
\par            1    products -- there were some wholesale energy
\par 
\par            2    market prices, for example, that were not EIA
\par 
\par            3    products, but that we thought might be
\par 
\par            4    included.
\par 
\par            5              Also, the inclusion of principal
\par 
\par            6    economic indicators, should they be included
\par 
\par            7    automatically?  I talked about the fact that
\par 
\par            8    we do have one principal economic indicator
\par 
\par            9    now that's produced by EIA.  We may have more
\par 
\par           10    in the future; hopefully, we will, and that's
\par 
\par           11    another issue.
\par 
\par           12              A lot of our discussion focused on
\par 
\par           13    the frequency -- like we put out data, in
\par 
\par           14    many cases, monthly, annually, or quarterly,
\par 
\par           15    a\ltrpar t different aggregation levels -- national,
\par 
\par           16    regional, et cetera.  And we wanted to set it
\par 
\par           17    up so that a certain set of indicators would
\par 
\par           18    be upfront, and then you would be able to
\par 
\par           19    click and drill down to other levels of
\par 
\par           20    aggregation and other frequencies.
\par 
\par           21              And so which ones should be upfront
\par

\par 
\par            1    some about usability testing and the metadata
\par 
\par            2    that would be presented with the indicators,
\par 
\par            3    although this particular group focused mainly
\par 
\par            4    on the content of the indicators, not on the
\par 
\par            5    metadata.
\par 
\par            6              So first of all, wholesale energy
\par 
\par            7    market prices -- when we drew up this long
\par 
\par            8    list of indicators, some of the things that
\par 
\par            9    came up -- and they were very popular, came
\par 
\par           10    up with a lot of the group members -- were
\par 
\par           11    things like the WTI, the West Texas
\par 
\par           12    Intermediate spot price, and the Henry Hub
\par 
\par           13    natural gas spot price, and these we felt
\par 
\par           14    were very important, though they are not EIA
\par 
\par           15    products.
\par 
\par           16              So where we came down on this, and
\par 
\par           17    we're open to comment on this, is that we
\par 
\par           18    felt customers who really want these prices
\par 
\par           19    usually go to the trade websites, and their
\par 
\par           20    significance is not really obvious to our
\par 
\par           21    target audience -- that 57 million educated
\par 
\par           22    people who might want to get some energy

\par 
\par 
\par            1    information quickly -- we felt that these in
\par 
\par            2    general should not be included, although we
\par 
\par            3    wanted to include the crude oil price, the
\par 
\par            4    West Texas Intermediate spot price, because
\par 
\par            5    we felt the list of energy indicators just
\par 
\par            6    might seem incomplete without this crude oil
\par 
\par            7    price, which has such a large impact on the
\par 
\par            8    energy markets.
\par 
\par            9              So that was one issue.  Another
\par 
\par           10    issue we faced was the Principal Economic
\par 
\par           11    Indicators.  I don't know if everybody in the
\par 
\par           12    group is familiar with this set, but
\par 
\par           13    basically, the Office of Management and
\par 
\par           14    Budget designates certain indicators as
\par 
\par           15    Principal Economic Indicators, and they are
\par 
\par           16    subject to a number of rules.  They have to
\par 
\par           17    be released exactly on schedule; they have to
\par 
\par           18    be embargoed prior to release.
\par 
\par           19              And if you look at the indicator
\par 
\par           20    sets on the BLS and Census Bureau websites,
\par 
\par           21    you'll find that they correspond very closely
\par 
\par           22    to the PEIs that those agencies produce.

\par 
\par 
\par            1              So one of the questions we thought
\par 
\par            2    about was if we have more PEIs coming in,
\par 
\par            3    should they automatically be added to the
\par 
\par            4    list?  We didn't go that far, although we
\par 
\par            5    thought that the fact that an indicator was a
\par 
\par            6    PEI would be a strong argument, but we really
\par 
\par            7    wanted this indicator set to serve a
\par 
\par            8    particular purpose, and the fact that an
\par 
\par            9    indicator was a PEI wouldn't necessarily mean
\par 
\par           10    that it helped served that purpose of giving
\par 
\par           11    the user the big picture of the energy
\par 
\par           12    situation.
\par 
\par           13              For example, there are PEIs on the
\par 
\par           14    list.  If you look at the entire list of
\par 
\par           15    PEIs, not just EIAs, that don't look terribly
\par 
\par           16    relevant to the average person -- some of
\par 
\par           17    them from the Department of Agriculture,
\par 
\par           18    they're like pigs and hogs and things like
\par 
\par           19    that -- the numbers of pigs and hogs -- there
\par 
\par           20    are -- those are principal economic
\par 
\par           21    indicators, but they might not be things that
\par 
\par           22    ordinary people think that much about.

\par 
\par 
\par            1              So other issues -- I talked a
\par 
\par            2    little bit about frequency aggregation
\par 
\par            3    levels.  Specifically there are indicators,
\par 
\par            4    things like electricity generation that EIA
\par 
\par            5    puts out both monthly and annually, and one
\par 
\par            6    of the issues that we are facing there is
\par 
\par            7    that the annual numbers are not as current as
\par 
\par            8    the monthly numbers.
\par 
\par            9              But the monthly numbers have
\par 
\par           10    seasonality in them, and we don't seasonally
\par 
\par           11    adjust them.  So if we're targeting this user
\par 
\par           12    who wants the big picture of the energy
\par 
\par           13    situation, do we give them the older annual
\par 
\par           14    number or do we give them the monthly number
\par 
\par           15    which is subject to seasonal variation but is
\par 
\par           16    more current than the annual?  It's not
\par 
\par           17    really straightforward to decide between
\par 
\par           18    those.
\par 
\par           19              There are also some indicators were
\par 
\par           20    have both the average or the total and then
\par 
\par           21    we have the change over time, and which one
\par 
\par           22    should be presented upfront is another issue.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    You saw on the BLS website they present the
\par 
\par            2    change upfront and you have to drill down to
\par 
\par            3    get to the index number or the total.
\par 
\par            4              That's another question, which
\par 
\par            5    should be upfront or should they both be sort
\par 
\par            6    of on a equal basis?
\par 
\par            7              Our group focused primarily on the
\par 
\par            8    content.  We did talk a little bit about the
\par 
\par            9    presentation, the documentation, and the
\par 
\par           10    standard errors that would presented, because
\par 
\par           11    we felt that really the usefulness of this
\par 
\par           12    indicator collection would probably depend in
\par 
\par           13    large part on the quality of the metadata
\par 
\par           14    that we could present along with it.
\par 
\par           15              We didn't make hard decisions on
\par 
\par           16    presentation, although we felt that in many
\par 
\par           17    cases, a graphical presentation of our
\par 
\par           18    indicators would probably be best, rather
\par 
\par           19    than something like the numbers that you saw\ltrpar 
\par 
\par           20    on the BLS website.
\par 
\par           21              This is an issue where we would

\par            1    errors -- often, we in some cases don't have

\par

\par 
\par            7    the talk, which is presenting the actual set
\par 
\par            8    of indicators that we're recommending.  You
\par 
\par            9    have a handout -- I think I distributed it to
\par 
\par           10    the Committee members -- and this might be
\par 
\par           11    helpful as Joe goes through these indicators.
\par 
\par           12              There's a list at the end of that
\par 
\par           13    handout, the last page of the handout, that
\par 
\par           14    shows the indicators, gives a short blurb on
\par 
\par           15    each one, and they are divided into
\par 
\par           16    categories that might make it a little bit
\par 
\par           17    easier to digest them.
\par 
\par           18              There are 13 of them in all, but
\par 
\par           19    they fall into really three or four broad
\par 
\par           20    categories.  One of them is prices, and we
\par 
\par           21    have both consumer and producer prices.
\par

\par

\par            1    have to do with supply, consumption and the

\par 
\par            3    we hope, might be changing in the future, and
\par 
\par            4    also, some things having to do with the
\par

\par 
\par           17    a good statistical representative sample -- a
\par 
\par           18    little bit of everything.  It has new things,

\par           15              Not much argument for including
\par 
\par           16    these two, I think.  This is information
\par 
\par           17    that's already available.  We've put it out
\par 
\par           18    there on the petroleum page, so it's very
\par 
\par           19    easy to include.  We all need the gas pump,
\par 
\par           20    or most of us every day, so that's clearly

\par 
\par           12    or does somebody else produce it?
\par

\par 
\par            4    indicator list quite easily.
\par

\par 
\par            7    residential price of natural gas.  The
\par 
\par            8    monthly and annual data for this comes from
\par 
\par            9    two Office of Oil and Gas surveys here at

\par 
\par           11              According to the 2000 census,
\par 
\par           12    approximately half the households in the
\par 
\par           13    country heat with gas from utilities, and
\par 
\par           14    another eight to nine percent heat with
\par 
\par           15    propane.  So you add those together, about
\par 
\par           16    60 percent of the households use gas for
\par 
\par           17    heating -- again, a major, obvious, consumer
\par 
\par           18    expenditure, just the sort of thing you'd
\par 
\par           19    want in a list of this nature.
\par 
\par           20              This is an indicator that's so new

\par 
\par           16    consumed for energy each year in this country

\par 
\par            5    it as soon as we could.
\par 
\par            6              So general comments on the ones we
\par 
\par            7    selected?  Are there indicators th\ltrpar at you feel
\par 
\par            8    should be on the list that are not on the
\par 
\par            9    list?  Also, we'd welcome comments on the
\par 
\par           10    issue of aggregation, frequency, should
\par 
\par           11    the most recent number always be first, or is
\par 
\par           12    it more appropriate in some cases to put up
\par 
\par           13    an older number because it doesn't have
\par 
\par           14    seasonality or because we just know more have
\par 
\par           15    that number?
\par 
\par           16              Also, we probably need some advice
\par 
\par           17    on error measures.  There are cases where for
\par 
\par           18    example, we have on the home page now this
\par 
\par           19    gasoline price -- the average gasoline price,
\par 
\par           20    and we've put very prominently the change
\par 
\par           21    from the previous week and the change from
\par 
\par           22    the previous year, but we can't really say

\par

\par 
\par            9    designated discussants for this, and Tom --
\par 
\par           10              MR. RUTHERFORD:  You want me to go
\par 
\par           11    first?
\par 
\par           12              MR. NEERCHAL:  Yeah.
\par 
\par           13              MR. RUTHERFORD:  I first would say
\par 
\par           14    this looks like a great idea, what's not to
\par 
\par           15    like about it?  This is central to the core
\par 
\par           16    mission of EIA, providing -- in my view, the
\par 
\par           17    EIA's main role has been to help markets work
\par 
\par           18    better, and up 'til now focusing on market
\par 
\par           19    statistics; we have the situation, energy
\par 
\par           20    markets we know demand losses -- these are
\par 
\par           21    very low in short-term.

\par 
\par            1    information is very important, you don't want
\par 
\par            2    to be caught off-guard and it's a very useful
\par 
\par            3    sort of -- I'm not very good at designing
\par 
\par            4    websites.  I always tend to be overly
\par 
\par            5    simplistic in the way I do things like I
\par 
\par            6    can't comment very much about that, but let
\par 
\par            7    me just reflect on some general ideas.  This
\par 
\par            8    may be a little bit broader brush than you're
\par 
\par            9    looking for in terms for advice.
\par 
\par           10              First thing, I would say that the
\par 
\par           11    duplication of market data is not necessarily
\par 
\par           12    I don't think a bad thing.  If you have an
\par 
\par           13    independent estimate of numbers, then I would
\par 
\par           14    say that that could be useful.
\par 
\par           15              If you have differences, then
\par 
\par           16    that's a useful thing.  Particularly when
\par 
\par           17    something as important as oil prices or
\par 
\par           18    various -- these statistics that matter, I
\par 
\par           19    think that doesn't belong -- that's fine.  I
\par 
\par           20    also like to attempt to create an energy
\par 
\par           21    consumption price index.  I think that is
\par 
\par           22    also useful -- thinking about -- what does

\par            1    mean for individuals?  And that's useful to
\par 
\par            2    reflect on the role of energy in the economy
\par 
\par            3    and so again, I think creatively, it's good.
\par 
\par            4              I think that the key top items that
\par 
\par            5    you are looking at, you have already hit the
\par 
\par            6    ones that really matter, and these other
\par 
\par            7    ones, there's lot of different choices you
\par 
\par            8    have.
\par 
\par            9              I don't think you are going to make
\par 
\par           10    a big mistake by picking any one of the
\par 
\par           11    various choices.  The key question you have
\par 
\par           12    to ask in this work I think is who is your
\par 
\par           13    client?  So in the write-up, the discussion
\par 
\par           14    was about the client being the voter, right,
\par 
\par           15    so people -- or the great school class that's
\par 
\par           16    interested in learning about where does the
\par 
\par           17    energy come from, or the interest in sort of
\par 
\par           18    like we have the amateur energy analyst wants
\par 
\par           19    to look.
\par 
\par           20              But I'd say there also, you could
\par 
\par           21    think about the client, and again -- in
\par 
\par           22    reading the thing, I was thinking about the

\par 
\par            1    debate in energy modeling about the role of
\par 
\par            2    market failure in energies markets -- a lot
\par 
\par            3    of sort of back and forth about how much
\par 
\par            4    carbon abatement can we get a negative
\par 
\par            5    crisis (?) right?
\par 
\par            6              How many people are wasting money
\par 
\par            7    on energy that is just not smart enough, or
\par 
\par            8    perhaps it takes too much, it's too
\par 
\par            9    costly -- another argument -- sort of if you
\par 
\par           10    believe that consumers are fundamentally
\par 
\par           11    rational but it's not worth their time to
\par 
\par           12    figure out how much does it take -- how much
\par 
\par           13    is it  costing them to have that second
\par 
\par           14    refrigerator in the basement that's just
\par 
\par           15    holding beer?
\par 
\par           16              Some people may not be actually
\par 
\par           17    paying attention to the stuff, and so one
\par 
\par           18    role that this could provide -- if you are
\par 
\par           19    trying to provide feedback -- is to try to
\par 
\par           20    help markets work better.  This is a
\par 
\par           21    different angle than just helping the energy

\par 
\par            1    natural gas.
\par 
\par            2              You may be helping the individual
\par 
\par            3    homeowner make decisions about -- well, how
\par 
\par            4    useful is it to reinsulate the attic, or does
\par 
\par            5    it pay to -- putting new windows in costs
\par 
\par            6    $2,000, how fast would that pay back?  So I
\par 
\par            7    think the things -- that if you are trying to
\par 
\par            8    look for a client which is the general
\par 
\par            9    public, which is kind of interested in
\par 
\par           10    feedback, then things that help provide that
\par 
\par           11    sort of information could actually help
\par 
\par           12    markets operate well from a different
\par 
\par           13    standpoint than has traditionally bee\ltrpar n EIA's
\par 
\par           14    mandate.
\par 
\par           15              And so here, I'm thinking about
\par 
\par           16    sort of end use efficiency -- you have the
\par 
\par           17    wherewithal to go out and measure these
\par 
\par           18    things for a couple of sample places.  And
\par 
\par           19    I'm sure you do in some of your surveys.  I
\par 
\par           20    noticed the survey was talking about end use
\par 
\par           21    indices -- these sorts of things could
\par 
\par           22    actually help markets operate more

\par 
\par 
\par            1    efficiently by communicating to the
\par 
\par            2    individuals that they could perhaps think a
\par 
\par            3    second time about -- okay, well what's the
\par 
\par            4    role of compact fluorescence?
\par 
\par            5              There's a variety of decisions, a
\par 
\par            6    range of things I -- and that's going to vary
\par 
\par            7    regionally across different census regions.
\par 
\par            8    So this sort of thing I'm thinking just as a
\par 
\par            9    way that EIA could expand this mandate to
\par 
\par           10    help markets operate differently, but not
\par 
\par           11    just the client -- not just aiming at the
\par 
\par           12    energy analysts who are trying to make bets
\par 
\par           13    on different directions of prices.
\par 
\par           14              I like -- the historical trends I
\par 
\par           15    think is really good.  I basically think
\par 
\par           16    there is not much to not like about the idea
\par 
\par           17    of approving -- better marketing the data
\par 
\par           18    that's already collected.  And I would
\par 
\par           19    encourage just to go ahead and take a crack
\par 
\par           20    at it.  It's not as though it's -- I mean,
\par 
\par           21    you want to have consistency in the main
\par 
\par           22    items you are going to want to keep up there,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    but experiment a little bit, and you don't
\par 
\par            2    have to worry so much about whether you get
\par 
\par            3    it perfectly right at the beginning.
\par 
\par            4              And clearly, if interest in climate
\par 
\par            5    change continues to increase at the
\par 
\par            6    exponential rate we've seen in the last
\par 
\par            7    couple of years, then I'd say getting ahead
\par 
\par            8    of the ball -- grams of carbon per dollar of
\par 
\par            9    GDP, that's something I wrote a paper on
\par 
\par           10    1993; right?
\par 
\par           11              So we can think about -- I think
\par 
\par           12    you could get ahead here and think about
\par 
\par           13    information again that is directed at helping
\par 
\par           14    inform the public about the magnitude of the
\par 
\par           15    costs involved and what basically -- where
\par 
\par           16    does carbon come from; there's lots of other
\par 
\par           17    indices that are related to carbon intensity
\par 
\par           18    and greenhouse gas emissions that could be
\par 
\par           19    relevant.
\par 
\par           20              Again, I think that you want to
\par 
\par           21    think -- getting back to my basic theme of my

\par            1    the basic sort of agenda, and how can you
\par 
\par            2    help markets operate better?
\par 
\par            3              Just the main sort of ideas.
\par 
\par            4              MR. NEERCHAL:  Thanks.  I'm listed
\par 
\par            5    as a discussant, and that's why I think for
\par 
\par            6    two reasons, I want to make it very brief.
\par 
\par            7              I think number one, we are running
\par 
\par            8    late.  Number two, this is definitely not an
\par 
\par            9    area of my expertise.  But I do want to make
\par 
\par           10    a couple of -- I want to join Tom in really
\par 
\par           11    commending you on -- it's a tremendous
\par 
\par           12    project.
\par 
\par           13              It's a huge effort -- I think
\par 
\par           14    because of the various people involved.  I
\par 
\par           15    think that we are treading on some
\par 
\par           16    tricky -- no matter what set of 13 you come
\par 
\par           17    up with, there will always be people who
\par 
\par           18    think that there should be one other thing
\par 
\par           19    and something else would come out, and so
\par 
\par           20    it's going to be a kind of no-win list really
\par 
\par           21    in a way.
\par 
\par           22              So I think I would be very curious

\par 
\par            1    to hear some stories from the process of
\par 
\par            2    elimination that -- what arguments you have
\par 
\par            3    to give.  One comment in that regard, I think
\par 
\par            4    you might want to really look at it from the
\par 
\par            5    point of categorizing these indicators from
\par 
\par            6    the point of view of the customer.
\par 
\par            7              And that might be even useful for
\par 
\par            8    you in the website, so maybe group them, say
\par 
\par            9    these are more -- these are for the high
\par 
\par           10    school student, these are for the experts and
\par 
\par           11    so on.  I think that might actually help you
\par 
\par           12    decide -- to say some of them maybe -- need
\par 
\par           13    to be more detailed than others.  If your
\par 
\par           14    client is a researcher, they just don't want
\par 
\par           15    any pictures, just want all the data, every
\par 
\par           16    piece of information.
\par 
\par           17              On the other hand, if you're a
\par 
\par           18    middle school teacher or high school teacher,
\par 
\par           19    you may want something that is ready made
\par 
\par           20    with the pictures already prepared and that
\par 
\par           21    he or she can use in the classroom to make
\par 
\par           22    the kids more aware of what's going on.

\par            1              And a related comment on that, a
\par 
\par            2    comment related to that is -- I think I heard
\par 
\par            3    at least couple of meetings ago some research
\par 
\par            4    into the kind of people who are using your
\par 
\par            5    website and downloading and so on.
\par 
\par            6              And it's possible that you might
\par 
\par            7    get some information from that kind of
\par 
\par            8    research -- what is more popular or what is
\par 
\par            9    less popular and so on.
\par 
\par           10              So I want to stop right there and
\par 
\par           11    open the floor for discussion by the
\par 
\par           12    Committee members.
\par

\par 
\par           14              MS. KHANNA:  Thank you.  I have a
\par 
\par           15    bunch of comments, and I think, even though
\par 
\par           16    I'm an "expert," I would also be one of the
\par 
\par           17    uses of these key indicators, most
\par 
\par           18    specifically in a classroom setting -- and
\par 
\par           19    already I always have a link to the E\ltrpar IA
\par 
\par           20    website when I teach my environmental
\par 
\par           21    economics class, and I bring it up at least
\par 
\par           22    once every two weeks or so.

\par 
\par 
\par            1              So looking at that perspective, I
\par 
\par            2    think to answer some of your questions, I
\par 
\par            3    think for the key indicators, I like the idea
\par 
\par            4    of dropdown menus, because you're talking
\par 
\par            5    about 13 key indicators, putting them right
\par 
\par            6    upfront on the webpage, your webpage is going
\par 
\par            7    to be very cluttered and it's not going to be
\par 
\par            8    that easy to find.  So having something bold
\par 
\par            9    which says "Key Indicator," which grabs your
\par 
\par           10    eye the moment you go to the website I think
\par 
\par           11    is a nicer thing, and then you could have all
\par 
\par           12    your dropdown menus.
\par 
\par           13              And in there -- I would argue for
\par 
\par           14    the big aggregates, because you said that
\par 
\par           15    your focus was to give the big picture.  And
\par 
\par           16    having said that, it means more of the
\par 
\par           17    annual, more reliable numbers that you have
\par 
\par           18    as opposed to the more frequent and possibly
\par 
\par           19    less reliable numbers.
\par 
\par           20              One thing that you could do is
\par 
\par           21    let's say you have a graph of annual
\par 
\par           22    petroleum consumption -- have that historical

\par 
\par 
\par            1    graph.  And then somewhere in there you could
\par 
\par            2    have a link to more-detailed data, so that
\par 
\par            3    actually draws the casual EIA website user
\par 
\par            4    into the more-detailed parts and that's one
\par 
\par            5    way of marketing what you're doing and say
\par 
\par            6    look, these big numbers are there if you want
\par 
\par            7    to use them, but if you want more data, you
\par 
\par            8    can go from here directly back into the
\par 
\par            9    petroleum consumption page, which is just
\par 
\par           10    linked to that.  That would be actually very
\par 
\par           11    useful, because you'll then the educating
\par 
\par           12    beyond just big numbers.
\par 
\par           13              I think -- I'm personally very
\par 
\par           14    comfortable with having non-EIA indicators,
\par 
\par           15    as long as you indicate that these were not
\par 
\par           16    prepared by EIA, and that you've got them
\par 
\par           17    from elsewhere.  And the reason I argue for
\par 
\par           18    this is because EIA -- I think of EIA as the
\par 
\par           19    place to get energy data.  I think we want to
\par 
\par           20    keep that.
\par 
\par           21              And if I have to go to a trade

\par            1    data or some other data, then you're already
\par 
\par            2    shooting yourself in the foot because then I
\par 
\par            3    don't think the EIA is the best place when I
\par 
\par            4    think of energy data.  So I would argue for
\par 
\par            5    that.
\par 
\par            6              I think those are my points, but I
\par 
\par            7    think I would strongly argue for annual
\par 
\par            8    numbers with links right on the graphical
\par

\par

\par 
\par           13              MR. WEYANT:  A couple of things.
\par 
\par           14    One, I do agree on the user perspective.  I
\par 
\par           15    wonder if you could even survey people
\par 
\par           16    directly in those categories before you go
\par 
\par           17    public.  It seems like now you have people
\par 
\par           18    who deal with the users, but not the actual
\par 
\par           19    users.  People who deal with users is a big
\par 
\par           20    proxy, but I wouldn't -- you could have like
\par 
\par           21    a focus group.  Just invite a bunch of high
\par 
\par           22    school kids, a bunch of experts, a bunch

\par 
\par 
\par            1    of -- kind of educated people in the, what,
\par 
\par            2    46 percent category.
\par 
\par            3              Point two, there's a hornets' nest
\par 
\par            4    involved in the intensity indicators, both
\par 
\par            5    energy and carbon, so you should be aware of
\par 
\par            6    that.
\par 
\par            7              I actually have a big argument
\par 
\par            8    going on with one of my former students on
\par 
\par            9    what you can actually include from the
\par 
\par           10    intensity measures.  So the short version of
\par 
\par           11    the debate is intensity may or may not
\par 
\par           12    be -- probably is somewhat correlated with
\par 
\par           13    efficiency, but there's a tendency for people
\par 
\par           14    to interpret those things as efficiency, as
\par 
\par           15    in things that are very good -- this goes
\par 
\par           16    back to Nagaraj's point on -- it could be
\par 
\par           17    that all your heavy industry is going
\par 
\par           18    offshore and you are losing economic value.
\par 
\par           19              It's really the composition of
\par 
\par           20    industry shifting around.  So there are a
\par 
\par           21    couple of fixes for that -- one is to clearly
\par 
\par           22    state that this is just intensity numbers and

\par 
\par 
\par            1    not efficiency numbers.
\par 
\par            2              The other is you could do more work
\par 
\par            3    probably not appropriate for this, but
\par 
\par            4    interesting research probably some already
\par 
\par            5    done in EIA, to correct for the change in the
\par

\par 
\par            7    improvement in each sector.

\par 
\par            9    Actually, my student was trying to make this
\par 
\par           10    argument at a global scale, which is even
\par 
\par           11    worse, because you've got technology transfer

\par           15    regulations in California at some time, you
\par 
\par           16    got petrol transfer to China and so on.  So
\par 
\par           17    it is really quite a complicated sort of
\par

\par 
\par           19              Somewhat related to that, when do
\par 
\par           20    this, do you do the energy intensity?  Do you
\par 
\par           21    do primary or final demand?  That also

\par            1    heated debate on the direct conversion
\par 
\par            2    method, which was kind of slipped into the
\par 
\par            3    international statistics.  This has to do
\par 
\par            4    with -- renewable energy -- does it count as
\par 
\par            5    energy content of the actual electrons that
\par 
\par            6    come out of the solar cell?  Or do you do the
\par 
\par            7    more historical, traditional, do a fossil
\par 
\par            8    fuel equivalent conversion, so it measures
\par 
\par            9    the amount of primary energy displaced by the
\par 
\par           10    renewables?
\par 
\par           11              I don't know how you come out on
\par 
\par           12    that.  But those will be kind of
\par 
\par           13    interpretation problems.  If that is avoided
\par 
\par           14    by and large if you just do kind of further
\par 
\par           15    downstream metrics like -- purchased by
\par 
\par           16    consumers or something like that.

\par 
\par           18    end use energy.  I think the biggest single
\par 
\par           19    gap I see in global analyses, even in the
\par 
\par           20    U.S., is the paucity of data on end use

\par 
\par            2              There's a project that someone
\par 
\par            3    ought to do.
\par 
\par            4              It's hard for EIA because it's a
\par 
\par            5    little bit more the expert on U.S., and a
\par 
\par            6    little bit less globally, but I know for the
\par 
\par            7    modeling committee, just like Tom said, there
\par 
\par            8    is this huge debate about energy efficiency
\par 
\par            9    gaps that persist, and if you had and use
\par 
\par           10    data, it would be easier to sort those out.
\par 
\par           11              That may be more an analyst thing.
\par 
\par           12    So that may be a project for EIA perhaps, but
\par 
\par           13    not something for this particular project.
\par 
\par           14              Last on data display -- maybe
\par 
\par           15    idiosyncratic but -- I like to watch stock
\par 
\par           16    market indices, probably because most of my
\par 
\par           17    retirement fund is in something like a NASDAQ
\par 
\par           18    index.  But what I like to do, I think there
\par 
\par           19    may be some utility of this, it's a kind of
\par 
\par           20    funny drill-down thing -- if you've seen like
\par 
\par           21    MSN or -- I don't know where they get their

\par 
\par           15    lot of money in the stock market crash; I
\par 
\par           16    like to go back and look at the trend before

\par 
\par 
\par            1    back to the question of the audience.
\par 
\par            2    Several years ago, I organized a session at
\par 
\par            3    the American Statistical Association meetings
\par 
\par            4    in which one of the speakers was an analyst
\par 
\par            5    from Merrill Lynch talking about data
\par 
\par            6    problems, and he pointed out that our data
\par 
\par            7    from EIA now is old, obsolete, and not useful
\par 
\par            8    to the market.  They cannot operate a market
\par 
\par            9    on the data generally that the EIA gave them.
\par 
\par           10              Now, this natural gas and storage
\par 
\par           11    number which the administrator said is a
\par 
\par           12    market-moving number is kind of a counter to
\par 
\par           13    that.  In general, I would think it would be
\par 
\par           14    useful if the EIA had the support of industry
\par 
\par           15    in terms of whatever it's looking to do,
\par 
\par           16    budget or whatever -- and so targeting the
\par 
\par           17    non-industry audience as the sole key
\par 
\par           18    audience may not be as useful as if you could
\par 
\par           19    include more industry audience in whatever
\par 
\par           20    products you have.
\par 
\par           21              And if one of the issues is to make
\par 
\par           22    the markets work better, then you should have

\par 
\par 
\par            1    data that's useful to the markets.  Long-term
\par 
\par            2    decisions by consumers about drinking less
\par 
\par            3    beer or moving the refrigerator out of the
\par 
\par            4    basement are useful, but also the people who
\par 
\par            5    make the markets are fairly useful.  I
\par 
\par            6    noticed you have the West Texas Intermediate,
\par 
\par            7    West Texas crude in there.
\par 
\par            8              But there's a futures market.  The
\par 
\par            9    Washington Post publishes the futures price
\par 
\par           10    every morning.  Why are we not publishing the
\par 
\par           11    futures price here?  I have a number of other
\par 
\par           12    detailed comments, but I think overall, it's
\par 
\par           13    a good idea to do this.  Overall, I think you
\par 
\par           14    should rethink this question about what you
\par 
\par           15    are assuming the audience is -- but it is a
\par 
\par           16    work at progress, and you should get going.
\par 
\par           17              You will get feedback from people
\par 
\par           18    who will tell you this or this is hard to
\par 
\par           19    use.
\par 
\par           20              I wouldn't have a problem with just
\par 
\par           21    starting as soon as possible.  Some other the
\par

\par            1    ask the question again why are you comparing

\par

\par 
\par            8    download this material also for my classes,
\par

\par           11    They should be able to pull the tabulated

\par 
\par           13    it in a program -- whether it's in the part
\par 
\par           14    of a regression that you are running -- model
\par 
\par           15    building, graphical analysis -- whatever.
\par 
\par           16              The question about why -- one
\par 
\par           17    question occurred to me, if Bloomberg
\par 
\par           18    publishes data without a lag, why the devil
\par 
\par           19    are you publishing it with a lag?  I mean
\par 
\par           20    it's out there without a lag.  If data is
\par 
\par           21    available, why do you want to put a lag into
\par 
\par           22    it?  Why --

\par 
\par           11              One of the questions that Neha

\par

\par 
\par           14    do need to have links to the others -- maybe
\par 
\par           15    just a link, maybe not publishing what
\par 
\par           16    Bloomberg has or what that you could find
\par 
\par           17    from BLS -- but you should have a disclaimer
\par 
\par           18    in there that yes, if you want to see other

\par            2              As to standard errors I'd stick 'em
\par 
\par            3    in.  I think some sort of error measurement
\par 
\par            4    should be published at least if nothing else
\par 
\par            5    in a footnote.  People are used to using the
\par 
\par            6    surveys, from say, CBS or Wall Street
\par 
\par            7    Journal, which say plus or minus 3 percent,
\par 
\par            8    or whatever it is.
\par 
\par            9              And you people have put an immense
\par 
\par           10    effort and a very laudable effort into trying
\par 
\par           11    to get your data accuracy down.  And I think,
\par 
\par           12    therefore, you should be proud to say -- this
\par 
\par           13    is our measure of this but we do have this
\par 
\par           14    error there, because you've really isolated
\par 
\par           15    the sources of error and have worked very
\par 
\par           16    hard to eliminate error that's in there.
\par 
\par           17              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think you had your
\par 
\par           18    hand up earlier so, before you --
\par 
\par           19              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Let me see if I
\par 
\par           20    can finish up on this really quickly.
\par 
\par           21              Some of the things that you're
\par

\par

\par 
\par            3    metrics rather than try to reinvent the
\par 
\par            4    wheel?
\par 
\par            5              I know the BLS may not -- being a
\par 
\par            6    federal agency, may not move as rapidly as
\par 
\par            7    you would like.  But since they do this, they
\par 
\par            8    are considered the source of all kinds of
\par 
\par            9    consumer price index data -- it may be useful
\par 
\par           10    to at least work with them to see if there is
\par 
\par           11    some way to improve the errors.
\par 
\par           12              And one other thing is that if you
\par 
\par           13    are going to look at electricity in any case

\par 
\par           15    somewhere a variable on transmission
\par 
\par           16    capacity, which I think is going to be one of
\par 
\par           17    the limiting factors in electricity in the

\par

\par 
\par           22    people have I think is shown by the fact that

\par 
\par            4              MR. BLAIR:  I would just like to
\par 
\par            5    say quickly, if this to be
\par 
\par            6    market-driven -- and these points have been
\par 
\par            7    made -- if this is to be market-driven, as a
\par 
\par            8    practical matter, you're going to have
\par 
\par            9    different market segments interested in
\par 
\par           10    different sections of the sites; the people
\par 
\par           11    who are interested in energy intensity, for
\par 
\par           12    example, are not necessarily going to be the
\par 
\par           13    same people who would be interested in price.
\par 
\par           14              You won't get it right the first

\par 
\par            3    I'm not sure who else, but I know Census, Gas
\par 
\par            4    has an ongoing program of measuring usage of
\par 
\par            5    their webpage, they use popup surveys; I
\par 
\par            6    think that they get a good response to it.
\par 
\par            7    And basically, just probably their best
\par

\par 
\par           11              MR. NEERCHAL:  Okay, quick comment.
\par 
\par           12              MS. KHANNA:  I actually think a lot
\par 
\par           13    of the Committees are coming in -- I feel as
\par 
\par           14    more exposures as in the kind of details that
\par 
\par           15    we are bringing up -- only people who already
\par 
\par           16    work with energy data are going to bring up,
\par 
\par           17    and I don't think that was the target for
\par 
\par           18    your key indicators.  So I would argue that I
\par 
\par           19    would still go with the big numbers, and then
\par 
\par           20    be able from there to link into detailed
\par 
\par           21    data, like you said, being able to download
\par 
\par           22    if there's a graph of change in fuel -- in

\par 
\par 
\par            1    let's say -- you know, fuel consumption,
\par 
\par            2    that's fine -- give me the big item.  If I
\par 
\par            3    want to know how much or what the data are or
\par 
\par            4    what the breakdown is, then there should be a
\par 
\par            5    direct link from there to one of your more
\par 
\par            6    detailed pages, because the information is
\par 
\par            7    there already.
\par 
\par            8              Why keep repeating it?  Why not
\par 
\par            9    just give the broad aggregates and then have
\par 
\par           10    people go into the -- drill-down basically to
\par 
\par           11    more detailed information if they are
\par 
\par           12    interested?
\par 
\par           13              MS. LENT:  That was the idea, that
\par 
\par           14    the detailed data are certainly there.  It's
\par 
\par           15    more to help the person who wants the big
\par 
\par           16    picture first to get that without having to
\par 
\par           17    necessarily go down to all the detail there.
\par 
\par           18              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think a related
\par 
\par           19    comment on the standard error is that the
\par 
\par           20    computation of standard error is quite
\par 
\par           21    complicated and is sort of different from one
\par 
\par           22    survey to another because of the structure of

\par 
\par 
\par            1    the surveys are so different.
\par 
\par            2              So I think if you just put standard
\par 
\par            3    error in all the indicators -- there's a
\par 
\par            4    danger that somebody thinks that they are all
\par 
\par            5    equally reliable estimates of uncertainly.
\par 
\par            6              MS. LENT:  We need the second, the
\par 
\par            7    third moment as well.
\par 
\par            8              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think, yeah.
\par 
\par            9              MS. LENT:  Reliable or the
\par 
\par           10    reliability.
\par 
\par           11              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think there's a
\par 
\par           12    danger like that.  There's a tough task to
\par 
\par           13    really present that standard error on the
\par 
\par           14    website.  That's -- even though I'm not the
\par 
\par           15    statistician -- give me standard at any time,
\par 
\par           16    but you may need several caveats on each one
\par 
\par           17    of them.
\par 
\par           18              I think in the interest of time, we
\par 
\par           19    should kind of stop this discussion here.
\par 
\par           20              And I think this is definitely a
\par 
\par           21    topic I'm sure the Committee would like to
\par 
\par           22    see again -- based on the interest we've seen

\par 
\par            2              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  I'd like to have
\par 
\par            3    one question.
\par 
\par            4              MR. NEERCHAL:  Sure.
\par 
\par            5              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  When can I log
\par 
\par            6    on and get the first data version of this?
\par 
\par            7    Do you think by February 1st or before April?
\par 
\par            8              MR. NEERCHAL:  Not next --
\par 
\par            9              MS. LENT:  We're hoping to wrap up
\par 
\par           10    this project by the end of this month.  That
\par 
\par           11    doesn't mean that -- well, our project is to
\par 
\par           12    identify the preliminary set.  There's
\par 
\par           13    another layer about the presentation, but
\par 
\par           14    it's probably going to have to be addressed
\par 
\par           15    by a different group that's more geared
\par 
\par           16    toward web design.
\par 
\par           17              So we still have that step coming.
\par 
\par           18              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  It might be
\par

\par           17              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think we should
\par 
\par           18    probably take a five-minute break.
\par 
\par           19              I suggest that you take a quick
\par 
\par           20    five-minute break.
\par 
\par           21              We have break-out sessions.  The

\par 
\par            7    that to keep it on time?  I think that we
\par 
\par            8    should probably -- I'm going to call that we
\par 
\par            9    are 10 minutes behind even though really we
\par 
\par           10    are 20 or so -- so that we can absorb the 10
\par

\par 
\par           12              We should really plan on getting

\par           15              MR. MAYES:  Thank you very much for
\par 
\par           16    the opportunity to present to you.  It's been
\par 
\par           17    a long time, probably too long, since I've
\par 
\par           18    tal\ltrpar ked to the ASA people about energy.  My
\par 
\par           19    name is Fred Mayes.  My background is, I've
\par 
\par           20    spent a decade with the Census Bureau working
\par 
\par           21    on time series, and to a lesser degree,
\par 
\par           22    sampling applications of economic data, and

\par 
\par 
\par            1    since then, I've been at the Department of
\par 
\par            2    Energy, EIA, for 27 years.
\par 
\par            3              I've worked in a variety of areas.
\par 
\par            4    I worked in the office sponsoring this
\par 
\par            5    seminar, in the Statistical Methods Group.  I
\par 
\par            6    spent some time doing coal trade export
\par 
\par            7    analysis; I've done nuclear power analysis
\par 
\par            8    briefly; I've worked in areas of statistical
\par 
\par            9    quality control on products; and a little bit
\par 
\par           10    in modeling on renewables, but most of my
\par 
\par           11    time here has been where I am now, which is
\par 
\par           12    in charge of the renewable energy and
\par 
\par           13    alternate transportation fuel data and
\par 
\par           14    analysis -- short-term analysis program.
\par 
\par           15              So I want to start out by saying
\par 
\par           16    that this is really a very propitious time
\par 
\par           17    for us to be talking about solar.  On the one
\par 
\par           18    hand, the Solar Decathlon is sitting on the
\par 
\par           19    Mall with all the new solar energy homes, if
\par 
\par           20    you're interested.  And the other is that
\par 
\par           21    quite frankly, if we hadn't scheduled, and
\par 
\par           22    you hadn't expressed an interest in this

\par 
\par            1    topic of solar energy and electricity, it
\par 
\par            2    would have come up for us anyway, because in
\par 
\par            3    the last year or so, there's been a radical
\par 
\par            4    change in the market, which I will describe
\par 
\par            5    to you.  And it has raised issues for us
\par 
\par            6    because it's going to force us to change some
\par 
\par            7    of the ways that we've been presenting solar
\par 
\par            8    energy.
\par 
\par            9              So with that, let me get started on
\par 
\par           10    my presentation.  Just to let you know, this
\par 
\par           11    is not anything that we necessarily would
\par 
\par           12    publish, but we're seeking your advice on it.
\par 
\par           13    What I'm going to do is first, I would like
\par 
\par           14    to show you the overall context of solar
\par 
\par           15    energy in the U.S. energy picture, discuss
\par 
\par           16    what our data is, the characteristics of it,
\par 
\par           17    and give you some questions and consider a
\par 
\par           18    couple of ideas we have about solutions, and
\par 
\par           19    then open up the floor for anything that

\par 
\par            1    have seen this graph; it actually has become
\par 
\par            2    rather popular.  USA Today has used it, and
\par 
\par            3    it gets used all over the place, but I think
\par 
\par            4    it pretty well states and shows how renewable
\par 
\par            5    energy fits in.  It's about 7 percent of our
\par 
\par            6    nation's energy supply, and within that, you
\par 
\par            7    see that the big two are biomass and hydro.
\par 
\par            8              If you've been following our data
\par 
\par            9    closely, you'll notice that the biomass
\par 
\par           10    percentage appears to have increased, and
\par 
\par           11    that's because in the past year, we've
\par 
\par           12    revised our biomass data to include
\par 
\par           13    consumption that we had not been considering
\par 
\par           14    before that was not there and should have
\par 
\par           15    been, and it's namely the co-products from
\par 
\par           16    producing biofuels, and the losses in the
\par 
\par           17    co-products for producing biofuels; that is
\par 
\par           18    the losses in corn, the losses in soybeans,
\par 
\par           19    and so forth and so on.
\par 
\par           20              So we are now including those in
\par 
\par           21    biomass, so that's why the biomass percentage
\par 
\par           22    is a bit higher.  But you can see they take

\par 
\par            3    past three years from almost nothing to
\par 
\par            4    3 percent and it's going to continue to grow
\par 
\par            5    at least for the next two or three years at a
\par 
\par            6    very rapid rate.
\par 
\par            7              What happens after that, I'm not
\par 
\par            8    sure.  And then on the top three, you see the
\par 
\par            9    little bitty tiny contribution of solar, so
\par 
\par           10    solar is 1 percent of 7 percent, so when
\par 
\par           11    somebody asks you what's the contribution of
\par 
\par           12    solar, you can either calculate that or you
\par 
\par           13    can give them my answer, which is not very
\par 
\par           14    much.  So I'd like to give you the flavor for
\par 
\par           15    where the information that we use comes from.
\par 
\par           16              We have two main sources.  One is
\par 
\par           17    from our electricity surveys.  I believe
\par 
\par           18    you're going to have a session on that, about
\par 
\par           19    electricity tomorrow, but if you want to talk
\par 
\par           20    about where we get our information on central
\par 
\par           21    station electric power generation, it comes
\par 
\par           22    from the survey forms here, the 906/920 for

\par 
\par 
\par            1    our generation, and then for capacity, we get
\par 
\par            2    it from 860.  Now, this is for central
\par 
\par            3    station generation, but a lot of our
\par 
\par            4    information comes from a different source,
\par 
\par            5    probably one you may not have heard of.
\par 
\par            6              We've been running these surveys
\par 
\par            7    for a number of years.  We collect shipments
\par 
\par            8    of solar thermal panels from manufacturers,
\par 
\par            9    and shipments of photovoltaic cell module
\par 
\par           10    shipments from the PV manufacturers.  And the
\par 
\par           11    reason that these are important now is
\par 
\par           12    because -- well, first of all, let me just
\par 
\par           13    say that we report solar energy in our
\par 
\par           14    Renewable Energy Annual, which is online.
\par 
\par           15              Chapter 1 will show you consumption
\par 
\par           16    generation; Chapter 2 shows you the details
\par 
\par           17    on the manufacturers' activities in the
\par 
\par           18    reports I just mentioned.  And I've got the
\par 
\par           19    website listed there for you.  There's really
\par 
\par           20    two parts to solar.  There's solar thermal,
\par \ltrpar 
\par           21    that is generating energy for heat, and then
\par 
\par           22    there's photovoltaic, which is the

\par 
\par            4              What I'm showing here is the output
\par 
\par            5    of the generation that we get from solar
\par 
\par            6    thermal.  I'm going to discuss each of those
\par 
\par            7    two separately.  You can see it varies a lot.
\par 
\par            8    This is mainly for one 8-unit plant in
\par 
\par            9    California that was built in 1983.  What you
\par 
\par           10    may not know is that over and above what I
\par 
\par           11    showed you in the previous graph, about a
\par 
\par           12    fourth of the output of that plant is from
\par 
\par           13    natural gas.
\par 
\par           14              Now, you might not think that, and
\par 
\par           15    in our detailed data, it's appropriately
\par 
\par           16    labeled, but I just sort of want to give you
\par 
\par           17    that so that if you ever get surprised, it's
\par 
\par           18    true; a fourth of the generation of that
\par 
\par           19    solar plant comes from natural gas.
\par 
\par           20              And you know, as we always do, we
\par 
\par           21    allocate our generation according to fuel
\par

\par            4    to the primary fuel, which is of course solar
\par 
\par            5    thermal.
\par 
\par            6              We're not going to talk a whole lot
\par 
\par            7    about that here, because your interest was in
\par 
\par            8    solar energy for electricity, and about
\par 
\par            9    90 percent of solar thermal energy is for
\par 
\par           10    heating swimming pools.  Solar panel direct
\par 
\par           11    heat units -- that is until this
\par 
\par           12    year -- there have been some changes in the
\par 
\par           13    market.  If we go to photovoltaics, this is
\par 
\par           14    where the real interest and the big questions
\par 
\par           15    are.

\par

\par 
\par            3              I will talk a lot about that,
\par 
\par            4    that's where one of our big questions is.
\par 
\par            5    It's all -- there's a calculation of that,
\par 
\par            6    that large part of the bar.  You can see that
\par 
\par            7    the central station generation has grown a
\par 
\par            8    lot, but it's still mighty small, so you
\par 
\par            9    know, our main -- you know, we get good
\par 
\par           10    statistics on that from the electricity
\par 
\par           11    survey, so our main issue is down here in
\par 
\par           12    the -- whatever color that is, it's not the
\par 
\par           13    color that it was on my computer when I
\par 
\par           14    created it -- but in the dark center.
\par 
\par           15              As I said, photovoltaics is only
\par 
\par           16    for generating electricity, and so you
\par 
\par           17    understand some of the complexities here, PV
\par 
\par           18    can be used both on-grid and off-grid.  Now,
\par 
\par           19    on-grid is obvious what that is, connected to
\par 
\par           20    the central transmission and distribution
\par 
\par           21    facilities, but off-grid is two things.

\par

\par

\par 
\par           12    they decided a few years ago they should
\par

\par 
\par           14    the utility said that would be $13,000 a
\par 
\par           15    piece to dig up the concrete and put in the

\par

\par 
\par            2    they're tiny; that's off-grid.  There's
\par 
\par            3    another way you can cut the data.  You can

\par 
\par            4    to your other questions.  Don't the electric
\par 
\par            5    utilities keep track of how much it's coming

\par

\par 
\par           10    send you.  They know what you send them, but
\par 
\par           11    they don't know how much they would have sent
\par 
\par           12    you if you hadn't used anything.  That's the

\par           13    problem.
\par 
\par           14              MS. KHANNA:  But that's not -- why
\par 
\par           15    is that a problem?  Because we want to know
\par 
\par           16    how much electricity is being generated in

\par

\par 
\par           20    each, let's say, household, each rooftop is
\par 
\par           21    selling back to the grid.

\par 
\par            6    this much was sold back to the grid.

\par           10    that --
\par 
\par           11              MR. MAYES:  I guess that was my
\par 
\par           12    point.  Because that's electricity that's
\par 
\par           13    being generated that's not being captured in
\par

\par 
\par           18    there yet, but we're on the way to trying to
\par 
\par           19    see if we can get that data on how much is
\par 
\par           20    sold back into our published statistics.
\par 
\par           21    Until 2006, things were easy.  There hadn't

\par 
\par 
\par            1    in 20 years, and as you will see, our formula
\par

\par

\par 
\par            4              So you know, it was pretty easy for
\par 
\par            5    us to estimate, as you will see in a minute.
\par 
\par            6    But now what's happened is is that there are
\par 
\par            7    new central station applications coming on.
\par 
\par            8    If you look at the second point, we only
\par 
\par            9    collect information that's for plants that
\par 
\par           10    are over 1 megawatt, and currently, a lot of
\par 
\par           11    the new ones that are coming on are like
\par 
\par           12    around half a megawatt, so we're not going to
\par 
\par           13    capture them in the electricity survey
\par

\par 
\par           16    these dispersed applications like we thought
\par

\par

\par 
\par            3    problems.  We don't even know that, because
\par 
\par            4    there is no list out there that we can go to.
\par 
\par            5    These kind of facilities don't need a federal
\par 
\par            6    approval.  For example, I have a plant that
\par 
\par            7    wants to burn coal or natural gas or
\par 
\par            8    something, they have to get an EPA approval.
\par 
\par            9    These people don't, so there is no list to go
\par 
\par           10    to.  That's even another problem that I
\par 
\par           11    didn't mention, but it's a problem.
\par 
\par           12              MR. BLAIR:  Does anybody have
\par

\par

\par 
\par            4    We also have a whole grid of saying what end

\par            6    application, a remote broadcasting
\par 
\par            7    application?  What is it?  We also want to
\par 
\par            8    know what market sector are you shipping
\par 
\par            9    into?
\par 
\par           10              Is it residential, commercial,
\par 
\par           11    industrial, utility?  And we also ask them
\par 
\par           12    what is your recipient category?  Are you
\par 
\par           13    selling it to a seller/installer, an end
\par 
\par           14    user, a wholesaler, an exporter?  And we also
\par 
\par           15    ask whether they're exporting it, where do
\par 
\par           16    they do send it, domestically or if domestic
\par 
\par           17    by state, and if it's an export; if export,
\par 
\par           18    what country?

\par            1    the residential sector.  We don't what the
\par 
\par            2    end use was, and the worst thing that I'm
\par 
\par            3    going to show you on the next slide is, about
\par 
\par            4    40 percent of our market is exports, and when
\par 
\par            5    we ask for end use is the end use of all
\par 
\par            6    cells, which includes domestic and export.
\par 
\par            7              Market sector residential is for
\par 
\par            \ltrpar 8    the residential market here and abroad.  So
\par 
\par            9    we have a real problem because we don't know
\par 
\par           10    how to break out what's used domestically.
\par 
\par           11    I'm going to actually go ahead a slide and
\par 
\par           12    show you -- here are the statistics of the
\par 
\par           13    peak kilowatts and the exports, and you can
\par 
\par           14    see, as a percent of the total, it's up about
\par 
\par           15    40 percent; about 40 percent, so it's not a
\par 
\par           16    trivial problem.
\par 
\par           17              In 2007, we're going to solve this
\par 
\par           18    problem, because although we will collect the
\par 
\par           19    shipments for the entire market, for these
\par 
\par           20    detailed categories like end use and market
\par 
\par           21    sector, we're going to collect it only for
\par 
\par           22    domestic.

\par            1              So going forward for 2007 dated
\par 
\par            2    forward, we will know what the breakdowns
\par 
\par            3    are, and we construct to do so, except for
\par 
\par            4    one thing -- and that is the way we estimate
\par 
\par            5    this sector that's missing, that's not in
\par 
\par            6    these central station sectors -- remember up
\par 
\par            7    until now, we haven't had any problem because
\par 
\par            8    there aren't as many plants for the last 20
\par 
\par            9    years -- central station plants, solar
\par 
\par           10    plants, so our formula down at the bottom
\par 
\par           11    says that since we assume based on
\par 
\par           12    engineering data that the life for these
\par 
\par           13    cells is 20 years, you look at the cumulative
\par 
\par           14    shipments for 20 years domestically, which we
\par 
\par           15    have -- multiply it times the capacity factor
\par 
\par           16    for the cell, which is about 27.5 percent,
\par 
\par           17    and then times the hours in a year, and you
\par 
\par           18    get an estimate of the residential
\par 
\par           19    electricity generation.
\par 
\par           20              The problem is that now we're
\par 
\par           21    starting to get plants that are big ones,
\par 
\par           22    like the Nevada Solar Thermal One plant is a

\par 
\par 
\par            1    64-megawatt plant.
\par 
\par            2              It's a monster, which we don't have
\par 
\par            3    any way right now to offset in our formula.
\par 
\par            4    It hasn't been a problem until now, but we
\par 
\par            5    need to be able to offset these plants, so
\par 
\par            6    that's one problem.  Another problem which
\par 
\par            7    you'll see on a later slide is that we have
\par 
\par            8    all these other plants that are down in the
\par 
\par            9    .4 to .8 megawatt range, those should be
\par 
\par           10    properly classified in the utility sector,
\par 
\par           11    but right now, we're not doing it, we don't
\par 
\par           12    collect any information on it.  So it's a lot
\par 
\par           13    of things to juggle in your mind at once, but
\par 
\par           14    these all kind of impact on each other and
\par 
\par           15    create issues for us.
\par 
\par           16              So through 2006, as I said, we have
\par 
\par           17    assigned everything to the residential
\par 
\par           18    sector, because historically, that's where
\par 
\par           19    all these little things were.  They were
\par 
\par           20    little rooftop installations, and really the
\par 
\par           21    amount that was in some of these other things
\par 
\par           22    like transmission, re-broadcasting, and

\par 
\par 
\par            1    transportation road signs, were small.  We
\par 
\par            2    have never had any detailed data to be able
\par 
\par            3    to break it out by other sectors.
\par 
\par            4              So you could probably change this
\par 
\par            5    if you could somehow figure out how to look
\par 
\par            6    at our data for the past 20 years and break
\par 
\par            7    out the end use sector or the market sector
\par 
\par            8    depending on what you wanted -- for domestic.
\par 
\par            9    Remember, you have to do it for domestic, and
\par 
\par           10    the only way I know to do that is just to
\par 
\par           11    say, well, the foreign and domestic market
\par 
\par           12    sectors are similar, just make a heroic
\par 
\par           13    assumption.  So that's through 2006.
\par 
\par           14              Let me show you what the data
\par 
\par           15    really looks like so you can get an idea
\par 
\par           16    here.  Here is our 2005 data by market
\par 
\par           17    sector, where the sectors are industrial,
\par 
\par           18    residential, commercial, transportation,
\par 
\par           19    utility, government and other.  You can see
\par 
\par           20    that now, which is quite different from three
\par 
\par           21    or four years ago, the biggest sector is
\par 
\par           22    commercial, but remember, that's commercial

\par 
\par 
\par            1    for both exports and domestic.
\par 
\par            2              It's the whole package.  And to
\par 
\par            3    what degree can you argue that the breakdown
\par 
\par            4    is the same for domestic as opposed to
\par 
\par            5    foreign?  In fact, it's about what, 40
\par 
\par            6    percent, I guess.  It's large.  Here, we've
\par 
\par            7    broken it down by end use.  I apologize.  The
\par 
\par            8    data is a little smaller, but the end uses
\par 
\par            9    that we have are -- under electricity
\par 
\par           10    generation, we have grid interactive and
\par 
\par           11    remote, then there's end use of
\par 
\par           12    communication, consumer goods,
\par 
\par           13    transportation, water pumping, and then cell
\par 
\par           14    modules that are sold to other OEMs, and you
\par 
\par           15    can see there that grid interactive is by far
\par 
\par           16    the big winner.
\par 
\par           17              Grid interactive may mean it's a
\par 
\par           18    rooftop installation, or maybe it's central
\par 
\par           19    station installation.  It doesn't necessarily
\par 
\par           20    mean that it goes to a utility.  So another
\par 
\par           21    question that comes up is how well did we
\par 
\par           22    really know what the end use is?  I mean,

\par 
\par            1    it's being reported in our forms, but
\par 
\par            2    remember, you've got the manufacturer and he
\par 
\par            3    sells to somebody.  Okay, who is that
\par 
\par            4    somebody that he sells it to?
\par 
\par            5              The vast majority of people that
\par 
\par            6    they sell to are wholesalers.  There are very
\par 
\par            7    few -- the manufacturers do not -- even when
\par 
\par            8    they export, they do not sell to exporters.
\par 
\par            9    They sell it to a wholesaler who apparently
\par 
\par           10    then re-exports.  Now, the business is small
\par 
\par           11    enough that these guys know a lot about who
\par 
\par           12    they are selling t\ltrpar o, but as the business gets
\par 
\par           13    bigger, the market matures, and these kind of
\par 
\par           14    relationships become more mainstream
\par 
\par           15    business, there's a real question as to
\par 
\par           16    whether they really know who the end user is.
\par 
\par           17              40 percent of our production is
\par 
\par           18    exported, and here, you see the statistics
\par 
\par           19    for it.  Out of 226,000 peak kilowatts, over
\par 
\par           20    half of it is sent to wholesalers; the amount
\par 
\par           21    that is sent to end users, which is what we

\par           22    really want to know, what is the end

\par 
\par            7    used because they are putting it in, but
\par 
\par            8    wholesalers -- if they sell it to a
\par 
\par            9    wholesaler, they conceivably don't really
\par 
\par           10    know what happens to it.
\par 
\par           11              MS. KHANNA:  Can I ask another
\par 
\par           12    quick question --
\par 
\par           13              MR. MAYES:  Yes.
\par 
\par           14              MS. KHANNA:  Just for
\par 
\par           15    clarification.  So since both of the
\par 
\par           16    shipments are going to the wholesalers, your
\par 
\par           17    current breakdown into the various market
\par 
\par           18    sectors is basically determined as a
\par 
\par           19    guesstimate from what the wholesalers tell
\par 
\par           20    you, that of all that we ship, we sell so
\par 
\par           21    much goods to residential, so much goods to
\par 
\par           22    commercial?

\par 
\par            1              MR. MAYES:  No.  Let me go back, go
\par 
\par            2    back a long ways here to my grid, and point
\par 
\par            3    out -- that's a little bit too far.
\par 
\par            4              We collect information for each of
\par 
\par            5    these from the manufacturers independently.
\par 
\par            6    We have a grid that says what end use did you
\par 
\par            7    sell to?  And the manufacturer fills that in.
\par 
\par            8    We have a separate -- another grid that says,
\par 
\par            9    what is your market sector?  If we ask to try
\par 
\par           10    to cross-stratify that, the number of cells
\par 
\par           11    would get to the point that we couldn't, but
\par 
\par           12    it does create a problem for us doing the
\par 
\par           13    analysis that we want to.  Does that explain
\par 
\par           14    it?  Okay.  Now, let me get back up here
\par 
\par           15    where I was.
\par 
\par           16              MR. BLAIR:  But I think her point
\par 
\par           17    remains the same, which is the manufacturer
\par 
\par           18    doesn't really know -- that they're guessing.
\par 
\par           19              MR. MAYES:  They may well not know.
\par 
\par           20    That's correct -- so that's one of our
\par 
\par           21    issues.  Right now, starting in 2006, there
\par 
\par           22    are some big solar thermal and PV plants that

\par 
\par            1    are coming online.
\par 
\par            2              And so there are going to be major
\par 
\par            3    numbers of peak kilowatts that are being
\par 
\par            4    reported in the electricity forms 906/923,
\par 
\par            5    the generation from that, and so we've got to
\par 
\par            6    figure where to take that formula we have,
\par 
\par            7    and -- because all the new modules that are
\par 
\par            8    produced, they have to be going into those
\par 
\par            9    new units, so we don't want to double-count
\par 
\par           10    them.
\par 
\par           11              So this is really the question, how
\par 
\par           12    do we avoid double-counting of electricity if
\par 
\par           13    we estimate for the residential sector, which
\par 
\par           14    should not all be in the residential sector.
\par 
\par           15    But we've got these new PV stations coming
\par 
\par           16    on, more than 1 megawatt, so they are going
\par 
\par           17    to be in the electricity survey statistics.
\par 
\par           18    So how do we take care of this?
\par 
\par           19              Well, one way would be to take
\par 
\par           20    these few companies and send them an
\par 
\par           21    additional schedule, and just say what did
\par 
\par           22    you use?  What type of modules are you using;

\par 
\par 
\par            1    how many of them are you using, and get some
\par 
\par            2    answers.  You know, actually survey them, get
\par 
\par            3    some answers -- there aren't that many now in

\par 
\par            6    have a reliable -- so we could map them out.
\par 
\par            7    That of course means clearing a schedule,
\par 
\par            8    which for now would be sent to like 12 or 13
\par 
\par            9    people.  So that has this issues --

\par            3    understand the question.

\par

\par 
\par            8              SPEAKER:  The utilities have
\par 
\par            9    dispersed applications, right.  They have
\par 
\par           10    like a longer transmission line, sometimes
\par 
\par           11    they use -- so everything is going to
\par 
\par           12    utilities, it is not central station.  Okay.
\par 
\par           13              MR. MAYES:  Yeah.
\par 
\par           14              MS. KHANNA:  So where does central
\par

\par 
\par           16              MR. MAYES:  Central station

\par           17    facilities are utilities.
\par 
\par           18              MS. KHANNA:  Right.
\par 
\par           19              MR. MAYES:  Utilities in the sense
\par 
\par           20    of the word that we've known it for years.
\par 
\par    \ltrpar        21    There's a technical sense in which we use it
\par 
\par           22    that we don't have in EIA.  I don't want to

\par            1    get into it, but whether they're a regulated
\par 
\par            2    utility or whether they're whatever.  But I
\par 
\par            3    mean basically, yes.  A central station
\par 
\par            4    facility is -- well, it's any utility.  There
\par 
\par            5    are some industries that have such large
\par 
\par            6    applications that they have their own
\par 
\par            7    independent stations, but that's kind of

\par            8    rare.
\par 
\par            9              MS. KHANNA:  So that's the source
\par 
\par           10    of my confusion, if the central station plant
\par 
\par           11    is essentially associated with a utility, why
\par 
\par           12    is it messing up the calculation of
\par 
\par           13    residential electricity generation?
\par 
\par           14              MR. MAYES:  When we take our
\par 
\par           15    formula from the EIA-63B and we accumulate
\par 
\par           16    the peak kilowatts of module shift, there
\par 
\par           17    have been no central station generation
\par 
\par           18    plants over a megawatt in 20 years.  So we've
\par 
\par           19    looked at the production for 20 years and
\par 
\par           20    said that's all clearly going into something

\par            1              MR. MAYES:  Now, there are big
\par 
\par            2    plants that are being built that are over a
\par 
\par            3    megawatt.  They're going to come in and
\par 
\par            4    they're going to report on the 906/920, and
\par 
\par            5    their generation will be there.
\par

\par 
\par            7              MR. MAYES:  In our formula that we
\par 
\par            8    have all the modules that were sold for that
\par 
\par            9    generating plant are also down in our

\par 
\par           11              MS. KHANNA:  Then the next question
\par 
\par           12    to ask then is how many residential
\par 
\par           13    applications -- is it feasible to have a
\par

\par 
\par           18    1 megawatt -- anything that's great -- if you
\par 
\par           19    have shipment by capacity, then anything
\par

\par 
\par           20    can see, most of them go to wholesalers, and
\par 
\par           21    the wholesaler, all he is doing in this is

\par 
\par            8    the table where they record market sector, in
\par 
\par            9    one of the categories, they reported the
\par 
\par           10    utility maintenance (inaudible) and I was
\par 
\par           11    asking -- yeah, I think that's my way of
\par 
\par           12    asking is -- I understand her question to be,
\par 
\par           13    are they implicitly recording this, so that
\par 
\par           14    you're capturing that whatever the number is
\par 
\par           15    with utility, as recorded, that is what's
\par 
\par           16    going to take up the --
\par 
\par           17              MR. MAYES:  The answer is that if
\par 
\par           18    this were all domestic data, then this surge
\par 
\par           19    that I'm talking about -- you would see it
\par 
\par           20    right there.  Our problem is until the next
\par 
\par           21    data collection, we have export data -- you
\par 
\par           22    know, this is mixed export data and domestic

\par 
\par            1    data.  So we have two problems.  It's
\par 
\par            2    breaking up the sectors, and then it's
\par 
\par            3    figuring out how to do that when -- because
\par 
\par            4    we've got this 20-year history that we keep
\par 
\par            5    dragging along.
\par 
\par            6              One thing you could do is just say
\par 
\par            7    okay, once we have one or two years of data,
\par 
\par            8    we'll just use the allocation from those two
\par 
\par            9    years and say okay, domestic was this percent
\par 
\par           10    of this for these end use sectors can just
\par 
\par           11    go.  I mean that's a possibility.
\par 
\par           12              So that was a possible solution,
\par 
\par           13    and the other one is what I just mentioned
\par 
\par           14    here.  I think we've been over the -- and
\par 
\par           15    this is what we've talked about.  These
\par 
\par           16    facilities that are under a megawatt now are
\par 
\par           17    not going to be captured on the 860.
\par 
\par           18              These are the .4 to .8 megawatt
\par 
\par           19    things that are either central station or
\par 
\par           20    some other major kind of facility that are
\par 
\par           21    certainly not residential.  Now the question
\par 
\par           22    is -- they're not going to get captured by

\par            1    the electricity statistics.  So they belong
\par 
\par            2    in our formula, but our formula right now,
\par 
\par            3    we\ltrpar 're just assigning everything to one place.
\par 
\par            4    So we've got a challenge coming up.  How do
\par 
\par            5    we assign things in different categories, in
\par 
\par            6    different end use sectors?  How do we get a
\par 
\par            7    better estimate of what's in residential,
\par 
\par            8    commercial, industrial, and so forth when we
\par 
\par            9    have this problem, plus the one of our
\par 
\par           10    historical, domestic, and export data being
\par 
\par           11    put together.
\par 
\par           12              So I've already gotten to that, so
\par 
\par           13    this is kind of a summary.  Can we/should we
\par 
\par           14    attempt to modify the way we estimate our
\par 
\par           15    historical non-electricity sector -- that is
\par 
\par           16    the non-utility sector of PV generation.  I
\par 
\par           17    mean, in some sense, the obvious answer is
\par 
\par           18    yes.  It's just a matter of how.  Should we
\par 
\par           19    be collecting additional data to do that?
\par 
\par           20              And then there's the question of
\par 
\par           21    how many years of this new domestic end use
\par 
\par           22    data are we going to need before we can start

\par 
\par            7    question, can and should we?  Let's focus on
\par 
\par            8    the "should," because "can," I'm sure you can
\par 
\par            9    eventually with enough money and resources,
\par 
\par           10    right?  The "should" question is, and this is
\par 
\par           11    like you said that -- what was this, one
\par 
\par           12    percent of seven percent?  Really, is it how
\par 
\par           13    much effort do you want to spend on something
\par 
\par           14    that is such a small fraction of the big
\par 
\par           15    picture?
\par 
\par           16              And I think that's a question worth
\par 
\par           17    asking before we go into the really detailed
\par 
\par           18    formulae and surveys and things.  If we
\par 
\par           19    expect that this is going to start becoming,
\par 
\par           20    either in terms of generation a bigger

\par 
\par            1    start looking at this number, then maybe
\par 
\par            2    there's a justification; but just from the
\par 
\par            3    data that you presented --
\par 
\par            4              MR. MAYES:  It is very small.
\par 
\par            5              MS. KHANNA:  It seems hard to
\par 
\par            6    justify so much effort on something that's so
\par 
\par            7    small.
\par 
\par            8              MR. MAYES:  A partial answer to
\par 
\par            9    that is there are incentives and mandates,
\par 
\par           10    especially in the western states, that are
\par 
\par           11    creating a market for solar.  Are they going
\par 
\par           12    to create a big enough market?  I mean, some
\par 
\par           13    of the money that is being spent sounds
\par 
\par           14    immense -- when you think of the city of San
\par 
\par           15    Francisco spending -- committing to spend
\par 
\par           16    $20 million for 5 megawatts of rooftop
\par 
\par           17    installations.  I mean, or 4 megawatts.  I
\par 
\par           18    mean, that's a huge sum of money.
\par 
\par           19              In the overall electricity
\par 
\par           20    generation picture, it's not very great.  On
\par 
\par           21    the other hand, you are getting some other
\par

\par 
\par            3    be plants in Arizona, so the answer is, it's
\par 
\par            4    going to grow a lot, but even if it grows a
\par 
\par            5    lot, it's still going to be very small.  I
\par

\par 
\par            7    think the answer is solar in the long-term is
\par 
\par            8    still not expected to grow very much.

\par

\par 
\par           12    have a big percentage increase.  It may have
\par 
\par           13    a few bumps from current portfolio standards.
\par 
\par           14    I don't think anybody sees it through 2030 as
\par 
\par           15    becoming a major player.
\par 
\par           16              MS. KHANNA:  If that's true, I
\par 
\par           17    mean -- one suggestion would be to spend some
\par 
\par           18    effort, some additional effort over and above
\par 
\par           19    what you're doing, but maybe not lose sleep
\par 
\par           20    over it, because at the end of the day, it is
\par 
\par           21    still a very small fraction.  So where you

\par

\par            6              MR. GIELECKI:  This is Mark
\par 
\par            7    Gielecki.  Would this issue change if we had
\par 
\par            8    a federal portfolio standard that required
\par 
\par            9    some percentage of solar; that is -- then\ltrpar  the
\par 
\par           10    issue of accounting it would be -- even if it
\par 
\par           11    were small I think would become very
\par 
\par           12    important.
\par 
\par           13              MR. MAYES:  Yes, it would certainly
\par 
\par           14    change it.  I don't know what the exact
\par 
\par           15    forecast of cost of solar electricity is, but
\par 
\par           16    let's say it's between 20 and 30 cents per
\par 
\par           17    kilowatt-hour.  For the Congress in its
\par 
\par           18    wisdom to enact a portfolio standard that
\par 
\par           19    would raise it, would require say it even to
\par 
\par           20    be half a percent would be an amount of money
\par 
\par           21    that -- it totes up very fast, so the people
\par 
\par           22    that have done it currently and required it

\par 
\par            3    basically, they will pay what it costs.  And
\par 
\par            4    so there's no renewable federal portfolio

\par 
\par            8    react to that because I'm in New York, where
\par 
\par            9    we do have a renewable energy portfolio.  As
\par 
\par           10    far as I know, none of these renewable energy
\par 
\par           11    portfolios actually have targeted fractions
\par 
\par           12    for different sources.  In fact, all of them
\par 
\par           13    include hydro.  And they just said extra --
\par 
\par           14              SPEAKER:  It is extra.
\par 
\par           15              MS. KHANNA:  I mean in New York --
\par 
\par           16              MR. MAYES:  In Arizona and Nevada
\par 
\par           17    that I know of, they require a certain
\par 
\par           18    sub-portion of that to be solar, and in fact,
\par 
\par           19    I didn't realize until yesterday but even in
\par 
\par           20    Maryland, that they require a part of it to
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par            4    collecting that data so that they can judge
\par 
\par            5    whether the portfolio is being met?
\par 
\par            6              MR. MAYES:  That's a good question.
\par 
\par            7    I don't know the answer to that for every
\par 
\par            8    state.
\par 
\par            9              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  It makes sense
\par 
\par           10    that Arizona would be looking at signing up
\par 
\par           11    New York in hydro, but --
\par 
\par           12              MR. MAYES:  Right.
\par 
\par           13              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  You collect
\par 
\par           14    hydro data, and so we don't worry about that
\par 
\par           15    in New York so much, but what are they doing
\par 
\par           16    about collecting data down there?
\par 
\par           17              MR. MAYES:  There has to be a
\par 
\par           18    regulatory mechanism.  I don't know whether
\par 
\par           19    that translates into a public set of data or
\par 
\par           20    not.  When the plants are large, then we see
\par 
\par           21    them, but for example, they made the

\par            1    solar.  And I don't know if that was
\par

\par 
\par            3    see it, but a lot of these so far large
\par 
\par            4    facilities and responses to RPSs -- a lot of
\par 
\par            5    them are in the .4 to .8 range and we'll
\par 
\par            6    never see that.
\par 
\par            7              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  I did have one
\par 
\par            8    other point.  It would seem to me that
\par 
\par            9    everything that Neha said is right.  This is
\par 
\par           10    a small, small fraction of energy.  It may be
\par 
\par           11    in a portfolio in some states, and those
\par 
\par           12    states have not come to you and said, it will
\par 
\par           13    be down, so maybe they have been collecting
\par 
\par           14    it themselves.  And the other point you made
\par 
\par           15    of 20 to 30 cents a kilowatt-hour is darn
\par 
\par           16    high, so why would Congress mandate doing
\par 
\par           17    this?
\par 
\par           18              But the thing that might be of
\par 
\par           19    interest and probably you should monitor more
\par 
\par           20    than often is whether our power goes overseas
\par 
\par           21    and it's put into some specific end use is

\par

\par 
\par            8    real-time estimate in starting from scratch
\par 
\par            9    and working it out, and then presumably you

\par 
\par            4              MS. KHANNA:  They know it's going
\par 
\par            5    to be wrong, because now they're going to
\par 
\par            6    start getting this bigger, greater than
\par 
\par            7    1 megawatt capacity installations.  Up to now
\par 
\par            8    it was easier to assume that they were all
\par 
\par            9    going to one sector because they were all
\par 
\par           10    small.  But now they're going to actually
\par 
\par           11    show up in the electricity surveys, so you
\par 
\par           12    can't assume that all the shipments are going

\par            1    question that may help in the response.  Is

\par 
\par            3    amount of interest into this area due to an

\par

\par 
\par            7    you'll notice if you look at the Department
\par 
\par            8    of Energy Research Budget is that it's
\par 
\par            9    always, always, always favored photovoltaics.
\par 
\par           10    There's been money for
\par 
\par           11    photovoltaics -- that's been a favorite
\par

\par 
\par           13    that it's clean.  There's no -- you know,
\par 
\par           14    there's -- you put the panel up there and it
\par

\par 
\par           17    environmental effect.
\par 
\par           18              It has always, always, always
\par 
\par           19    received a lot of federal funding.  So I
\par 
\par           20    mean, the answer is, yes, it has received a
\par 
\par           21    lot of funding, and if you look at the cost
\par 
\par           22    curve, it is really very, very impressive.  I

\par 
\par           12    is running number one right now, competition

\par 
\par           20    about that, I think there are 23 homes put up
\par 
\par           21    internationally here on the Mall, and the
\par 
\par           22    constraint was 800 square feet, I believe.

\par

\par           21    that's been generated by solar.  That was

\par 
\par 
\par            1    in mind, this is a very tiny fraction of the
\par 
\par            2    total energy that's generated.  It's one
\par 
\par            3    percent of seven percent.  And I think that's
\par 
\par            4    the number to keep in mind.  I mean that runs
\par 
\par            5    down to zero if you go down to two decimal
\par 
\par            6    places; right?
\par 
\par            7              The questions that we were asked
\par 
\par            8    are there on the screen right now, that
\par 
\par            9    should we attempt to improve essentially the
\par 
\par           10    way we traditionally estimate how much
\par 
\par           11    electricity is being generated by
\par 
\par           12    photovoltaics.  If so, should we collect
\par 
\par           13    additional data using an existing survey, and
\par 
\par           14    then the big question is, because a -- I'll
\par 
\par           15    address this in a minute -- is that you have
\par 
\par           16    to separate out domestic and exported panels.
\par 
\par           17              And then the crux to the problem is
\par 
\par           18    in the manner in which the data are
\par 
\par           19    collected, and up to now, it's been quite
\par 
\par           20    reasonable because it is such a small
\par 
\par           21    fraction of the total generation, but all
\par 
\par           22    that the data will really tell us is the kind

\par            1    of solar panels that have been manufactured,
\par 
\par            2    and then where they are being sold to, and
\par 
\par            3    that cuts across different sectors, like
\par 
\par            4    whether it's commercial utility or whether
\par 
\par            5    it's on-grid or off-grid.
\par 
\par            6              But what we don't have are
\par 
\par            7    cross-classifications, for example, of all
\par 
\par            8    that's sent to residential application, we
\par 
\par            9    don't know what fraction of that went to the
\par 
\par           10    domestic market, what fraction of that went
\par 
\par           11    to the export market.
\par 
\par           12              Up to now, it's been -- in 2005,
\par 
\par           13    40 percent was actually exported, for all
\par 
\par           14    panels -- I don't remember that data
\par 
\par           15    correctly.
\par 
\par           16              So the issue becomes when we're
\par 
\par           17    trying to understand how much electricity is
\par 
\par           18    generated, up to now, most of the
\par 
\par           19    installations were less than 1 megawatt and
\par 
\par           20    it was assumed that they went primarily to
\par 
\par           21    the residential or commercial sectors as
\par 
\par           22    rooftop installations and so that was fine.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    We just think there's a formula for
\par 
\par            2    estimating the generation.
\par 
\par            3              The problem is now starting 2007
\par 
\par            4    onwards, there are plans for fairly large up
\par 
\par            5    to 64 megawatts, I heard, sized central
\par 
\par            6    station installations.  Anything that is
\par 
\par            7    greater than 1 megawatt gets picked up on an
\par 
\par            8    electricity form.  And so now there's an
\par 
\par            9    issue of double-counting.  Electricity that's
\par 
\par           10    being generated by the greater than
\par 
\par           11    1 megawatt capacity installations is going to
\par 
\par           12    be in the electricity generation, but then we
\par 
\par           13    don't know how to back that out of the
\par 
\par           14    residential, because whether the panels been
\par 
\par           15    shipped out to the wholesalers.  The
\par 
\par           16    wholesalers don't know what end use that went
\par 
\par           17    to.
\par 
\par           18              And so that's becoming the basic
\par 
\par           19    problem.  So we were asked these three
\par 
\par           20    questions -- what should we do?  And I think
\par 
\par           21    they've -- well, I think one committee member
\par 
\par           22    put it really well.  He says, "We're stumped.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    We know less that you do."  But the bottom
\par 
\par            2    line was that if this is such a small
\par 
\par            3    fraction of the overall generation, is it
\par 
\par            4    worth spending so much time and effort on
\par 
\par            5    EIA's behalf to try and improve an estimate
\par 
\par            6    that at the end is so small of the total
\par 
\par            7    generation?
\par 
\par            8              So if it is important -- for
\par 
\par            9    example, for political reasons because it
\par 
\par           10    takes a -- maybe it takes a lot of renewable
\par 
\par           11    energy portfolio.  So there's a
\par 
\par           12    possibility -- it may be an optimistic
\par 
\par           13    possibility -- of a National Renewable Energy
\par 
\par           14    portfolio.  Then these numbers will actually
\par 
\par           15    start becoming important.
\par 
\par           16              So I think the Committee's
\par 
\par           17    recommendations were, if you can through an
\par 
\par           18    existing survey, for example, collect
\par 
\par           19    additional information without too much
\par 
\par           20    additional effort, by all means do that and
\par 
\par           21    improve the estimates.  But right now, it
\par 
\par           22    does not seem that this is such a big

\par 
\par 
\par            1    problem.  I think one committee member made a
\par 
\par            2    really good point that where there are states
\par 
\par            3    where they have targeted -- I don't want to
\par 
\par            4    use the word quarter -- but targeted
\par 
\par            5    standards for solar.
\par 
\par            6              For example, I believe, Arizona is
\par 
\par            7    one of the states that has renewable energy
\par 
\par            8    portfolio where they actually targeted a
\par 
\par            9    certain fraction for solar, these states have
\par 
\par           10    got to know whether they're meeting their
\par 
\par           11    targets or not.  In order words, if they must
\par 
\par           12    be collecting some detailed information which
\par 
\par           13    EIA so far does not have, maybe we want to
\par 
\par           14    start.
\par 
\par           15              That is the first step, to find out
\par 
\par           16    where are these states which actually have
\par 
\par           17    the big solar installations; how are they
\par 
\par           18    tracking their data, and maybe just use that
\par 
\par           19    as the best estimate.  I think that was my

\par            4    working in the general area of penetration of
\par 
\par            5    solar -- and actually in Japan -- let's go
\par 
\par            6    backwards.  There's a California program
\par 
\par            7    called the Million Solar Rooftops, and
\par 
\par            8    they're just organizing to do that.  So there
\par 
\par            9    is some capability there.
\par 
\par           10              Ameril (?) does a little bit of
\par 
\par           11    this also.
\par 
\par           12              But it turns out there's been a
\par 
\par           13    subsidy program in Japan for about 10 years.
\par 
\par           14    I know a couple of people who have collected
\par 
\par           15    good data there, so you might be able to
\par 
\par           16    learn something -- experience of how to do it
\par 
\par           17    and who they get the information from, and
\par 
\par           18    how they make sure it's good data.  That is
\par 
\par           19    hard; I tried on my own to do this and I kind
\par 
\par           20    of gave up after a few weeks just trying to
\par 
\par           21    get even the data.
\par 
\par           22              Part of it is -- some of it is

\par            1    proprietary --
\par 
\par            2              MR. NEERCHAL:  Thanks.  Tom.
\par 
\par            3              MR. RUTHERFORD:  In our parallel
\par 
\par            4    session, we heard a talk by Kara Norman about
\par 
\par            5    the impact of prices on production volumes of
\par 
\par            6    propane and natural gas.  I learned in the
\par 
\par      \ltrpar       7    process -- actually in the discussion
\par 
\par            8    afterwards, I understood what the point was.
\par 
\par            9    She was very clear about what she'd done, but
\par 
\par           10    the broader picture has to do with the
\par 
\par           11    decrease in the use of heating oil leads to
\par 
\par           12    where we have oil and gas competition in
\par 
\par           13    industrial applications -- always through
\par 
\par           14    this trade-off between propane and collection
\par 
\par           15    of natural gas.
\par 
\par           16              So it's quite important overall to
\par 
\par           17    understanding the nature of connections
\par 
\par           18    between oil prices and gas prices to get it
\par 
\par           19    clear on what's going on.  Kara took a very
\par 
\par           20    straightforward approach to the problem
\par 
\par           21    looking at collecting survey data, or looking
\par 
\par           22    at the survey data which has been collected,

\par            4    components.
\par 
\par            5              Technologically, there's a choice
\par 
\par            6    about that are -- choices are being made by
\par 
\par            7    producers about how much to produce different
\par 
\par            8    products.  And she asked the question, well,
\par 
\par            9    okay, how does price affect this decision?
\par 
\par           10    And so she laid out the data, put together a
\par 
\par           11    very straightforward progression model, and
\par 
\par           12    found the model doesn't fit very well.
\par 
\par           13              So this then went back and looked
\par 
\par           14    as some correlation, and she presented us
\par 
\par           15    with sort of what the data looked like, and a
\par 
\par           16    pretty nice overview what the challenges
\par 
\par           17    were, and then her challenge to the Committee
\par 
\par           18    was, okay, well, where do we go from here,
\par 
\par           19    how do we make sense of this?  And it would
\par 
\par           20    be an ultimate goal of having some sense
\par 
\par           21    about the connection between it.  That's my

\par 
\par            1              Moshe and John took the challenge,
\par 
\par            2    and they both had -- I thought complementary
\par 
\par            3    suggestions on how to proceed.  Moshe pointed
\par 
\par            4    out at the very outset that mechanisms may be
\par 
\par            5    in place in these markets where potentially
\par 
\par            6    there are very important lags in the market
\par 
\par            7    response.  And high propane price
\par 
\par            8    differential in one period may produce a
\par 
\par            9    response that's lagged by some time or so.
\par 
\par           10              There was a very -- I thought
\par 
\par           11    concrete suggestion.  He was concerned about
\par 
\par           12    the role of contracts influencing production
\par 
\par           13    decisions.  He did caution that there's some
\par 
\par           14    danger here in multiple testing in going out
\par 
\par           15    on fishing expeditions.
\par 
\par           16              I thought that's a technical term
\par 
\par           17    in statistics; right?  Because this is
\par 
\par           18    problematic.  He did suggest -- then he made
\par 
\par           19    a number of methodological suggestions which
\par 
\par           20    I didn't understand.
\par 
\par           21              So that was -- I thought the
\par 
\par           22    statistical suggestions were good and

\par 
\par 
\par            1    encouraging.  John, being very pragmatic,
\par 
\par            2    suggested some more -- investigative
\par 
\par            3    reporting was his technical term.  He just
\par 
\par            4    says, okay, where does the propane come from
\par 
\par            5    and where does it go?  He's actually been
\par 
\par            6    around the AmeriGas trucks outside of Santa
\par 
\par            7    Cruz making deliveries to resorts and
\par 
\par            8    expensive homes.
\par 
\par            9              So he suggests the idea that demand
\par 
\par           10    may be less than price-responsive.  We have a
\par 
\par           11    market where the demand for propane may be
\par 
\par           12    from people for whom that's a very small
\par 
\par           13    fraction of their income.  They are willing
\par 
\par           14    to pay a lot.  They know the weather is
\par 
\par           15    changing.  He also suggested to understand
\par 
\par           16    structural characteristics in the market, the
\par 
\par           17    idea that there could be capacity constraints
\par 
\par           18    maybe having effect, which I don't understand
\par 
\par           19    why things are moving around a lot.
\par 
\par           20              He also noted that there's a
\par 
\par           21    classic identification problem.  If you are
\par 
\par           22    looking at both demand and supply, if you are

\par 
\par 
\par            1    just looking at the supply response, things
\par 
\par            2    can be confused.  So these are some
\par 
\par            3    suggestions there.  Other things more sort of
\par 
\par            4    mundane like looking at whether -- maybe
\par 
\par            5    hurricanes may have something to do with
\par 
\par            6    things -- this is also all useful.
\par 
\par            7              And so I thought overall that the
\par 
\par            8    main thrust, I think -- and Nagaraj pointed
\par 
\par            9    out that the cost of extraction is also
\par 
\par           10    problematic here, that the supply responses
\par 
\par           11    may be -- and he also advocated the use of
\par 
\par           12    lags to see if that might correct.
\par 
\par           13              So overall, I think that the
\par 
\par           14    Committee's response was to try to be
\par 
\par           15    encouraging, that yeah, this can be kind of
\par 
\par           16    messy and hard to do things, but that in
\par 
\par           17    response to the problem, if the data doesn't
\par 
\par           18    line up exactly like the textbook tells you
\par 
\par           19    it should, your response should be to dig a
\par 
\par           20    little deeper to know what's going on.
\par 
\par           21              And now that I understand what the

\par 
\par           10    question.  I wasn't there, and I only glanced
\par 
\par           11    through this.  They had 15 da\ltrpar ta points, that
\par 
\par           12    was kind of around a regression.  And yet
\par 
\par           13    that covers a period of 1996 to 2006 --
\par 
\par           14              MS. NORMAN:  I noticed that this
\par 
\par           15    morning, and I even questioned -- how did --
\par 
\par           16              MR. WEINIG:  Kara, would you speak

\par 
\par           19              MS. NORMAN:  I was just agreeing.
\par 
\par           20    I looked at that this morning -- of all the
\par 
\par           21    things to not notice in the months that I've
\par 
\par           22    been working on the project and presentation.

\par            1    In the research, what he is talking about is
\par 
\par            2    a model that I came across in my research.
\par 
\par            3              And in my bullets, I have a list, a
\par 
\par            4    little description of it.  And one of the
\par 
\par            5    bullets says there were 15 observations from
\par 
\par            6    1996 to 2006, and I don't know exactly how
\par 
\par            7    they are spread out because there's 10 years
\par 
\par            8    and 15 observations.  So that's something
\par 
\par            9    that I might need to go back and check.  I
\par 
\par           10    might have my dates off or I might have the
\par 
\par           11    number of observations off.
\par 
\par           12              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  But they also
\par 
\par           13    have it by the month and region.  Therefore,
\par 
\par           14    there should be almost some panel data here
\par 
\par           15    that you get a lot more observations.
\par 
\par           16              MS. NORMAN:  Yeah, it's slightly
\par 
\par           17    different.  Some of the data that you are
\par 
\par           18    looking at is data that I was using in my
\par 
\par           19    analysis.  The data that they were using for
\par 
\par           20    that -- for the model that they -- they are
\par 
\par           21    currently using, is different.  They are

\par 
\par            4              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  The second point
\par 
\par            5    I had was that if it really is this
\par 
\par            6    fractionation, as the real issue here,
\par 
\par            7    wouldn't a linear programming model do a lot
\par 
\par            8    better than a regression model?
\par 
\par            9              MS. NORMAN:  That was something
\par 
\par           10    that was brought up in the comments.
\par 
\par           11              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Okay, fine.
\par 
\par           12              MS. NORMAN:  Yeah -- the
\par 
\par           13    optimization and that's something that we
\par 
\par           14    talked about and we need to talk about maybe
\par 
\par           15    going to the gas producers themselves and
\par 
\par           16    asking, okay, what kind of model do you use
\par 
\par           17    to do this?  And more than likely, you are
\par 
\par           18    right, it probably is an optimization
\par 
\par           19    technique.

\par            1              One announcement I left out or I
\par 
\par            2    should have made it in the beginning, that
\par 
\par            3    I'm supposed to officially inform you that
\par 
\par            4    for your information and under the terms of
\par 
\par            5    DoE grant to ASA, Nancy may chair, but must
\par 
\par            6    attend each meeting, and she is authorized to
\par 
\par            7    adjourn the meeting if she determines this to
\par 
\par            8    be in the public interest.
\par 
\par            9              So I know maybe you'll try to take
\par 
\par           10    some of the comments back if you had known
\par 
\par           11    this earlier.
\par 
\par           12              Anyway, I'm supposed to make this
\par 
\par           13    for the transcript.  She must approve all the
\par 
\par           14    meetings of the advisory committee and every
\par 
\par           15    agenda.  Also, she may designate a substitute
\par 
\par           16    in her absence.  And on that, one side note
\par 
\par           17    is that against -- this is also somewhat
\par 
\par           18    confirmed rumor that she, Nancy, is

\par 
\par            1    legislation for this?  I thought the
\par 
\par            2    California rates committee sort of -- what is
\par 
\par            3    it, American Statistical Association,
\par 
\par            4    Congress, EIA?
\par 
\par            5              MS. KHANNA:  That's a good
\par 
\par            6    question, because it's changed over the life
\par 
\par            7    of the Committee.  Early on, this was the
\par 
\par            8    Committee under FACA, which was the Federal
\par 
\par            9    Advisory Committee Act.  But a couple of
\par 
\par           10    years ago, the Department of Energy's general
\par 
\par           11    counsel decided that this is not exactly a
\par 
\par           12    FACA committee.  And the reason is members
\par 
\par           13    are appointed by the President of ASA, not
\par 
\par           14    us, and because you give us advice, but you
\par 
\par           15    don't have to give us consensus advice.
\par 
\par           16              You are all free to give us as many
\par 
\par           17    different ideas as you think of.  And so now
\par 
\par           18    it's not under FACA, there's some nice -- so
\par 
\par           19    this -- the fact that I'm the designated
\par 
\par           20    federal official is really from FACA.  But
\par 
\par           21    we're not under FACA anymore.  But we also
\par

\par 
\par            5    on climate change.  It took three months for

\par 
\par           14    would allow her to retire.

\par 
\par            9    Some years ago, I learned how to use
\par 
\par           10    spellcheck.  And it worked so well
\par 
\par           11    electronically that I got used to it, and
\par 
\par           12    then a while back, I was writing something
\par 
\par           13    longhand expecting that it would correct
\par 
\par           14    itself.  It just seemed appropriate.
\par 
\par           15              But then on the break, just to show
\par 
\par           16    you that this can be extended even further,
\par 
\par           17    one of your colleagues suggested that he had
\par 
\par           18    a misspeak.  I won't get into it, but maybe
\par 
\par           19    at lunch if you come for lunch you will fess

\par 
\par            3    several years leaned towards staying at a
\par 
\par            4    George Washington University Inn rather than

\par 
\par            9    handy, because it's just a few steps to the
\par 
\par           10    Metro and a few steps.  You can always go
\par

\par 
\par           20    had leaned towards some more expensive

\par            6    remaining hard in one direction or the other,
\par 
\par            7    please feel free to mention that to Nancy or
\par 
\par            8    me.
\par 
\par            9              MR. FEDER:  Another consideration
\par 
\par           10    is one time we had a very nice place, nice
\par 
\par           11    food, but it was impossible to hold a
\par 
\par           12    conversation.  I think -- to me, two
\par 
\par           13    important attributes would be the seating
\par 
\par           14    arrangement and the noise level.  And as I'm
\par 
\par           15    aging, my hearing is declining, and so the
\par 
\par           16    benefit out of the -- being there because we
\par 
\par           17    can have nice food also where we are.  But to
\par 
\par           18    have this opportunity to talk to colleagues
\par 
\par           19    is important.  So --
\par 
\par           20              MR. NEERCHAL:  Thank you.  And I
\par 
\par           21    think one other thing I can bring up.  You
\par 
\par           22    know, we have some people stepping down from

\par            1    the Committee.  We have to constantly supply
\par 
\par            2    new names to the ASA president.  So any time
\par 
\par            3    you think of someone who would be appropriate
\par 
\par            4    for this committee, just send a note to
\par 
\par            5    Nancy, or Bill, or me, so we can kind of keep
\par 
\par            6    that list of names ready, because we got this
\par 
\par            7    e-mail from the ASA president, especially the
\par 
\par            8    new president.  They want to really jump on
\par 
\par            9    things -- and I need another name in two
\par 
\par           10    weeks, that kind of thing.  So it will be
\par 
\par           11    nice to have some names in our list.
\par 
\par           12              MR. FEDER:  Just in this context,
\par 
\par           13    you know my boss is stepping in as the next
\par 
\par           14    president of the ASA.  Sally Morton was
\par 
\par           15    elected.  She is our president.
\par 
\par           16              SPEAKER:  She will have things to
\par 
\par           17    work.
\par 
\par           18              MR. FEDER:  But actually, next year
\par 
\par           19    she is president-elect.  I mean ASA has like,
\par 
\par           20    this president-elect and president-elect in
\par 
\par           21    waiting and that president-elect -- past

\par            4              MS. KHANNA:  Actually, the request
\par 
\par            5    is probably coming from Sally.
\par 
\par            6              MR. FEDER:  Sorry?
\par

\par 
\par            9              MR. NEERCHAL:  The coordinator or

\par           10    something.
\par 
\par           11              MS. KHANNA:  Yes.
\par 
\par           12              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  I would
\par 
\par           13    underscore what he said by having a place
\par 
\par           14    where you could -- I too have the same

\par 
\par           17              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Anyway, having a
\par 
\par           18    place where we could converse is probably a
\par 
\par           19    little bit more important than that $30 limit
\par 
\par           20    in my view.  I may not be in line with other

\par 
\par 
\par            1    there was one place where the tables were
\par 
\par            2    small, and so you actually got to talk to two
\par 
\par            3    or three people, but maybe for this committee
\par 
\par            4    it's nice to have an opportunity to have at

\par 
\par            6              MR. WEINIG:  Well, this is a story,
\par 
\par            7    not a rebuttal.  Nancy and I went to the
\par 
\par            8    place that you speak of and checked it out at
\par 
\par            9    lunchtime.  It was quiet.  It was so quiet we
\par 
\par           10    wondered if the place would stay in business
\par 
\par           11    long enough for us to have a committee
\par 
\par           12    meeting.  And we got over there, and it was a
\par 
\par           13    singles bar.  I mean, in the evening, that
\par 
\par           14    grew out of an almost-abandoned place at
\par 
\par           15    lunchtime.  So we have to be more careful on
\par 
\par           16    our data collection.
\par 
\par           17              MS. NORMAN:  And going at the
\par 
\par           18    appropriate time --
\par 
\par           19              MR. FEDER:  That's what we call
\par 
\par           20    seasonality; right?
\par 
\par           21              MR. WEINIG:  I think lunch is

\par 
\par            5    comparison of several different

\par

\par

\par 
\par            9    Preston McDowney with the Statistics and
\par 
\par           10    Methods Group, and today I'm going to be
\par 
\par           11    talking about comparison of  suppression
\par 
\par           12    software.
\par 
\par           13              Just as a background, the
\par 
\par           14    disclosure limitation team which I worked on
\par 
\par           15    was formed at the direction of the EIA
\par 
\par           16    Strategic Plan Goal 4 Committee.  One of our
\par 
\par           17    directives was to recommend software that
\par 
\par           18    could be used at EIA to protect our sensitive
\par 
\par           19    survey data.
\par 
\par           20              My presentation is going to discuss
\par 
\par           21    two programs that use the network flow-based
\par 
\par           22    cell suppression.  And Ramesh after me, he's

\par 
\par 
\par            1    going to have an interesting talk about
\par 
\par            2    non-disclosure methods, upon which network
\par 
\par            3    flow cell suppression is just one of.  So I'm
\par 
\par            4    going to talk about programs to give us Ws in
\par 
\par            5    our tables; he's going to talk about
\par 
\par            6    alternatives to Ws to our tables.  So if you
\par 
\par            7    fall asleep during my presentation, you might
\par 
\par            8    well wake up for his.
\par 
\par            9              Our evaluation process was simple.
\par 
\par           10    We took two programs that were publicly
\par 
\par           11    available, DiAna, which was developed by the
\par 
\par           12    Census Bureau about 1991, and Tau-Argus,
\par 
\par           13    which was developed by Statistics
\par 
\par           14    Netherlands.
\par 
\par           15              We can demo that for you off the
\par 
\par           16    Internet.  However, to use it, you have to
\par 
\par           17    purchase one of two linear programming
\par 
\par           18    softwares, Ciplex or Express.  For both
\par 
\par           19    programs, we use the P% rule as our rule for
\par 
\par           20    suppression.  We use the same petroleum data
\par 
\par           21    for both programs, and after we got the
\par 
\par           22    suppression patterns, we used the disclosure

\par            2    different initiative to see if we could crack
\par 
\par            3    the patterns that the programs gave us.
\par 
\par            4              Ramesh and I chose both the same
\par 
\par            5    table.  This is the table structure.  It's a
\par 
\par            6    three-dimensional table.  It's one of the
\par 
\par            7    more complicated tables that we have here at
\par 
\par            8    EIA.  The thought is if it can protect this
\par 
\par            9    table, it will pretty much be able to do
\par 
\par           10    anything that we need it to do.
\par 
\par           11              The first dimension is geography.
\par 
\par           12    There's 51 states, with Washington being
\par 
\par           13    included -- five districts and several
\par 
\par           14    subdistricts.
\par 
\par           15              The second dimension is
\par 
\par           16    formulation.  This is gasoline formulation.
\par 
\par           17    We show here a formula that's also oxygenated
\par 
\par           18    and conventional, so the table kind of goes
\par 
\par           19    on and on and on.
\par 
\par           20              The third dimension is cell type,
\par 
\par           21    and we have cells to end users and we have

\par            1    end users, it is broken out into two separate
\par 
\par            2    categories.  We're showing one category here
\par 
\par            3    and the total, and then for cells for resale,
\par 
\par            4    we are showing the three subcategories and
\par 
\par            5    I'm not showing the total, but just to make
\par 
\par            6    the slide look nice so that we can see
\par 
\par            7    everything.
\par 
\par            8              Also, while we are here, I wanted
\par 
\par            9    to show you that for the state Of Virginia,
\par 
\par           10    it is the only state in the subdistrict that
\par 
\par           11    has any reformulated data whatsoever.  Now,
\par 
\par           12    on the left, the cell for end users, that
\par 
\par           13    data is not sensitive, so we can publish
\par 
\par           14    Virginia and we can publish the subtotal.
\par 
\par           15    But if you look at cells for resales, there's
\par 
\par           16    some withheld data there.
\par 
\par           17              And if you look at the bulk,
\par 
\par           18    because we can't publish Virginia's and it's
\par 
\par           19    the only state in that subdistrict, we also
\par 
\par           20    can't publish the subdistrict total, which
\par 
\par           21    make sense.  Now, at the far end of the
\par 
\par           22    table, we have the total cells.  So for all

\par            1    the formulations, the ones we don't show.
\par 
\par            2    And as you can see, there's data for all the
\par 
\par            3    rest of the states except for lower Virginia,
\par 
\par            4    it's the only state with bulk sales. (?)
\par 
\par            5              So even in a total category, we had
\par 
\par            6    to suppress Virginia still, and we had to
\par 
\par            7    suppress the subdistrict total still all the
\par 
\par            8    way into the table at totals.  And I'll show
\par 
\par            9    you why -- I'll use this example later in the
\par 
\par           10    presentation.

\par           11              Some of the non-monetary factors
\par 
\par           12    that we looked at in evaluating these
\par 
\par           13    programs, there's a long list here and you
\par 
\par           14    can see them in your handouts.  I highlighted
\par 
\par           15    "Ease of Use" because that's the only one
\par 
\par           16    that I'm going to touch on in this
\par 
\par           17    presentation.
\par 
\par           18              So what did the programs do?  How
\par 
\par           19    did they perform?  Well, Tau-Argus suppressed
\par 
\par           20    quite a few more cells than DiAna did, 228
\par 
\par           21    versus 226.  Now, we kind of would expect
\par 
\par           22    that both programs would identify the same

\par 
\par            2    a little bit discrepancy and we looked into
\par 
\par            3    that.  I have some suspicions of what
\par 
\par            4    happened there.
\par 
\par            5              But the interesting thing is how
\par 
\par            6    many cells failed to audit.  Now, for
\par 
\par            7    Tau-Argus, 12 of the 228 failed to audit.
\par 
\par            8    However, none of those were sensitive or
\par 
\par            9    primary cells that we wanted to protect.  So
\par 
\par           10    questions?
\par 
\par           11              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Can you say what
\par 
\par           12    failing audit means?
\par 
\par           13              MR. McDOWNEY:  Okay.  The audit
\par 
\par           14    program looks at the suppression pattern, and
\par 
\par           15    it tries to figure out what range of values
\par 
\par           16    the cell that's being withheld can take.  If
\par 
\par           17    it can figure out that range closer than we
\par 
\par           18    feel comfortable with -- say we want to
\par 
\par           19    protect the cell within 10 percent, so if the
\par 
\par           20    value of the cell is 100, if the program can
\par 
\par           21    tell the values between 90 -- it's greater
\par 
\par           22    than 90 and less than 110, they'd fail the

\par 
\par            6              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  You have 12
\par 
\par            7    additional cells that --
\par 
\par            8              MR. McDOWNEY:  There were 12 cells
\par 
\par            9    that were suppressed that the program was
\par 
\par           10    able to determine the range of that value
\par 
\par           11    within specs that we didn't like.
\par 
\par           12              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Oh, okay.
\par 
\par           13              MR. FEDER:  Preston, all those
\par 
\par           14    cells that DiAna suppressed were also
\par 
\par           15    suppressed by Tau-Argus, or are there some
\par 
\par           16    ways that one --
\par 
\par           17              MR. McDOWNEY:  There are
\par 
\par           18    differences in the patterns, yes, and I'm
\par 
\par           19    going to highlight a major difference in the
\par 
\par           20    next slide.
\par 
\par           21              Now, DiAna suppressed far less

\par           22    cells.  However, most cells failed to audit,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    and we actually had a situation where four
\par 
\par            2    sensitive cells did fail the audit.  That
\par 
\par            3    situation I showed you with Virginia a few
\par 
\par            4    slides ago, where Virginia's data showed up
\par 
\par            5    on various parts of the table -- wasn't
\par 
\par            6    exactly Virginia and I cheated a little bit
\par 
\par            7    with that slide to make it come out that way.
\par 
\par            8    But that's the scenario that it was.  It was
\par 
\par            9    the same state value that failed in multiple
\par 
\par           10    places in the table.
\par 
\par           11              Question?
\par 
\par           12              SPEAKER:  No.
\par 
\par           13              MR. McDOWNEY:  As we were looking
\par 
\par           14    at the results, one of the striking things
\par 
\par           15    that just jumped out at us was that Tau-Argus
\par 
\par           16    had a tendency to suppress more totals,
\par 
\par           17    whether it's regional totals, or
\par 
\par           18    reformulation totals, or cells type totals.
\par 
\par           19    And in that particular order, you can see
\par 
\par           20    that Tau-Argus in one category had suppressed
\par 
\par           21    about twice as many totals, and the second
\par 
\par           22    about three times as many totals, and in the

\par 
\par 
\par            1    third almost six times as many totals.  So
\par 
\par            2    the answer to most of these questions, they
\par 
\par            3    did pick different cells.
\par 
\par            4              As a summary of the programs,
\par 
\par            5    talking abou\ltrpar t ease of use and to summarize
\par 
\par            6    what we just talked about, DiAna doesn't have
\par 
\par            7    a user-friendly interface.  It's essentially
\par 
\par            8    a Fortran program that's been compiled and
\par 
\par            9    runs as an executable program in DOS.
\par 
\par           10              So there's no frills to it
\par 
\par           11    whatsoever; it is what it is.  It requires
\par 
\par           12    very specific file formats.  When you look at
\par 
\par           13    your microdata, you have to externally
\par 
\par           14    aggregate your microdata to the table.  It
\par 
\par           15    has to be in a very specific format.  The
\par 
\par           16    first three lines of the code has to be one
\par 
\par           17    way, so forth and so on.  And all that has to
\par 
\par           18    transpire before DiAna will suppress the
\par 
\par           19    pattern.  But the good thing about that is it
\par 
\par           20    can be automated.
\par 
\par           21              So if you have a production cycle
\par 
\par           22    like we do at EIA, you just call this

\par 
\par            1    program; it drops the files back into a
\par 
\par            2    program where they can be picked up for your
\par 
\par            3    production mode.  It tends to suppress fewer
\par 
\par            4    cells, complementary, and it also suppresses
\par 
\par            5    the marginal totals.  However, as we saw in a
\par 
\par            6    few slides, it didn't adequately protect all
\par 
\par            7    of your cells.
\par 
\par            8              Tau-Argus has a user-friendly
\par 
\par            9    interface.  It's actually kind of pretty if
\par 
\par           10    you look at it.  It is menu-driven and you
\par 
\par           11    have to click boxes and you do everything
\par 
\par           12    through a series of menus and stuff.  And it
\par 
\par           13    constructs the table internally.  So you kind
\par 
\par           14    of point Tau-Argus -- you import the
\par 
\par           15    microdata and you tell it okay, I want
\par 
\par           16    regional to be one dimension; I want
\par 
\par           17    formulation to be another dimension, and I
\par 
\par           18    want this to be the third dimension.
\par 
\par           19              And it aggregates the table for you
\par 
\par           20    and it does everything right there.  But the
\par 
\par           21    problem is, that's difficult to automate.  If

\par           11              Tau-Argus has other algorithms to
\par 
\par           12    determine when the Ws will appear in the
\par 
\par           13    table, and we can evaluate those.  DiAna
\par 
\par           14    doesn't have that capability.  We can also
\par 
\par           15    evaluate the change in a protection criteria
\par 
\par           16    by changing the P% instead of determining
\par 
\par           17    different levels of protection that we want
\par 
\par           18    on a table -- and we could evaluate both the
\par 
\par           19    programs by changing the cost functions
\par 
\par           20    inside the programs to determine how it
\par 
\par           21    selects its complementary cells, so that we
\par

\par 
\par            6    I know I have breezed through that one slide,
\par 
\par            7    but are there any other elements that we
\par 
\par            8    should be considering for our criteria in the
\par 
\par            9    listings of the slides?  And as data users,
\par 
\par           10    how would you recommend that we balance the
\par 
\par           11    number of suppressed cells versus the number
\par 
\par           12    of marginal totals?  If you suppress more
\par 
\par           13    cells, you would get rid of more information,
\par 
\par           14    but hit the totals, then you are dealing with
\par 
\par           15    the numbers that you can actually show.  With
\par 
\par           16    that, do you want to have questions now, or
\par 
\par           17    do you want to go into --
\par 
\par           18              MS. KHANNA:  I think we should have
\par 
\par           19    questions for Preston first and then we'll
\par 
\par           20    let Ramesh talk and questions for Ramesh, and
\par 
\par           21    we can free-for-all on both of them.  So any
\par 
\par           22    questions for Preston?

\par 
\par            1              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  The basic
\par 
\par            2    question is, in my mind, if you do not
\par 
\par            3    suppress a cell, is this a serious problem
\par 
\par            4    that you should have suppressed?  Is this a
\par 
\par            5    serious problem to the Agency?  In other
\par 
\par            6    words, is it going to jeopardize the data
\par 
\par            7    collection process?  Because promised
\par 
\par            8    confidentiality is part of it.  Or is it
\par 
\par            9    going to jeopardize the -- be an economic
\par 
\par           10    cost to some private firm, by which it may
\par 
\par           11    redound to the agencies through some sort of
\par 
\par           12    suit or stop-order or something like that?
\par 
\par           13              MR. FEDER:  I think -- I actually
\par 
\par           14    do statistical disclosure limitation more on
\par 
\par           15    microdata files, and we are currently talking
\par 
\par           16    about moving towards tabular data disclosure
\par 
\par           17    that Preston and Ramesh are talking about.
\par 
\par           18    And I saw that one of you are -- I think, are
\par 
\par           19    more closer with Larry Clarks (?), who is
\par 
\par           20    maybe the best-known person in this area.
\par 
\par           21    And my client is now interested in some

\par 
\par 
\par            1    analysis systems, which have their own
\par 
\par            2    issues.
\par 
\par            3              So I thought a lot about it and I
\par 
\par            4    think the number one issue is not even -- it
\par 
\par            5    is that law.  And it's -- even what cost
\par 
\par            6    would you put on that.  So that's one thing,
\par 
\par            7    but we've seen a decline in response rates in
\par 
\par            8    many surveys in many countries, and I think
\par 
\par            9    it partially has to do with people\ltrpar  being
\par 
\par           10    concerned about the confidentiality of the
\par 
\par           11    reports that are given.
\par 
\par           12              So I think the cost is not just in
\par 
\par           13    one particular instance; it's in general.
\par 
\par           14    And as I heard someone once say, all it takes
\par 
\par           15    is one case.  Imagine that is publicized in
\par 
\par           16    Washington Post about EIA producing
\par 
\par           17    confidential information that was given under
\par 
\par           18    the pledge of confidentiality, what the
\par 
\par           19    damage would be.  So it's ethical, it's
\par 
\par           20    practical, it's legislative.
\par 
\par           21              MS. KHANNA:  It hasn't happened.

\par            3    But the problem is it could, and you don't
\par 
\par            4    know what will happen.
\par 
\par            5              MR. McDOWNEY:  Just as a kind
\par 
\par            6    of -- cells that should've been suppressed as
\par 
\par            7    a sensitive cell, we can check that because
\par 
\par            8    we can -- we know its sister cells are easy
\par 
\par            9    to identify.  There's less of them.  What
\par 
\par           10    this program is looking at is really how well
\par 
\par           11    do you do -- not missing cells that should've
\par 
\par           12    been suppressed, but how well do you protect
\par 
\par           13    the cells that are suppressed.
\par 
\par           14              MR. DANDEKAR:  Can I say something,
\par 
\par           15    sir?  I think I understand your question.
\par 
\par           16    Basically, I'm guessing Tau-Argus identified
\par 
\par           17    certain cells as sensitive which are not same
\par 
\par           18    for DiAna, same number.  At EIA, we have our
\par 
\par           19    guidelines.  We use P% rule with less
\par 
\par           20    than -- which we run through the tabular data
\par 
\par           21    and figure out which cells are sensitive.
\par 
\par           22    Tau-Argus did the same thing, but they have

\par 
\par 
\par            1    slightly different procedure.  They use what
\par 
\par            2    is called shadow variable, and I realize that
\par 
\par            3    what they identify as a sensitive cell, that
\par 
\par            4    counts slightly different from what we
\par 
\par            5    identify as a sensitive cell.
\par 
\par            6              We need to coordinate our efforts
\par 
\par            7    with the Europeans to see exactly why we get
\par 
\par            8    those different number of sensitive cells.
\par 
\par            9    But we are sticking to our standards and
\par 
\par           10    using those to make sure that we take care of
\par 
\par           11    sensitive cells and identify them internally
\par 
\par           12    as sensitive, and try to give them enough
\par 
\par           13    protection required by the law.
\par 
\par           14              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  But this brings
\par 
\par           15    up the counterquestion.  What happens if you
\par 
\par           16    over-suppress?  In other words, in an effort
\par 
\par           17    to make sure that you suppress all sensitive
\par 
\par           18    cells, you occasionally suppress some cells
\par 
\par           19    that you didn't have to suppress.  And
\par 
\par           20    therefore, why not just run the program to
\par 
\par           21    both DiAna and Tau in sequence and get them

\par 
\par            8              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  The cost of not
\par 
\par            9    suppressing something is high.  One type of
\par 
\par           10    error has a very high cost, so I'm asking the
\par 
\par           11    question, what's the cost of making an error
\par 
\par           12    in the other direction?
\par 
\par           13              MS. KHANNA:  The cost is to users.
\par 
\par           14    The users have less data unless you suppress
\par 
\par           15    it.

\par           18    whether to suppress a cell or a marginal.
\par 
\par           19    And my question is, suppose that you opted

\par 
\par            5    get an estimate for --
\par 
\par            6              MR. FEDER:  No, no, no, but EIA
\par 
\par            7    sent that response to request full data
\par 
\par            8    or -- maybe there's some other publication
\par 
\par            9    that has that information.
\par 
\par           10              MS. KHANNA:  It wouldn't be in any
\par 
\par           11    of our submissions to the IEA either, and we
\par 
\par           12    wouldn't give them the number if it was
\par 
\par           13    sensitive, even if it was a complementary
\par 
\par           14    suppression.
\par 
\par           15              MR. FEDER:  If the marginals were
\par 
\par           16    annual totals and the cells were monthly
\par 
\par           17    totals by type of fuel or something like
\par 
\par           18    that, and decided to keep the cell and
\par 
\par           19    suppress the marginal.
\par 
\par           20              I guess that was the question,
\par

\par            1    not the case.  I don't know.
\par 
\par            2              MS. KHANNA:  Not in the EIA
\par 
\par            3    publications.  Because if we had a suppressed
\par 
\par            4    value, we would not release it anywhere.
\par 
\par            5              MR. DANDEKAR:  That seems to be the
\par 
\par            6    problem for -- that seems to be the problems
\par 
\par            7    for the Europeans, because the Eurostat gets
\par 
\par            8    the data from all its satellite countries,
\par 
\par            9    and for them -- and later on they combine all
\par 
\par           10    good data and publish it.  And for them, it
\par 
\par           11    is important that the individual country
\par 
\par           12    suppress internal cell -- and I got marginal.
\par 
\par           13    That way, tables can be combined into one big
\par 
\par           14    gigantic table without causing the
\par 
\par           15    disclosure.  But that's the probl\ltrpar em with
\par 
\par           16    Eurostat, and they are trying to get around
\par 
\par           17    that.  At EIA, we do not have that problem.
\par 
\par           18              MS. KHANNA:  The trouble of
\par 
\par           19    disclosure limitation is the number of
\par 
\par           20    suppressed cells is going to be different for
\par 
\par           21    every product that you use.  It's just not an
\par 
\par           22    exact science, and you can change it a little

\par            1    bit by changing the objective function or the

\par

\par

\par 
\par            6              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  But it seems
\par 
\par            7    that the Tau product identifies more cells
\par 
\par            8    that it thinks should be suppressed.  But you
\par 
\par            9    can tweak the DiAna so that it could catch
\par 
\par           10    all of the same cells?
\par 
\par           11              MS. KHANNA:  Well, not all the same
\par 
\par           12    ones.  I don't think they'll ever get exactly
\par 
\par           13    the same ones.

\par 
\par           16              MR. DANDEKAR:  We have to remember
\par 
\par           17    it's a two-step procedure.  First step is to
\par 
\par           18    identify in the table which cells are
\par 
\par           19    sensitive.  Okay?  And our objective is to
\par 
\par           20    protect the sensitive cells.
\par 
\par           21              Now, how we protect it, that is up
\par 
\par           22    to us to decide.  DiAna does it one way.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    Tau-Argus does it other way.  And only thing
\par 
\par            2    they want to do is to protect sensitive
\par 
\par            3    cells.  I can use one set of complementary
\par 
\par            4    suppressions.  DiAna can use other set of
\par 
\par            5    complementary suppression.  If Nancy has her
\par 
\par            6    own software, she can use third set of
\par 
\par            7    complementary cell suppression.  So it's a
\par 
\par            8    choice, okay?  And there are a lot of
\par 
\par            9    different ways you can develop complementary
\par 
\par           10    cell suppression pattern.  There's no one way
\par 
\par           11    of doing it.
\par 
\par           12              MS. KHANNA:  And each of those
\par 
\par           13    three ways might be fine in terms of the
\par 
\par           14    overall objective, which is to protect the
\par 
\par           15    sensitive cells.  So you can have three or
\par 
\par           16    four different possible -- or you can have a
\par 
\par           17    zillion possible suppression patterns, each
\par 
\par           18    one of which might be just fine.  You
\par 
\par           19    certainly wouldn't want to do all of them or
\par 
\par           20    you wouldn't get any data out.
\par 
\par           21              So the question is how do you

\par 
\par            4    back.  You said you identified the cells that
\par 
\par            5    you think should be suppressed by some
\par 
\par            6    standard --

\par 
\par            8    that's where the disclosure potential is.
\par 
\par            9              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  So when you
\par 
\par           10    showed the number of cells that were
\par 
\par           11    identified by each program, was it picking up
\par 
\par           12    all of those cells that you had previously --
\par 
\par           13              MR. DANDEKAR:  That is correct,
\par 
\par           14    sensitive cell, but the choice of
\par 
\par           15    complementary suppression, because -- say
\par 
\par           16    just consider one dimensional table, one cell
\par 
\par           17    is sensitive, and because the marginal value
\par 
\par           18    is published, we have to separate it --
\par 
\par           19              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  No, I understand
\par 
\par           20    that.
\par 
\par           21              MR. DANDEKAR:  So that which other

\par

\par

\par 
\par           13    important data items in my table.  So then
\par 
\par           14    you have to go back and do something --

\par

\par 
\par           13    The reason I'm considering these four
\par 
\par           14    different methods I'm using is Classical
\par 
\par           15    LP-based cell suppression method, which is
\par 
\par           16    used at Statistics Canada for a long time,
\par 
\par           17    since mid-'80s.  It was originally developed
\par 
\par           18    by Gordon Sande.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    are the suppression methods, and they have
\par 
\par            2    been used for extensive time.
\par 
\par            3              The next one is a LP-based
\par 
\par            4    synthetic tabular data, or CTA method, which
\par 
\par            5    I introduced to the ADL researchers back in
\par 
\par            6    1997, and first wrote the paper back in 2001.
\par 
\par            7    And this -- CTA, I introduced it back then as
\par 
\par            8    an alternative to a microdata level noise
\par 
\par            9    addition method, because I thought, back
\par 
\par           10    then, that microdata level noise addition
\par 
\par           11    method to predict tabular data was not
\par 
\par           12    exactly guaranteed a protection to the
\par 
\par           13    sensitive cell, and there was a potential for
\par 
\par           14    over-suppression or over-connection to the
\par 
\par           15    good data.  So that was the idea back then.
\par 
\par           16              In my analysis, I have used P%
\par 
\par           17    Rule, and I'm using the P% 10 percent rule.
\par 
\par           18    And my objective here -- I've been working in
\par 
\par           19    the statistical disclosure area for over 10
\par 
\par           20    years now, and my observation is that survey
\par 
\par           21    managers and survey operation staff is
\par 
\par           22    familiar with different types of tables

\par           16    own decision, and that's the objective of
\par 
\par           17    this study.
\par 
\par           18              First, this controlled tabular
\par 
\par           19    adjustment, basically, it's a two-step
\par 
\par           20    procedure.  In the first step, changes are
\par 
\par           21    made to the sensitive cell values by
\par 
\par           22    sufficient amount to limit statistical

\par 
\par 
\par            1    disclosure, and in the second step, these
\par 
\par            2    non-sensitive values are adjusted minimally
\par 
\par            3    to restore the original additive table
\par 
\par            4    structure.
\par 
\par            5              I highlighted here "minimally" by
\par 
\par            6    different color, because it's kind of a
\par 
\par            7    subjective criteria.  You can have different
\par 
\par            8    kind of objective functions and decide how to
\par 
\par            9    balance the table again.
\par 
\par           10              This particular slide shows how the
\par 
\par           11    noise meter works.  Basically what they do is
\par 
\par           12    to put a certain percentage of the noise
\par 
\par           13    around a base value which is shown here by a
\par 
\par           14    plus or minus -- this 10 percent, "a" equal
\par 
\par           15    to represent that, and then I'm using the
\par 
\par           16    normal distribution, abnormal distribution
\par 
\par           17    with standard deviation of .005 for this
\par 
\par           18    study, but this basically -- it give the feel
\par 
\par           19    for how the noise is introduced in the
\par 
\par           20    microdata level and then how the tables are
\par 
\par           21    created.
\par 
\par           22              I used the same table Preston used,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    which I call first table.  And I realize that
\par 
\par            2    it can be linked logically to another table.
\par 
\par            3    The first table, the one Preston used has
\par 
\par            4    volumes by grade, sales type and PAD
\par 
\par            5    district; that's a regional thing.  And the
\par 
\par            6    second table is volume by formulation, sales
\par 
\par            7    type and by regional characteristics.
\par 
\par            8              Here in both these tables, the
\par 
\par            9    variables which are not common are by grade
\par 
\par           10    for the first table, and for the second table
\par 
\par           11    the formulation is kind of unique, so that's
\par 
\par           12    where the links take place.  I populated that
\par 
\par           13    table -- a template -- again, this detailed
\par 
\par           14    table structure with synthetic data is
\par 
\par           15    available to all the researcher on the
\par 
\par           16    website.  I populated this link table with
\par 
\par           17    1,000 synthetic microdata records containing
\par 
\par           18    six variables.
\par 
\par           19              The synthetic data generator I used
\par

\par            1    this data I have created, like only -- last
\par 
\par            2    couple of months, I created a 40-dimensional
\par 
\par            3    table using the same synthetic data
\par 
\par            4    generator, and the Europeans are trying to
\par 
\par            5    test those tables right now for this
\par 
\par            6    statistical disclosure control.
\par 
\par            7              In our case, the four categorical
\par 
\par            8    variables again are related to the regional
\par 
\par            9    thing, which is 50 states plus District of
\par 
\par           10    Columbia.  There are three grade types, three
\par 
\par           11    sales types, and three formulation types.
\par 
\par           12    And then associated with these three
\par 
\par           13    categorical variables, there's one magnitude
\par 
\par           14    variable and one sampling weight variables,
\par 
\par           15    and that's how all those 1,000 synthetic
\par 
\par           16    microdata are created.  And I used those to
\par 
\par           17    populate that table template.
\par 
\par           18              I'm not going to -- because of

\par 
\par           20    the intermediate steps, but what I found

\par 
\par            1    suppression method basically suppresses
\par 
\par            2    altogether 294 suppressions.  That includes
\par 
\par            3    the 78 sensitive cells.  The network flow
\par 
\par            4    method uses altogether 479 suppressions,
\par 
\par            5    including 79 sensitive cells.
\par 
\par            6              Both methods, I realize that fully
\par 
\par            7    protects sensitive cells based on the audit.
\par 
\par            8    By that, I mean if you find out lower and
\par 
\par            9    upper bound on suppressed cells, they are
\par 
\par           10    comfortably beyond plus/minus 10 percent
\par 
\par           11    range which I have been using for this study.
\par 
\par           12              One thing I realized that for
\par 
\par           13    network-flow model, there were three exact
\par 
\par           14    disclosures but all three of those were
\par 
\par           15    complementary cells, so basically, general
\par 
\par           16    practice has been those cells need not be
\par 
\par           17    suppressed in the production mode, they can
\par 
\par           18    be released for the publication.

\par 
\par           21              MR. DANDEKAR:  Altogether, I

\par 
\par            4              I did the similar comparison for
\par 
\par            5    these two different method for perturbation:
\par 
\par            6    One is CTA and other is noise.  I tried to
\par 
\par            7    show the -- for the controlled tabular
\par 
\par            8    adjustment and for the noise, the overall
\par 
\par            9    quality of the information published can be
\par 
\par           10    measured as a percentage accuracy or

\par           12    values.
\par 
\par           13              Here, I'm identifying -- in case of
\par 
\par           14    the CTA, I have different ranges for the
\par 
\par           15    errors, 10 different categories, and I'm
\par 
\par           16    showing sensitive cells separately from the
\par 
\par           17    non-sensitive cells.  For this study, I'm
\par 
\par           18    using 1 percent error or less as acceptable
\par 
\par           19    error for publication purpose, and

\par           20    considering good cells as good quality cells.
\par 
\par           21              And based on that statistics, I see

\par 
\par            3    (inaudible) because of the quality concern.
\par 
\par            4    Using the same criteria for the noise, I
\par 
\par            5    realize that one percent or less, there are
\par 
\par            6    only 633 good quality cells, and the rest can
\par 
\par            7    be considered as a poor quality and might not

\par

\par 
\par           13    might decide to use 5 percent cutoff or

\par 
\par            3    adjustment fix minimal changes to the
\par 
\par            4    non-sensitive cells overall, but the noise
\par 
\par            5    spread is kind of distributed with the actual
\par 
\par            6    changes, and the activity of historical view
\par 
\par            7    of how two different methods work -- this is
\par 
\par            8    for a non-sensitive cell.
\par 
\par            9              For the sensitive cells, this is

\par

\par 
\par           12    I have to play with these parameter for the
\par 
\par           13    noise and the standard deviation to make sure
\par 
\par           14    that I give exactly the same kind of
\par 
\par           15    protection to the sensitive cells given by

\par           16    the CTA method.
\par 
\par           17              With CTA, you can give exactly the

\par            8    by methods that change the data slightly,
\par 
\par            9    such as controlled tabular adjustment or
\par 
\par           10    noise, or will you like to have protection by
\par 
\par           11    suppression, where some of the cells are
\par 
\par           12    withheld for publication?
\par 
\par           13              Second question is, what are the
\par 
\par           14    issues that EIA should consider as we try to
\par 
\par           15    come up with common approach to protecting
\par 
\par           16    tabular data?
\par 
\par           17              And the last one, if EIA wants to
\par 
\par           18    begin using data perturbation methods or the
\par 
\par           19    adjustment methods such as controlled tabular
\par 
\par           20    adjustments or noise, how should EIA inform
\par 
\par           21    users that data have been changed?
\par 
\par           22              I guess that's about it.

\par            1              MR. HILL:  Questions?
\par 
\par            2              MR. BLAIR:  Ed Blair.  I don't have
\par 
\par            3    a comment regarding number one.  I do, I
\par 
\par            4    think, have opinions regarding number two,
\par 
\par            5    and those are as follows.
\par 
\par            6              It's not issues per se; it'\ltrpar s really
\par 
\par            7    the -- it's at a very macro level.  It seems
\par 
\par            8    to me that from an agency point of view, you
\par 
\par            9    don't necessarily want to reinvent the wheel,
\par 
\par           10    you're potentially looking for -- I'm trying
\par 
\par           11    to think of a diplomatic way to say sort of
\par 
\par           12    cover your rear end.  Essentially, you're
\par 
\par           13    looking for a defendable course of action.
\par 
\par           14              And it seems to me that a
\par 
\par           15    defendable course of action is to say who
\par 
\par           16    within the U.S. government is going to be our
\par 
\par           17    standard bearer?  Who's got best practices in
\par 
\par           18    this regard in terms of data protection?  Is
\par 
\par           19    that the Census Bureau; is it Bureau of Labor
\par 
\par           20    Statistics.  Whoever it is, we're going to
\par 
\par           21    follow their system.  And yeah, we're smart

\par 
\par            3    be able to fall back on that.
\par 
\par            4              But sort of an adjunct position
\par 
\par            5    that strikes me on this is that if there's
\par 
\par            6    not already in place a response plan or a
\par 
\par            7    crisis plan for public relations regarding
\par 
\par            8    potential breaches of data security,
\par 
\par            9    disclosure issues, possibly there should be.
\par 
\par           10    So in a sense, I'm not talking to you,
\par 
\par           11    Preston and Ramesh, maybe I'm talking to you,
\par 
\par           12    Nancy.
\par 
\par           13              I previously served on the Census
\par 
\par           14    Advisory Committee, they had a big flap, I'm
\par 
\par           15    thinking within the past three years -- my
\par 
\par           16    memory is getting so bad.  They had a big
\par 
\par           17    flap where maybe it was -- for example, when
\par 
\par           18    Congress had asked them to provide
\par 
\par           19    information on Arab-Americans living in the
\par 
\par           20    United States.  And then it hit the press
\par 
\par           21    that they have provided that data, and then
\par 
\par           22    this brought into play the whole question of

\par 
\par 
\par            1    how closely guarded were Census data; were
\par 
\par            2    they prepared to provide information on
\par 
\par            3    individuals to law enforcement agencies.  And
\par 
\par            4    protestations notwithstanding, that became a
\par 
\par            5    big issue.
\par 
\par            6              And what became clear out of that
\par 
\par            7    was, whenever something like this takes
\par 
\par            8    place, and if you think about -- if it is the
\par 
\par            9    Arab-American thing I was thinking about, one
\par 
\par           10    of things -- nobody's specific information
\par 
\par           11    had been passed over.  The data is protected
\par 
\par           12    by law.  But there was a misimpression.  And
\par 
\par           13    so the -- in this case, citizen communities
\par 
\par           14    getting all up in arms over this impression,
\par 
\par           15    adjunct citizen communities -- all of a
\par 
\par           16    sudden this became a big issue within the
\par 
\par           17    Hispanic community.  Wait a minute, you know,
\par 
\par           18    I mean if them, why not us?
\par 
\par           19              Somebody needs to have sort of a

\par 
\par           21    that were to come up, who is designated to

\par            1    this, but who is designated to talk to media,

\par

\par 
\par            4    what the methods are, what the recovery
\par 
\par            5    methods are.  I don't know.  I'm kind of
\par 
\par            6    losing focus here.  This I think is something
\par 
\par            7    that possibly the agency should consider
\par 
\par            8    having in place.
\par 
\par            9              MR. FEDER:  I want to refer to some
\par 
\par           10    of the things, but first I want to say, when
\par 
\par           11    the things comes and then we remember who
\par 
\par           12    your clients are, think about who your
\par 
\par           13    clients are before you answer these
\par 
\par           14    questions, and -- but before I say that, I
\par 
\par           15    want to mention that unlike Census, the data
\par 
\par           16    the EIA is concerned with is a very
\par 
\par           17    heterogeneous population with some very big
\par 
\par           18    entities and some very small.  The issues are
\par 
\par           19    quite different.
\par 
\par           20              A lot of the techniques that Census
\par 
\par           21    is developing I think apply to more of human
\par 
\par           22    populations where you have less

\par 
\par 
\par            1    homogeneity (?) except, of course for income
\par 
\par            2    and variables like that.  So there's some
\par 
\par            3    methodology that might be different here.
\par 
\par            4    But coming back to the previous point, if you
\par 
\par            5    need to decide between suppression of cells
\par 
\par            6    or doing -- I mean, that's the question
\par 
\par            7    Ramesh posed -- or doing some kind -- adding
\par 
\par            8    some noise to the data, and the question that
\par 
\par            9    Preston asked earlier, would you suppress
\par 
\par           10    something marginal or a cell?
\par 
\par           11              In both cases, my answer would be
\par 
\par           12    keep in mind who might be using it, and if
\par 
\par           13    this is the same audience I am thinking
\par 
\par           14    about, I would protect the marginal and
\par 
\par           15    suppress the cell, and I would add noise and
\par 
\par           16    not suppress the cell if I can do that.
\par 
\par           17              And caution the user the treatment
\par 
\par           18    had been applied to the data.  Why?  Because
\par 
\par           19    a lot of times, the exact value is
\par 
\par           20    important -- but any value, which the purpose
\par 
\par           21    it might be -- and let's not forget that
\par 
\par           22    there are lot of noises in the data either

\par 
\par 
\par            1    because of the coding error or data quality,
\par 
\par            2    editing and imputation, non-response, and so
\par 
\par            3    on and so forth.  We know savvy users know
\par 
\par            4    that the data are never precise.  So I would
\par 
\par            5    add the noise but keep the data.
\par 
\par            6              And the same, why would I keep the
\par 
\par            7    margin on another cell?  Because sometimes
\par 
\par            8    you can have workarounds if you know the
\par 
\par            9    marginal value -- and so the dependence that
\par 
\par           10    they take that\ltrpar  cross product, or do something
\par 
\par           11    like that, compute a value, fit some
\par 
\par           12    regression model to the marginals and then
\par 
\par           13    input it this way.  So this way, I'm trying
\par 
\par           14    to answer both questions, and trying to do it
\par 
\par           15    while thinking who might be needing the data.
\par 
\par           16              There are experts of disclosure in
\par 
\par           17    an area that I'm interested in: Larry Cox,
\par 
\par           18    Bill Winkler.  I think Paula Weir had some
\par 
\par           19    issues, she's with EIA.  She has some
\par 
\par           20    interest in that area, and others.  Of
\par 
\par           21    course, you too have a lot of knowledge.  So
\par 
\par           22    that's many, many experts in this difficult

\par 
\par 
\par            1    problem.
\par 
\par            2              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Several
\par 
\par            3    comments.  Number one is the Census, just as
\par 
\par            4    in individuals, they do the survey of
\par 
\par            5    manufacturing and so forth.  So in that
\par 
\par            6    sense, there's a similarity.  I would go with
\par 
\par            7    that -- and the people who've been worrying
\par 
\par            8    about this problem for years, although they
\par 
\par            9    haven't solved it completely yet, is the
\par 
\par           10    Census Bureau.  And therefore, I think it's
\par 
\par           11    the DiAna, which was one of their products.
\par 
\par           12              But something you didn't mention
\par 
\par           13    heavily here is -- but you did mention -- was
\par 
\par           14    production.  You got to have a method that
\par 
\par           15    will enable you to call programs and produce
\par 
\par           16    in tabulated data.  I think DiAna -- from
\par 
\par           17    what you've said in the stuff I read before
\par 
\par           18    and what you said here, DiAna's a hands-down
\par 
\par           19    winner for that one.
\par 
\par           20              The other thing I go back to, is
\par 
\par           21    protection the most important element, or is
\par 
\par           22    data users the most important element?  And I

\par 
\par            1    know you're trying to balance this.  But
\par 
\par            2    there's got to be one that you think is the
\par 
\par            3    most critical and that should help you weigh
\par 
\par            4    which way you err, if you're going to err.
\par 
\par            5              And finally, I want to make this
\par 
\par            6    observation, that having done chemical market
\par 
\par            7    research years ago in another life, most of
\par 
\par            8    the data that you have is archival data and
\par 
\par            9    it isn't worth much to current commercial
\par 
\par           10    interests, because things change so fast in
\par 
\par           11    industry, that you can tell me, yes, they had
\par 
\par           12    50 employees and they produced 5,000 barrels
\par 
\par           13    of distillate a week at this plant.
\par 
\par           14              But so what?  That was two years
\par 
\par           15    ago.  What are they doing today is more of
\par 
\par           16    interest of me.  And I can't mine that out of
\par 
\par           17    your data, because you don't even know it
\par 
\par           18    yet.  So honestly, I think the biggest
\par 
\par           19    problem is going to be what Moshe said to
\par 
\par           20    begin with, that it will cause response rate

\par           12              Stan Friedman from EIA.  We
\par 
\par           13    actually, this year, with the redesign of the
\par 
\par           14    electricity forms which you have heard about
\par 
\par           15    historically, offered up a policy which we
\par 
\par           16    got a lot of pushback from the industry, and
\par 
\par           17    that was the release of sensitive or

\par

\par            1    eight-month or a nine-month period of time,

\par 
\par            3    hard on not releasing that information.  So
\par 
\par            4    at least for the time being, we decided not
\par 
\par            5    to do that.  But that was one approach that
\par 
\par            6    EIA had considered.  That was both on volume
\par 
\par            7    and on price information.  So just as an

\par           10              MR. GIFFORD:  Hi, Will Gifford,
\par 
\par           11    EIA.  I've got a few questions.  One was,
\par 
\par           12    Preston, you mentioned that there was -- I
\par 
\par           13    think -- I can't remember which one was
\par 
\par           14    which -- Tau-Argus and DiAna found -- one
\par 
\par           15    found 49 and one found 46 primary
\par 
\par           16    suppressions.  Is that correct?
\par 
\par           17              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  That's correct.
\par 
\par           18              MR. GIFFORD:  I'm not understanding
\par 
\par           19    how -- because I don't think my understanding
\par 
\par           20    of primary suppressions is that it should be
\par 
\par           21    particularly a difficult problem to find.
\par 
\par           22    And I think that's kind of worrisome to me

\par 
\par 
\par            1    that there would any kind of trouble.  Yes.
\par 
\par            2              MR. DANDEKAR:  In fact, I noticed
\par 
\par            3    that problem about three or four years ago.
\par 
\par            4    I realized that Tau-Argus does not work
\par 
\par            5    properly.  Whenever they have the rates
\par 
\par            6    associated with the microdata, what I did,
\par 
\par            7    first I fed in weights, weighted data, it
\par 
\par            8    gave me different results from DiAna.  So I
\par 
\par            9    separated the weight.
\par 
\par           10              If weight was three, I created
\par 
\par           11    three separate record with same values, and I
\par 
\par           12    got exactly the same result as DiAna.  Okay,
\par 
\par           13    so there is a problem with Tau-Argus.
\par 
\par           14              Just want you to be aware of that.
\par 
\par           15              MR. GIFFORD:  Another question was,
\par 
\par           16    i\ltrpar f we went to CTA or noise method, just
\par 
\par           17    wondering -- comments on historical
\par 
\par           18    comparisons -- I'm wondering if there's a way
\par 
\par           19    to go from the current complementary
\par 
\par           20    suppression to convert our published tables
\par 
\par           21    to CTA or noise tables, so that -- or whether
\par 
\par           22    that's not possible if we decided to go with

\par            1    a different methodology.
\par 
\par            2              MR. DANDEKAR:  Are you talking
\par 
\par            3    about difference in the batch you were doing
\par 
\par            4    the complementary suppression, and in the
\par 
\par            5    future, if we decide to switch to noise and
\par 
\par            6    controlled tabular adjustment.
\par 
\par            7              Is that your question?
\par 
\par            8              MR. GIFFORD:  Let's say we got a
\par 
\par            9    table -- a 2006 table that we decide, all
\par 
\par           10    right, we're going to go for it, we're going
\par 
\par           11    to go CTA.  Can we republish old tables with
\par 
\par           12    a different -- that maybe instead of -- that
\par 
\par           13    just had, you know --
\par 
\par           14              MR. DANDEKAR:  Ws?
\par 
\par           15              MR. GIFFORD:  Ws.
\par 
\par           16              Could we redo it?
\par 
\par           17              MR. DANDEKAR:  In fact, that was
\par 
\par           18    what we proposed back in 1995.  I don't know,
\par 
\par           19    Nancy, if you remember this thing.  That was
\par 
\par           20    a idea originally floated around by Gordon
\par 
\par           21    Sande.  Any time you do the cell suppression,
\par 
\par           22    Ws, you can get the estimate for doing Ws;

\par 
\par 
\par            1    okay.  And if you --
\par 
\par            2              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Actually, the
\par 
\par            3    audit software that they talk about does give
\par 
\par            4    you an estimate for the suppressed block.  It
\par 
\par            5    gives you a range of estimates.  And a
\par 
\par            6    (inaudible) estimate shows the average of the
\par 
\par            7    upper and the lower bound that it gives you.
\par 
\par            8    So yeah, we talked about publishing -- in
\par 
\par            9    fact, they always -- the surround is it
\par 
\par           10    published the upper and lower bounds of the
\par 
\par           11    suppressed cell instead of -- because you
\par 
\par           12    could get that if you have the audit
\par 
\par           13    software.  I mean, that's basically
\par 
\par           14    information you've provided with your table.
\par 
\par           15    You just haven't told customers how to get
\par 
\par           16    it.
\par 
\par           17              MR. GIFFORD:  Right, right.
\par 
\par           18              MS. KIRKENDALL:  So that was an
\par 
\par           19    option -- most agencies don't really want to
\par 
\par           20    publish upper and lower bounds for suppressed
\par 
\par           21    cells, you really expand the number of
\par 
\par           22    numbers you have to give; they weren't sure

\par 
\par 
\par            1    that people would understand that.  So you
\par 
\par            2    could do something to publish numbers from
\par 
\par            3    the tables of withheld values.  You know, you
\par 
\par            4    have to work through the process.  But it's
\par 
\par            5    possible to do something.
\par 
\par            6              MR. GIFFORD:  Then one final
\par 
\par            7    question would be for -- so if we did CTA
\par 
\par            8    tables or noise adjustment tables, how would
\par 
\par            9    our -- how would we handle our mirror tables
\par 
\par           10    that we published with CVs for all the cells?
\par 
\par           11    It wouldn't be same -- I know it's not
\par 
\par           12    sampling error really, but it's something
\par 
\par           13    that I'm not sure the users would really know
\par 
\par           14    what to do with.
\par 
\par           15              MR. DANDEKAR:  Which of these do
\par 
\par           16    you mean?
\par 
\par           17              MS. KIRKENDALL:  EME.
\par 
\par           18              MR. DANDEKAR:  EME.  So he's
\par 
\par           19    talking about, I guess, makes kind (?)
\par 
\par           20    survey.  Yeah, so I guess when you develop
\par 
\par           21    the controlled tabular adjustment on the
\par 
\par           22    noise strategy, you had to first take into

\par           10    that sampling characteristics associated with
\par 
\par           11    your survey.  And take into account RAC and
\par 
\par           12    not make over-adjustment, because when you
\par 
\par           13    make the over-adjustment, basically you are
\par

\par 
\par           18    One is -- you know, forgive me if I
\par 
\par           19    understand this incorrectly.  I'm thinking
\par 
\par           20    that basically you have -- you start with a
\par 
\par           21    table, you've got cells that -- you know,
\par 
\par           22    maybe there's one power plant in that

\par 
\par            1    jurisdiction that reports, so if you punch in
\par 
\par            2    information for that cell, you just publish
\par 
\par            3    the information about that power plant.  So
\par 
\par            4    that's a problem, so you suppress things, or
\par 
\par            5    you fuzz it, but you suppress, you know?
\par 
\par            6              But then, as soon as you start
\par 
\par            7    publishing marginals, if only one piece of
\par 
\par            8    information is missing, you've said this
\par 
\par            9    (inaudible) one piece of information is
\par 
\par           10    missing, you can throw what that piece of
\par 
\par           11    information is, and now you have to hide
\par 
\par           12    another piece of information so that you can
\par 
\par           13    figure out what the missing piece of
\par 
\par           14    information -- but really all you cared about
\par 
\par           15    protecting was that original piece of
\par 
\par           16    information.
\par 
\par           17              When you talk about the cells
\par 
\par           18    that -- I forget what it is -- fail the
\par 
\par           19    audit.  When you talk about those, how often
\par 
\par           20    is that the original protected cell, and how
\par 
\par           21    often is the cell that failing the audit one

\par

\par 
\par            6    getting in.
\par 
\par            7              MR. DANDEKAR:  If you find out the
\par 
\par            8    cell which failed the audit's a sensitive
\par 
\par            9    cell, your option is to go and manually find
\par 
\par           10    out which additional cell needs to be
\par 
\par           11    suppressed, suppress it and run the audit
\par 
\par           12    again and see whether that cell is protected
\par 
\par           13    or not.  That's doing it -- if the table is
\par 
\par           14    simple, that is easy to do.
\par 
\par           15              At Census, what they do is they
\par 
\par           16    have different kind of a software.  They will
\par 
\par           17    use it only for that particular cell which
\par 
\par           18    does not get the protection, and protect
\par 
\par           19    additional cells, and run the audit again and
\par 
\par           20    make sure the cell is protected.  If it is
\par 
\par           21    not, they keep going into that cycle.

\par

\par 
\par            3    that automatically.  That is the reason it is
\par 
\par            4    recommended software such as what it gives

\par 
\par            6    theme or the DiAna should be followed by
\par 
\par            7    audit program.  It should be integrated
\par 
\par            8    procedure.  And that's how you make sure that
\par 
\par            9    you're protecting, giving enough protection
\par 
\par           10    to the sensitive cells.
\par 
\par           11              MR. BLAIR:  In any case, it seems
\par 
\par           12    to me that it's almost an impossible problem
\par 
\par           13    that -- okay, so you suppress everything
\par 
\par           14    great, everybody's confidentiality is good.
\par 
\par           15              But the reason you published the
\par 
\par           16    information in the first place is because
\par 
\par           17    you're trying to help inform decisions,
\par 
\par           18    you're mandated to do so.  And it's probably
\par 
\par           19    not possible to get a perfect resolution
\par 
\par           20    there.
\par 
\par           21              What is possible is certainly to

\par            1    resolution.  But what is possible is to get
\par 
\par            2    defendable resolution.  So I keep coming back
\par 
\par            3    to, in a sense, what's defendable.  And then
\par 
\par            4    speaking to the comment that Ed made, in a
\par 
\par            5    sense, why do we care?  Well, we care, as
\par 
\par            6    Moshe said, because we're honestly trying to
\par 
\par            7    fulfill our legal requirements.  We care for
\par 
\par            8    ethical reasons.
\par 
\par            9              But maybe we care for practical
\par 
\par           10    reasons, because if people thought we weren't
\par 
\par           11    good stewards of their data, they simply
\par 
\par           12    wouldn't apply the data, or we wouldn't have
\par 
\par           13    to worry about adding noise to the data
\par 
\par           14    because they will have added noise to the
\par 
\par           15    data for us.  And in that regard, that's not
\par 
\par           16    necessarily an issue of what -- whether
\par 
\par           17    technically, a particular observation could
\par 
\par           18    be identified, could be inferred.  That's
\par 
\par           19    really kind of a perceptual issue.
\par 
\par           20              This is where I come back -- apart
\par 
\par           21    from sort of the technical question of doing
\par

\par 
\par 
\par            1    comes sort of a metaquestion of, what if
\par 
\par            2    there is an event that causes people in the
\par 
\par            3    industry to call into question our
\par 
\par            4    stewardship of the data?  We need to be
\par 
\par            5    prepared to respond to that, which is really
\par 
\par            6    separate from the technical question.
\par 
\par            7              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  I have a very
\par 
\par            8    quick one.  This system of suppressing, let's
\par 
\par            9    say the sister cell to the sensitive cell,
\par 
\par           10    does it only suppress one, or can it be
\par 
\par           11    dialed so it suppresses two so that allows
\par 
\par           12    one to report marginals in many cases?
\par 
\par           13              MR. DANDEKAR:  Let me give you, in
\par 
\par           14    the mathematical term -- in N dimensional
\par 
\par           15    table, if there's one sensitive cell, you
\par 
\par           16    need two to the power N minus one
\par 
\par           17    complemented separation --
\par 
\par           18              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  You can adjust
\par 
\par           19    so it does that.
\par 
\par           20              MR. DANDEKAR:  Correct.  So now,
\par 
\par           21    which N minus one you select, it's kind of
\par 
\par           22    subjective using different criteria.

\par 
\par            2    question was, Ed raised the point, how do we
\par 
\par            3    know that the data isn't pre-noise stuff, as
\par 
\par            4    it were; pre-smeared, fuzzy?  You don't know
\par 
\par            5    that, do you?  Or do you resample?
\par 
\par            6              MR. DANDEKAR:  No, this is where
\par 
\par            7    the industry expert comes into play; okay?
\par 
\par            8    Industry experts, they have the knowledge,
\par 
\par            9    the quality of the data, which cells are
\par 
\par           10    important from the point of view of
\par 
\par           11    publication, which cells the quality is poor
\par 
\par           12    because of the sampling-related problem and
\par 
\par           13    all that.
\par 
\par           14              So the person -- like, say, I'm
\par 
\par           15    tasked to develop the cell separation
\par 
\par           16    pattern, I cannot work in isolation, I have
\par 
\par           17    to work -- team up with the industrial
\par 
\par           18    expert, share my expertise with him or her,
\par 
\par           19    and have to have some kind of a mutual
\par 
\par           20    exchange.
\par 
\par           21              I have seen that in the past, I
\par 
\par           22    thought some -- two cells were protected, but

\par 
\par 
\par            1    the industry experts will say, hey, based on

\par 
\par \ltrpar            3    I can figure out what that cell value is.  So
\par 
\par            4    that kind of exchange is very important.
\par 
\par            5              MR. HILL:  I was a bit surprised in
\par 
\par            6    some of the cases at the number of cells that
\par 
\par            7    were suppressed.  But if it's going to be two
\par 
\par            8    to the N, and as N becomes large, you'll end
\par 
\par            9    up suppressing a lot.  So I don't think I'd
\par 
\par           10    like to receive a table.
\par 
\par           11              MR. DANDEKAR:  Table
\par 
\par           12    dimensionality.
\par 
\par           13              MR. HILL:  Yeah.  So as the
\par 
\par           14    dimension goes up, the number of suppressed
\par 
\par           15    cells increases very rapidly.
\par 
\par           16              MR. DANDEKAR:  And keep in mind, in
\par 
\par           17    the past, we used to have paper publications,
\par 
\par           18    basically two-dimensional table -- that's
\par 
\par           19    piece of paper.  But now in the internet era,
\par 
\par           20    we can have very high-dimensional table.  And
\par 
\par           21    so the problem is going to be very
\par 
\par           22    challenging, and we have to be prepared for

\par 
\par            2              And the problem with this, as the
\par 
\par            3    table dimensionality increases, it increases
\par 
\par            4    the sparsity of the table; too many
\par 
\par            5    structural zeroes.  And if you use the
\par 
\par            6    conventional suppression methods, too many
\par 
\par            7    cells are suppressed.  So suppression becomes
\par 
\par            8    impractical.  That's where you have to either
\par 
\par            9    switch to the noise, or the controlled
\par

\par 
\par           16    agency have any plan.  But slowly we have to
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par            3    example, it shows that with the CTA method,
\par 
\par            4    you don't really have to change most cells by
\par 
\par            5    very much.
\par 
\par            6              The change is mostly less that
\par 
\par            7    1 percent.
\par 
\par            8              MR. DANDEKAR:  Yeah.  I have put
\par 
\par            9    this entire table, populated it with the data
\par 
\par           10    protected by all different methods; it's on
\par 
\par           11    the website.  You can look at it.  And you
\par 
\par           12    will realize that when you use noise and the
\par 
\par           13    table dimensionality increases, noise gets
\par 
\par           14    out of hand, you cannot control it.
\par 
\par           15              And numbers, the quality goes down
\par 
\par           16    very fast.  But that does not happen with the
\par 
\par           17    controlled tabular adjustment.  Using the

\par 
\par           11    period, you suppress one cell; next period

\par

\par 
\par            9    of the -- to be frank with you, I have a
\par 
\par           10    problem with the noise from the very
\par 
\par           11    beginning, when I was introduced to you back
\par 
\par           12    in 1997.  T\ltrpar he Census' logic is that when you
\par 
\par           13    have the weighted data, weight and noise
\par 
\par           14    combined, plus multiple records, multiple

\par

\par 
\par           17    That does not happen when you go to the

\par 
\par            3    number of record -- large number of microdata
\par 
\par            4    in a given cell, they theoretically assume
\par 
\par            5    that it cancels it out.
\par 
\par            6              MR. FEDER:  You need to add more
\par 
\par            7    noise, clearly.  But if you are just trying
\par 
\par            8    to protect a few uniques (?) you mix little
\par 
\par            9    more.  You're right, if the number of
\par

\par 
\par           11    same as the dimensionality and almost anybody
\par

\par 
\par           15              MR. NEERCHAL:  They just call the

\par 
\par           17    software, they can -- you can write in any
\par 
\par           18    language you want, you pack it into an
\par 
\par           19    object, and then you can just call it -- it
\par 
\par           20    is like an assumption.  So you have

\par 
\par           20    within tables.  There's a general problem
\par 
\par           21    that if too much data are presented, that
\par 
\par           22    some of the information is sensitive, and so

\par 
\par 
\par            1    you can generally derive the -- I would think
\par 
\par            2    the subject that the data used to look at.
\par 
\par            3    Two programs were discussed: one DiAna, and
\par 
\par            4    one Tau-Argus.
\par 
\par            5              There was an attempt to try correct
\par 
\par            6    parens (?) within tables; a three-dimensional
\par 
\par            7    table was given initially with variables
\par 
\par            8    throughout the field -- geography, sales, and
\par 
\par            9    totals.  Some of the cells failed to auto
\par 
\par           10    audit, so there were some problems with some
\par 
\par           11    of the analysis.  The two programming
\par 
\par           12    languages were compared, for DiAna -- my
\par 
\par           13    summary was that that was not user-friendly,
\par 
\par           14    while in the FORTRAN, there were no specific
\par 
\par           15    formats that were used, it tends to be -- it
\par 
\par           16    tends to suppress fewer cells.
\par 
\par           17              For Tau-Argus it was user-friendly.
\par 
\par           18              The tradeoff was, you mentioned
\par 
\par           19    it's a point-and-click procedure -- the
\par 
\par           20    trade-off was that even though it was
\par 
\par           21    user-friendly, it became difficult to use in
\par 
\par           22    an automatic way, so that's the t\ltrpar radeoff

\par            2    about the change in the percentage of the
\par 
\par            3    cost function used in Tau-Argus, so there are

\par 
\par            7              From the discussion, there was some
\par 
\par            8    question about the cost of suppression that
\par 
\par            9    the issue of the -- we were given an example
\par 
\par           10    where if one piece of sensitive information
\par 
\par           11    is given out, the problem may be a cascading
\par 
\par           12    set of problems with one piece of information
\par 
\par           13    that comes out of -- and the industry doesn't
\par 
\par           14    like it, the public maybe is unhappy with it,
\par 
\par           15    and so that's perhaps a large problem.
\par 
\par           16              There was also discussion here that
\par 
\par           17    there should perhaps be a policy within play
\par 
\par           18    if it turns out there's sensitive
\par 
\par           19    information.  I think there was a couple of

\par

\par            1    presentation.
\par 
\par            2              Ramesh Dandekar looked at cell
\par 
\par            3    suppression going back to -- he has an
\par 
\par            4    example going back to 1997, since the staff
\par 
\par            5    as a rule were familiar with the table as
\par 
\par            6    what they were unfamiliar with the routines,
\par 
\par            7    but they were not familiar with how the two
\par 
\par            8    different routines compared.  So the purpose
\par 
\par            9    of this was just to compare those routines.
\par 
\par           10              He did it with a fairly large -- I
\par 
\par           11    guess -- the four-dimensional table seemed
\par 
\par           12    like a fairly large table, as you move up, we
\par 
\par           13    worked with a number of over a thousand cells
\par 
\par           14    and worked with a large -- and that's a
\par 
\par           15    relatively large table, and suggested two
\par 
\par           16    routines: one in which you suppress cells,
\par 
\par           17    and a second in which you change or add noise
\par 
\par           18    to the cell values.  And it had a couple of
\par 
\par           19    charts showing the difference, and suggesting
\par 
\par           20    a routine or policy about -- in the two
\par 
\par           21    different cases.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    were -- or the error rates were minor, so
\par 
\par            2    they looked like they were relatively small,
\par 
\par            3    one tenth of a percent.  I personally tend
\par 
\par            4    not to like putting noise in data, but it
\par 
\par            5    looks like it's working here, one tenth of a
\par 
\par            6    percent -- or even one percent of errors,
\par 
\par            7    looks like we gave you a fairly reasonable
\par 
\par            8    table, and with small numbers like that.
\par 
\par            9              He gave us a couple of -- three
\par 
\par           10    questions, one dealing with protection of the
\par 
\par           11    data with either slight errors or protection
\par 
\par           12    of the data by removing cells, the discussion
\par 
\par           13    on the difference between the two.
\par 
\par           14              Second issue was on the question of
\par 
\par           15    common approach.  Our suggestion here was
\par 
\par           16    there -- there are approaches (?) out there,
\par 
\par           17    and Census was mentioned -- it's a problem
\par 
\par           18    that -- it is going to this problem all the
\par 
\par           19    time.  And I asked the question about what
\par 
\par           20    happens if sensitive information is released?
\par 
\par           21    If there's a fallback, saying this is
\par 
\par           22    what -- this is sort of the industry

\par            1    standard.  Census does X, we are also doing
\par 
\par            2    X, so there's a routine in place.  Maybe -- a
\par 
\par            3    response to the question about a common
\par 
\par            4    approach.
\par 
\par            5              And there's a question on -- just
\par 
\par            6    generally in the way of information.  I think
\par 
\par            7    there was less discussion on that question.
\par 
\par            8              There was a question from the
\par 
\par            9    audience of -- within our discussion about
\par 
\par           10    can data be released after a period of time.
\par 
\par           11    And the answer was it looks like the industry
\par 
\par           12    complained with that proposal.  Other than
\par 
\par           13    that there was data that's sensitive when
\par 
\par           14    it's released today, maybe if you wait a
\par 
\par           15    year -- eight months or so -- you wait eight
\par 
\par           16    months maybe for release of the data.
\par 
\par           17              This was proposed by the agency.
\par 
\par           18    And noted industry was unhappy with them,
\par 
\par           19    with that proposal.  And there's also some
\par 
\par           20    discussion about how to publish tables with
\par 
\par           21    the data withheld, and noted that that could

\par 
\par            1    suggested in that you published upper and

\par

\par

\par 
\par            1    comments made by the Committee, like
\par 
\par            2    specifically, Jae, and I think I was in that
\par 
\par            3    that session as well as a couple of years
\par 
\par            4    ago.  And the question was that -- and I
\par 
\par            5    think Tom is -- you know, as I did, he has
\par 
\par            6    been in the same position.
\par 
\par            7              People -- scientists, researchers
\par 
\par            8    are using data from two different sources on
\par 
\par            9    the same information, two different
\par 
\par           10    source -- the data coming from two different
\par 
\par           11    sources, and you get different answers.  Why?
\par 
\par           12    So this is the question that people ask many
\par 
\par           13    times.
\par 
\par           14              And EIA, being the data guru in
\par 
\par           15    many of these projects, is the place where
\par 
\par           16    people look for answers.  So it would be nice
\par 
\par           17    if the EIA can provide a place or provide the
\par 
\par           18    answers for some of these questions.  And I
\par 
\par           19    think that it was a good question, and I
\par 
\par           20    think the project had been started as a
\par 
\par           21    response to that, and I think it's a great
\par 
\par           22    project in lots of ways.  I think it's a very

\par 
\par 
\par            1    ambitious project.
\par 
\par            2              And I think -- so what the idea
\par 
\par            3    here is as presented by Jake and Renee and
\par 
\par            4    Shawna, Laurence, I think many people were
\par 
\par            5    there in the audience, so the team is
\par 
\par            6    building an information quality webpage.  One
\par 
\par            7    webpage called information quality so that
\par 
\par            8    people can come -- whoever has questions like
\par 
\par            9    that will come to that webpage, click on the
\par 
\par           10    whatever -- or basically, browse through
\par 
\par           11    whatever information is available; okay?  I
\par 
\par           12    think that is the current concept.
\par 
\par           13              So I think the essential question
\par 
\par           14    for the Committee was -- is it going to be
\par 
\par           15    red for stop or green for go?  And as
\par 
\par           16    expected, I think committee's answer was
\par 
\par           17    yellow.  I think that's -- you know, you can
\par 
\par           18    essentially say yellow.  I think you have to
\par 
\par           19    proceed with caution on this one, because
\par 
\par           20    this is a very tricky issue.  So let me go
\par 
\par           21    over some of the points that were brought up.
\par 
\par           22    Like I said, this is a very -- I think it's a

\par 
\par 
\par            1    very fascinating project, I think.
\par 
\par            2              A general question is that there's
\par 
\par            3    maybe in the public mind, there might -- even
\par 
\par            4    for one public, I think even intellectuals, I
\par 
\par            5    think there may be a question about, is data
\par 
\par            6    quality information -- quality are the same?
\par 
\par            7    Or is there a -- what kind of difference is
\par 
\par            8    there?  When does data become information?
\par 
\par            9    Is really data input, information output?  So
\par 
\par           10    I think that just by putting information
\par 
\par           11    quality, we may not be able to channel the
\par 
\par           12    browser to the right place.  I think that is
\par 
\par           13    one thing that came out in the discussion.
\par 
\par           14              So -- many points were brought up,
\par 
\par           15    I think one of the things I think everybody
\par 
\par           16    there felt that -- I think I should probably
\par 
\par           17    bring it to your attention in your handout, I
\par 
\par           18    think it's there, the two candidate web pages
\par 
\par           19    are there in your handout -- it will be
\par 
\par           20    useful for you to take a quick look at it,
\par 
\par           21    it's really worthwhile taking a look at it.
\par 
\par           22    I would like to draw your attention to that,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    it sort of looks like this.
\par 
\par            2              SPEAKER:  That's tab 6.
\par 
\par            3              MR. NEERCHAL:  Tab 6, yes.  Tab 6,
\par 
\par            4    so these are the two candidate web pages.
\par 
\par            5    And I think you pretty much believed this
\par 
\par            6    one, I think everybody liked the one with the
\par 
\par            7    less clutter.  I think for the discussion
\par 
\par            8    purposes, take a look at the one with the
\par 
\par            9    less clutter.  I would say it is uniformly
\par 
\par           10    better-liked -- even though there are some
\par 
\par           11    good aspects to the other one, not that it is
\par 
\par           12    worse than this, but it is better-liked.
\par 
\par           13              And so you can take a look and see
\par 
\par           14    the kind of information metrics they are
\par 
\par           15    trying to put up there.  One of them is, for
\par 
\par           16    example, timeliness.  And if you click on the
\par 
\par           17    timeliness, you'll go and see actually a
\par 
\par           18    graph starting from 2000 all the way to 2006
\par 
\par           19    for a number of service -- when the data was
\par 
\par           20    made available to public, that kind of
\par 
\par           21    timeline was put.  And how many days after
\par 
\par           22    the survey was completed was the data

\par 
\par 
\par            1    available to public.
\par 
\par            2              And it's an amazing graph.  I think
\par 
\par            3    its worthwhile taking a look at the graph in
\par 
\par            4    case you are not there.  It's an amazing
\par 
\par            5    graph.  I think that over a period of six or
\par 
\par            6    seven years, that kind of a record is just
\par 
\par            7    enviable.  So something like this; okay?
\par 
\par            8              And I think one of the things that
\par 
\par            9    was brought up, is there was one particular
\par 
\par           10    survey where things were not going as well as
\par 
\par           11    it could, because there's a lot of
\par 
\par           12    variability when the data was available to
\par 
\par           13    people, but it was -- whatever they show us,
\par 
\par           14    it was -- I am sure it was brought to the
\par 
\par           15    attention of the right people, and even one
\par 
\par           16    out of control survey was brought in control.
\par 
\par           17              I think it was a tremendous
\par 
\par           18    success.  And this is -- is bravo.  I think
\par 
\par           19    everybody there was saying that's a great
\par 
\par           20    track record.  This shows the track record of
\par 
\par           21    EIA, and also, a track record also builds
\par 
\par           22    confidence in their users, so this is the

\par 
\par 
\par            1    kind of information you definitely want to
\par 
\par            2    put it in front of people.  There's no doubt
\par 
\par            3    about i\ltrpar t.
\par 
\par            4              But of course, there are some
\par 
\par            5    downsides to it, because suppose something
\par 
\par            6    happens and you are not able to maintain that
\par 
\par            7    kind of a record next year, you are bound to
\par 
\par            8    get two or three nasty e-mails saying how
\par 
\par            9    come you are so late and all that, even
\par 
\par           10    though you have been very good for ten years,
\par 
\par           11    it doesn't count today.  I think there are a
\par 
\par           12    lot of information here that I think is
\par 
\par           13    really worthwhile bringing into the public.
\par 
\par           14              But I think the question, the
\par 
\par           15    caution coming from the fact that who are we
\par 
\par           16    trying to target this web page towards.  I
\par 
\par           17    mean, is it your public, because some of the
\par 
\par           18    information here like sampling errors and
\par 
\par           19    things like that may be useful for the
\par 
\par           20    public.  But some of the other information
\par 
\par           21    may be too in-depth for -- like comparison
\par 
\par           22    between MEX (?) and AER data, maybe too

\par 
\par 
\par            1    in-depth for a regular person.  It may be
\par 
\par            2    more useful for Tom.  Somebody like a
\par 
\par            3    researcher, for example.  It maybe more
\par 
\par            4    interesting for that person.
\par 
\par            5              And not only that, to really come
\par 
\par            6    up with that kind of a comparison, a regular
\par 
\par            7    basis comparison between MEX and AER,
\par 
\par            8    in-depth comparison that will be acceptable
\par 
\par            9    to a researcher, that will pass the muster
\par 
\par           10    with -- in front of a research group, may be
\par 
\par           11    a tremendous amount of work, and you may not
\par 
\par           12    want to expend that kind of energy year-in
\par 
\par           13    and year-out.
\par 
\par           14              So this is the general flavor of
\par 
\par           15    the discussion, I think.  And that it may be
\par 
\par           16    too demanding, maybe you are setting yourself
\par 
\par           17    too high a goal.  And what are the other
\par 
\par           18    cautionary -- I think that it may be easy to
\par 
\par           19    build, but very hard to maintain.  So I think
\par 
\par           20    the overall recommendation from the audience
\par 
\par           21    and the Committee members there was that take
\par 
\par           22    another look at what you're doing, and see

\par 
\par            3              And maybe start with this webpage.
\par 
\par            4    For example, start with this webpage, the
\par 
\par            5    items that are there, and divide them into
\par 
\par            6    two groups, because there are many items here
\par 
\par            7    that are probably very useful for the
\par 
\par            8    internal purposes, for tracking yourself,
\par 
\par            9    your performance, and you want to create your
\par 
\par           10    annual report, a nice graph like that for
\par 
\par           11    tracking purposes, say that hey, this is how
\par 
\par           12    good we are and things like that, you may not
\par 
\par           13    want to really publish it to public.  So you
\par 
\par           14    may want to do that first thing.
\par 
\par           15              And on the other hand, something
\par 
\par           16    like data comparisons -- do it in-depth for
\par

\par           19    something like a position paper, every once

\par            1    they will get a feel for what you have
\par 
\par            2    learned based on your work, and they can
\par 
\par            3    start from that point onwards instead of
\par 
\par            4    re-inventing it themselves.
\par 
\par            5              Now, that brings us to an issue
\par 
\par            6    about how do people come there, because you
\par 
\par            7    can put all this information in one place,
\par 
\par            8    because in a computer, it is in one place or
\par 
\par            9    you -- it really doesn't -- there's no GPS
\par 
\par           10    inside a computer.  So you can put it
\par 
\par           11    anywhere you want, the user will never know
\par 
\par           12    exactly where it is.  But in terms of
\par 
\par           13    navigation, where do you want to put it?
\par 
\par           14              How do people come to a page like
\par 
\par           15    that?  And there was a lot of discussion on
\par 
\par           16    that.  So something like information quality.
\par 
\par           17    Someone who is doing a Google search on
\par 
\par           18    quality will come there, so he will -- he has
\par 
\par           19    no questions in mind, he is just thinking
\par 
\par           20    quality.  Or someone may be very specific
\par 
\par           21    who's doing a dissertation piece, and he
\par 
\par           22    wants to learn more about data quality of a

\par 
\par 
\par            1    specific survey might end up there, so you
\par 
\par            2    will have a variety of people coming to that
\par 
\par            3    same place.
\par 
\par            4              And trying to satisfy such a wide
\par 
\par            5    audience with one page like that may be too
\par 
\par            6    ambitious -- I think that is the overall
\par 
\par            7    caution.  Because people might come there, so
\par 
\par            8    the question kind of led to the idea of is
\par 
\par            9    there some way you can control how people
\par 
\par           10    come there, or at least maybe sense their
\par 
\par           11    clicks in some sense; right.
\par 
\par           12              And of course there's information
\par 
\par           13    systems department around the country,
\par 
\par           14    including my own department, my own campus,
\par 
\par           15    is busy doing this kind of research.  The
\par 
\par           16    human/computer interactions of that is going
\par 
\par           17    on and IS people are -- they are doing
\par 
\par           18    statistic review.  And probably getting stuff
\par 
\par           19    on it.  And so I think -- so there are some
\par 
\par           20    recommendations that maybe it's a good idea
\par 
\par           21    to take a look at similar projects that's
\par 
\par           22    going on -- I think specifically State of the

\par 
\par 
\par            1    USA project, maybe there may be some useful
\par 
\par            2    tools available from there, maybe you should
\par 
\par            3    take a look at this recommendation what's
\par 
\par            4    going in.
\par 
\par            5              And finally, Jae, who did the
\par 
\par            6    presentation, and who is one of the leaders
\par 
\par            7    of this project, had an\ltrpar other totally
\par 
\par            8    antithesis to this concept, I think.  And I
\par 
\par            9    thought that I should bring it up officially
\par 
\par           10    so it's there in the record, so if you want
\par 
\par           11    to take a look at it again: here, the idea is
\par 
\par           12    to create one place where you put all the
\par 
\par           13    information quality products that has somehow
\par 
\par           14    centralized all the available information
\par 
\par           15    quality products -- available -- that means
\par 
\par           16    even if you don't want to put any money into
\par 
\par           17    it -- available products.
\par 
\par           18              But I think his recommendation,
\par 
\par           19    basically based on the audience's discussion,
\par 
\par           20    I think was to think, hey, what if I instead
\par 
\par           21    put the information quality button in
\par 
\par           22    wherever people are working.

\par 
\par 
\par            1              So people may be working in a
\par 
\par            2    particular area.  They may be in electric or
\par 
\par            3    they might be in gas, they may be in coal or
\par 
\par            4    whatever; that project place, wherever the
\par 
\par            5    people are coming for data, coming for
\par 
\par            6    project information, coming for information
\par 
\par            7    in general, put a little information quality
\par 
\par            8    button there and allow them to click, and
\par 
\par            9    then you can actually sense that where they
\par 
\par           10    are clicking from, because machines are
\par 
\par           11    capable of doing that.
\par 
\par           12              You can say, okay, this guy is
\par 
\par           13    looking for information quality, and he or
\par 
\par           14    she is actually in the coal page, for
\par 
\par           15    example, or MEX page, or AER page, but that
\par 
\par           16    can be sensed.  Then you can use that
\par 
\par           17    information to direct them to a much more
\par 
\par           18    specific part of this information quality
\par 
\par           19    group of pages, and this is an idea.
\par 
\par           20              And I think that's kind of -- it
\par 
\par           21    seems to me that there were actually many
\par 
\par           22    people who were talking about something very

\par 
\par 
\par            1    much like that, including John, who was
\par 
\par            2    saying that something most irritating for me
\par 
\par            3    is that I am -- I have done four or five
\par 
\par            4    clicks, I am doing research on a specific
\par 
\par            5    topic, and suddenly I have a quality-related
\par 
\par            6    question, I click on quality, they take me
\par 
\par            7    all the way back to the highest level of data
\par 
\par            8    quality at the White House level, right; we
\par 
\par            9    believe in quality or something like
\par 
\par           10    that -- In God We Trust, some high-level
\par 
\par           11    information like that.  I think that's very
\par 
\par           12    annoying to a researcher and a user.
\par 
\par           13              It seems to me that this is really
\par 
\par           14    your answer to that.  The idea is that if
\par 
\par           15    someone is clicking information quality from
\par 
\par           16    a page, that wherever they are, then try to
\par 
\par           17    really guess -- you don't even have to guess,
\par 
\par           18    you can just simply be very honest and say,
\par 
\par           19    listen, I know you came from coal, these are
\par 
\par           20    the only two things we have as far as quality
\par 
\par           21    is concerned.  That's all we have.  You know,
\par 
\par           22    I think that is a much better and they will

\par            1    enjoy that honesty, appreciate that honesty.
\par

\par 
\par            3    I don't know whether I left anything out.  I
\par 
\par            4    know there are a lot of good ideas being
\par 
\par            5    discussed.  I think it was a very lively
\par 
\par            6    session.  I learned a lot.  I wish Jae was
\par 
\par            7    there to see what came out of his suggestion,
\par 
\par            8    but he was not there.  But I think it was
\par 
\par            9    quite enjoyable, I think.  And it seems like
\par 
\par           10    a great deal of thought, and I think most
\par 
\par           11    importantly, I think that -- you really have
\par 
\par           12    to take pride in being able to say something
\par 
\par           13    like that -- a lot of people, they do not
\par 
\par           14    even have the data to say that.
\par 
\par           15              So that's my summary.

\par 
\par           21    for people to maintain these web pages and

\par

\par 
\par            3    our National Energy Information Center is
\par 
\par            4    responsible for the home page and for
\par 
\par            5    improvements of the home page, and they are
\par 
\par            6    doing a lot to try to improve the home page
\par 
\par            7    and our web access.  Jae is on the web
\par 
\par            8    steering committee, so there's a group of
\par 
\par            9    people from throughout the agency who provide
\par 
\par           10    advice on that, too.  But I think the

\par 
\par           12    think about.

\par 
\par           21    report.  That broken link report is

\par 
\par            1    there's a webpage content manager for every

\par 
\par            3    has the largest broken link report.  So we
\par 
\par            4    are looking at that -- the maintenance is
\par 
\par            5    going on a regular monthly basis, so -- and
\par 
\par            6    we've learned about them ad hoc, but we are

\par 
\par           10              I don't see any other questions.

\par 
\par           17    right.  But John, you're in charge for this
\par 
\par           18    one, because you're the discussant.
\par 
\par           19              MR. WEYANT:  Okay.  I'll do my best
\par 
\par           20    to understand.  I'm counting on the Committee
\par 
\par           21    to help me out.  You know more about the

\par 
\par            3    this afternoon.  My name's Kobi Platt.  I'm
\par 
\par            4    an industry economist here at EIA.  I work in
\par 
\par            5    the Office of Energy Markets and End Use.
\par 
\par            6    And in particular, I work primarily on the
\par 
\par            7    short-term energy outlook, managing the
\par 
\par            8    domestic natural gas portion of that
\par 
\par            9    publication, which is put out each month.
\par 
\par           10              Today, I'm here to give hopefully a
\par 
\par           11    short presentation about industrial natural
\par 
\par           12    gas demand: our understanding of it and lack
\par 
\par           13    thereof.  I want to encourage folks that this
\par 
\par           14    is intended to be very interruptible -- if
\par 
\par           15    you have questions for clarification,
\par 
\par           16    questions that may relate to things not on
\par 
\par           17    the presentation, just feel free to interrupt
\par 
\par           18    me.
\par 
\par           19              There's a small packet of handouts
\par 
\par           20    in color actually that went around, I think.
\par 
\par           21    There are more on the table outside if you

\par            1    slides here today, but they're the slides
\par 
\par            2    that probably provide the most detail, the
\par 
\par            3    most conversational topics, and are probably
\par 
\par            4    the more complicated slides.
\par 
\par            5              So I just wanted to provide those
\par 
\par            6    to you in case there's trouble transmitting
\par 
\par            7    up here or you wanted to take a closer look
\par 
\par            8    there at your seat.  So just to give you a
\par 
\par            9    brief introduction, these next few slides
\par 
\par           10    will sort of be introductory.
\par 
\par           11              There's several factors affecting
\par 
\par           12    industrial natural gas demand in our
\par 
\par           13    short-term forecast: GDP, employment, prices;
\par 
\par           14    weather, and this last bullet, which is the
\par 
\par           15    one we're going to focus on today, is this
\par 
\par           16    natural gas-weighted industrial production
\par 
\par           17    index.
\par 
\par           18              And the abbreviated example I have
\par 
\par           19    for you right here, which essentially -- it
\par 
\par           20    combines production indices for several key
\par 
\par           21    industrial subgroups that we've identified,
\par 
\par           22    and I'll get into that in a minute, along

\par 
\par 
\par            1    with the associated natural gas share in that
\par 
\par            2    industrial subgroup, based on total
\par 
\par            3    industrial natural gas consumption.
\par 
\par            4              So for example, these three
\par 
\par            5    industries were identified as primary
\par 
\par            6    gas-consuming industries: food, paper,
\par 
\par            7    fabricated metals.  There are six others in
\par 
\par            8    between there, and that number in parentheses
\par 
\par            9    is the share of natural gas consumed in that
\par 
\par           10    industry relative to the total; okay?
\par 
\par           11              The problem around this
\par 
\par           12    gas-weighted production index is that ever
\par 
\par           13    since about 2002, we've seen that industrial
\par 
\par           14    natural gas consumption has actually declined
\par 
\par           15    pretty regularly, or with a pretty consistent
\par 
\par           16    trend, and actually, this index -- the
\par 
\par           17    proxies for industrial consumption have
\par 
\par           18    actually been increasing.
\par 
\par           19              So there's a question as to whether
\par 
\par           20    or not -- or the extent to which these
\par 
\par           21    production measures are actually a good sort
\par 
\par           22    of indicator of natural gas demand.

\par 
\par            5    be -- there are several, but the industrial
\par 
\par            6    production indices come from this global
\par 
\par            7    insight production forecast that we get each
\par

\par           17    exactly --
\par 
\par           18              MR. PLATT:  So as you can see here,
\par 
\par           19    the industrial sector counts for a very
\par 
\par           20    large, or about a third of the natural gas
\par 
\par           21    consumption in the United States; this is
\par 
\par           22    2006; that 30 percent equates to about

\par 
\par            1    6.6 trillion cubic feet.  Just by comparison
\par 
\par            2    in 1997, that number was 8.5 trillion cubic
\par 
\par            3    feet, or 37 percent of the total domestic
\par 
\par            4    natural gas consumption.  So there's been a
\par 
\par            5    fairly precipitous decline in the industrial
\par 
\par            6    sector.
\par 
\par            7              This chart shows the breakout of
\par 
\par            8    industrial subgroups, which is taken from the
\par 
\par            9    2002 MECS -- Manufacturing Energy Consumption
\par 
\par           10    Survey, which is done every four years here
\par 
\par           11    at EIA.  You can see the largest sectors,
\par 
\par           12    petroleum and coal products, chemicals, which
\par 
\par           13    can be broken out into plastics and resins,
\par 
\par           14    fertilizers, petrochemicals, and then
\par 
\par           15    finally, primary metals.  I highlight those,
\par 
\par           16    because those will be  three of the sectors
\par 
\par           17    that we're actually going to talk about

\par 
\par            1    the shares for each of those industrial
\par 
\par            2    subgroups, has changed.  There's some
\par 
\par            3    shoehorning that went on here due to the
\par 
\par            4    change in classification system.  We went
\par 
\par            5    from the SIC to NAICS in 1998, so the 1994
\par 
\par            6    column is probably guesswork at best.  But as
\par 
\par            7    you can --
\par 
\par            8              MR. RUTHERFORD:  Does this include,
\par 
\par            9    like -- energetic uses or is this also
\par 
\par           10    feedstocks?
\par 
\par           11              MR. PLATT:  It does not include
\par 
\par           12    feedstocks, with the exception of
\par 
\par           13    agricultural chemicals, because the dry gas
\par 
\par           14    is really only a feedstock in ammonia
\par 
\par           15    production -- for agricultural chemicals; the
\par 
\par           16    other feedstocks aren't the gas that we're
\par 
\par           17    trying to forecast.
\par 
\par           18              MR. RUTHERFORD:  Okay.
\par 
\par           19              MR. PLATT:  As you can see the
\par 
\par           20    trend, regardless of the share that we used
\par 
\par           21    for generating the industrial production, the
\par 
\par           22    gas-weighted production index is relatively

\par 
\par 
\par            1    the same.  So taking the '94 MECS, the '98

\par            4              One of the questions I've gotten
\par 
\par            5    when I give this presentation, where I've
\par 
\par            6    given it in the past is how does the
\par 
\par            7    production index change based on the shares?
\par 
\par            8    Well, this historical figure seems to suggest
\par 
\par            9    that it doesn't change a whole lot.  This is
\par 
\par           10    a graphical representation of the puzzle that
\par 
\par           11    I've described right at the beginning.

\par 
\par           15    Industrial Gas-Weighted Production Index,
\par 
\par           16    which as you can see, beginning again in
\par 
\par           17    about 2002, the trend seems to diverge pretty
\par 
\par           18    dramatically.  Yeah?
\par 
\par           19              MR. RUTHERFORD:  What's happening
\par

\par

\par            1    drivers for what's going on here.  We'll get
\par 
\par            2    to some of the details in a few minutes here,
\par 
\par            3    but that's obviously a major driver here.
\par 
\par            4              The question is, regardless of
\par 
\par            5    whether or not we're looking at efficiency
\par 
\par            6    gains, conservation, offshoring, how do we
\par 
\par            7    model those first of all, and are those
\par 
\par            8    trends permanent or are they temporary?
\par 
\par            9              You know, have the lower-hanging
\par 
\par           10    fruit been captured, so to speak, or are we
\par 
\par           11    going to continue to see the same persistence
\par 
\par           12    in efficiency gains that we have over that
\par 
\par           13    period?  Those are sort of the questions we
\par 
\par           14    have in developing this.
\par 
\par           15              MS. KHANNA:  Just for a second, can
\par 
\par           16    you define what you mean by efficiency gain
\par 
\par           17    in this context?
\par 
\par           18              MR. PLATT:  I would say, just
\par 
\par           19    generally speaking, increased output with
\par 
\par           20    decreased consumption -- energy consumption,
\par 
\par           21    input.
\par

\par 
\par            1              MR. PLATT:  So here's -- it's gas
\par 
\par            2    for the purposes of this discussion.
\par 
\par            3              So there are several steps that we
\par 
\par            4    took to try to let's say enhance the
\par 
\par            5    industrial -- the gas-weighted production
\par 
\par            6    index.  You can see here that the QSIC
\par 
\par            7    coefficient, the original QSIC coefficient
\par 
\par            8    had six industrial subgroups; okay?  We
\par 
\par            9    expanded upon that, or we altered that
\par 
\par           10    slightly and developed the QSIC2 coefficient
\par 
\par           11    sublist.
\par 
\par           12              And all we did basically was we
\par 
\par           13    reallocated chemical -- allocation -- the gas
\par 
\par           14    demand for chemicals into this category,
\par 
\par           15    basic chemicals minus pharmaceuticals.
\par 
\par           16    Essentially what we were trying to do was
\par 
\par           17    adjust for large increases in production in
\par 
\par           18    non-gas-intensive industries; pharmaceuticals
\par 
\par           19    being one, computer technologies being
\par 
\par           20    another.  Just a couple of examples that we
\par 
\par           21    tried to account for by moving that share
\par 
\par           22    into the next category.

\par 
\par 
\par            1              The new QSIC coefficients actually
\par 
\par            2    expanded the total number of industry
\par 
\par            3    subgroups that we looked at from six to nine,
\par 
\par            4    and did help to enhance or improve upon the
\par 
\par            5    gas-weighted production index that we were
\par 
\par            6    able to generate.  The problem was, it did a
\par 
\par            7    great job prior to 2002.  This period here.
\par 
\par            8    It helped to bump up the production index
\par 
\par            9    prior to 2002, but you can see there's
\par 
\par           10    virtually no change in that post-2002 period.
\par 
\par           11    So we added those subgroups, but it really
\par 
\par           12    didn't do anything to help us explain sort of
\par 
\par           13    what was going on here.
\par 
\par           14              So we really had to dig a little
\par 
\par           15    deeper into what was going on in each one of
\par 
\par           16    these, or in a few of these key industrial
\par 
\par           17    consuming subgroups.  The three that I've
\par 
\par           18    looked at for this presentation here are the
\par 
\par           19    petroleum and coal product sector,
\par 
\par           20    agricultural chemicals and primary metals.
\par 
\par           21              Those three accounted for roughly
\par 
\par           22    32 percent of natural gas consumption based

\par            1    on the 2002 MECS, and we'll jump into that
\par 
\par            2    analysis here.
\par 
\par            3              The first sector, as I mentioned,
\par 
\par            4    is petroleum and coal products; accounted for
\par 
\par            5    roughly 14 percent of total industrial
\par 
\par            6    consumption.  In 2002, the vast majority of
\par 
\par            7    the consumption in this subgroup was in
\par 
\par            8    petroleum refineries, so that's where the
\par 
\par            9    focus is here.
\par 
\par           10              Natural gas consumption, according
\par 
\par           11    to EIA statistics, declined more than
\par 
\par           12    17 percent at petroleum refineries from 2000
\par 
\par           13    to 2006.  This graph, I know I included in
\par 
\par           14    that handout, because it's fairly involved,
\par 
\par           15    and I'll just walk through it one by one.
\par 
\par           16              So these are petroleum refineries.
\par 
\par           17    This is a petroleum refinery database at EIA.
\par 
\par           18    So the blue line is total fuel consumption at
\par 
\par           19    refineries, and you can see that it's fairly
\par 
\par           20    consistent, fairly flat since about 2000.
\par 
\par           21    Even before that.  Increasing from the
\par 
\par           22    beginning of the series and sort of leveling

\par 
\par 
\par            1    off at the early part of the decade here.
\par 
\par            2              The orange line, which peaks in
\par 
\par            3    1998, is natural gas consumption at these
\par 
\par            4    refineries.  You see a dramatic increase in
\par 
\par            5    gas consumption up to 1998, and then a
\par 
\par            6    dramatic decline right after that point.
\par 
\par            7    Here's where I think it gets interesting, and
\par 
\par            8    this is another question that I've gotten
\par 
\par            9    when I've given this presentation -- well,
\par 
\par           10    what about production at these refineries;
\par 
\par           11    did these refineries close?  What was going
\par 
\par           12    on?  And you can see the green line there's
\par 
\par           13    crude runs at those refineries again sort of
\par 
\par           14    holding steady with that blue line, the total
\par 
\par           15    fuel consumption, in the near-term.
\par 
\par           16              The most perplexing thing is this
\par 
\par           17    red line, which is global insights production
\par 
\par           18    index at refineries, which, beginning in
\par 
\par           19    2003, increases dramatically.  It seems to go
\par 
\par           20    against everything that the other data here
\par 
\par           21    suggests.  And this number feeds right into
\par 
\par           22    our industrial production index.  So it's a

\par 
\par 
\par            1    major question about how accurately this is
\par 
\par            2    capturing what's going on in the sector.
\par 
\par            3              So I dug a little deeper.  You can
\par 
\par            4    actually see that over 86 percent of the
\par 
\par            5    decline in natural gas consumption at the
\par 
\par            6    U.S. refineries occurred at only 16
\par 
\par            7    refineries here in the United States.  So a
\par 
\par            8    vast majority of the decline in gas
\par 
\par            9    consumption happened at just a small number
\par 
\par           10    of the total refineries.  So again the
\par 
\par           11    question, did these refineries close?
\par 
\par           12              Well, no, the green line again,
\par 
\par           13    crude run, seems to suggest that these
\par 
\par           14    refineries have been operating business as
\par 
\par           15    usual.
\par 
\par           16              But the red line, total fuel
\par 
\par           17    consumption, and the blue line, natural gas
\par 
\par           18    consumption, show this very clear declining
\par 
\par           19    trend since about 1998.  The refinery story
\par 
\par           20    seems to be one of efficiency, increases,
\par 
\par           21    conservation.  Perhaps the surveys aren't
\par 
\par           22    doing a good job of capturing what fuels they

\par 
\par            1    might be using at these refineries.  There
\par 
\par            2    are any number of explanations that may or
\par 
\par            3    may not -- yeah, go ahead.
\par 
\par            4              MR. WEYANT:  One other one is, is
\par 
\par            5    there any change in the product mix?  Like is
\par 
\par            6    there more gasoline being produced, say, at
\par 
\par            7    these refineries at the end of 2006 than the
\par 
\par            8    2002?  The reason I ask is that -- the way
\par 
\par            9    refineries get extra hydrogen to do
\par 
\par           10    hydrocracking is from gas; right?
\par 
\par           11              MR. PLATT:  Uh-huh.
\par 
\par           12              MR. WEYANT:  So this is the
\par 
\par           13    hydrogen economy (?)  Element, you had to
\par 
\par           14    make hydrogen break down into natural gas,
\par 
\par           15    the oil companies do it all the time, the
\par 
\par           16    reason they do it is for hydrocracking.  So I
\par 
\par           17    don't know how the accounting works here.  Is
\par 
\par           18    that kind of a part of a refinery that would
\par 
\par           19    do that, that would make the extra hydrogen
\par 
\par           20    used to increase the yield of gasoline?
\par 
\par           21              MR. PLATT:  I don't know.  That's a

\par

\par 
\par            7    the agricultural chemical sector, because it
\par

\par            9    little deeper.

\par           13    This is primarily nitrogen fertilizers, and
\par 
\par           14    that's primarily ammonia production, and

\par           15    that's where the feedstock -- the fuel and

\par           18              Historically, ammonia production
\par

\par 
\par          \ltrpar   5              You can see pre-2002, those trends
\par 
\par            6    were all fairly consistent with one another;
\par 
\par            7    however, again in 2002, these trends
\par 
\par            8    diverged.  From 2002 to '05, ammonia
\par 
\par            9    production has declined 13-1/2 percent, and
\par 
\par           10    yet the global insight production for agr
\par 
\par           11    chem has increased over 15 percent in that
\par 
\par           12    same period.  So this is sort of the
\par 
\par           13    offshoring of technology story.
\par 
\par           14              U.S. Census Bureau data indicates
\par 
\par           15    that ammonia imports have increased over
\par 
\par           16    40 percent from 2001 to 2005.
\par 
\par           17    Furthermore -- and this is just through the
\par 
\par           18    first half of '06; the most recent data that
\par 
\par           19    I was able to get -- the percentage of
\par 
\par           20    imports to total consumption in the U.S. was
\par 
\par           21    up over 44 percent, relative to about

\par            1              So this seems to be a trend that at

\par

\par 
\par            6    it presents us with the same sorts of
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par           15    percent of total industrial natural gas
\par 
\par           16    consumption in 2002, the majority of which
\par 
\par           17    was allocated to iron and steel mills, where
\par 
\par           18    natural gas consumption has declined more
\par 
\par           19    than eight percent from 1998 to 2005.
\par 
\par           20              This is according to the American

\par 
\par            8    consumption declined almost 9 percent.

\par 
\par 
\par            1    survey-related.  I've only read and heard
\par 
\par            2    sort of anecdotally that production in iron
\par 
\par            3    and steel mills has shifted from these major
\par 
\par            4    producers, which are clients of the American
\par 
\par            5    Iron and Steel Institute, to much smaller
\par 
\par            6    producing facilities, which are known as
\par 
\par            7    "mini mills" in the industry.  How do we
\par 
\par            8    capture those?  How are those driving gas use
\par 
\par            9    and captured in global insights production
\par 
\par           10    index, which may or may not be picked up by
\par

\par 
\par           13              So we put all that together and
\par 
\par           14    bring you back to the slide that I showed
\par 
\par           15    before we got into the nitty-gritty here.

\par 
\par           17    the QSIC-new with the nine broken-out
\par 
\par           18    subgroups.  And then I've added a fourth
\par 
\par           19    industrial natural gas/gas-weighted
\par 
\par           20    industrial production index, QSIC-kobi, which
\par 
\par           21    is that solid red line.  And you can see it
\par

\par 
\par 
\par            1              What I've done is I've forced the
\par 
\par            2    production indices -- for those three
\par 
\par            3    industries that I just talked about, I forced
\par 
\par            4    those to reflect sort of actual historical
\par 
\par            5    data in the production index, and I get this
\par 
\par            6    result here, which is better, not great, but
\par 
\par            7    does a better job of explaining industrial
\par 
\par            8    natural gas demand than at least we had
\par 
\par            9    previously.
\par 
\par           10              Just to show you sort of
\par 
\par           11    graphically what I did in forcing these
\par 
\par           12    down -- this is petroleum and coal products,
\par 
\par           13    which was pushed down prior to -- yeah,
\par 
\par           14    post-2002, that's the adjusted number in the
\par 
\par           15    blue.  Here's agricultural chemicals.  Again
\par 
\par           16    the same situation here, and primary metals.
\par 
\par           17              So there are, like I said, a lot
\par 
\par           18    more questions, I guess, than answers in this
\par 
\par           19    presentation, which I suppose is how these
\par 
\par           20    are supposed to go, but what other proxies or
\par 
\par           21    metrics are there for production, actually
\par 
\par           22    for natural gas consumption, if production

\par 
\par 
\par            1    isn't one of them?  One issue that I haven't
\par 
\par            2    addressed at all here is the changing shares
\par 
\par            3    in natural gas consumption for the different
\par 
\par            4    industry subgroups.
\par 
\par            5              The MECS is only updated every four
\par 
\par            6    years.  We got the last data -- we have the
\par 
\par            7    last data, which dates back to 2002.  How
\par 
\par            8    much have these industry shares changed in
\par 
\par            9    that time?  There have been, as you\ltrpar  said,
\par 
\par           10    huge increases in the price of natural gas
\par 
\par           11    here domestically.  So has there been -- as
\par 
\par           12    offshoring increased, what sort of changes
\par 
\par           13    have there been, and how do we implement that
\par 
\par           14    into the model here?
\par 
\par           15              Have we properly identified the
\par 
\par           16    right industry subgroups?  Should there be
\par 
\par           17    more added to our production index.  And what
\par 
\par           18    sort of revisions?  This is the last
\par 
\par           19    question.  What sort of revisions to the
\par 
\par           20    index could improve our forecasting in the

\par

\par 
\par            5    questions.  This is just monthly industrial
\par 
\par            6    gas consumption since January 2001.  This is
\par 
\par            7    from the Natural Gas Navigator Online.  This
\par 
\par            8    is the Henry Hub spot price, and you can see
\par 
\par            9    sort of the increase really starting here in
\par 
\par           10    2002, when this problem really sort of takes
\par 
\par           11    hold.

\par 
\par           15    maybe the first one is a great place to

\par 
\par           17    at things like value added, and they give us
\par 
\par           18    the same sort of result in terms of that

\par            2    forecasting model, so my normal way of
\par 
\par            3    thinking about this, and I think Tom -- as
\par 
\par            4    suggested by Tom, you have kind of price and
\par 
\par            5    quantity are the main drivers.  It seems like
\par 
\par            6    you're looking for a quantity driver that
\par 
\par            7    kind of dominates (inaudible).  So I wonder
\par 
\par            8    if it would be worth doing a little bit of
\par 
\par            9    work on price elasticity -- just to see if
\par 
\par           10    you get -- I don't know, some kind of lagged
\par 
\par           11    price response that explains this.
\par 
\par           12              This is a tough period.  I was just
\par 
\par           13    fooling around with utility natural gas
\par 
\par           14    prices from -- just by coincidence, from 2002
\par 
\par           15    to 2006, and they doubled, and then they
\par 
\par           16    doubled again, then they went down to three
\par 
\par           17    times, it's probably now two-and-a-half times
\par 
\par           18    the starting point.
\par 
\par           19              I don't know if other people have
\par 
\par           20    comments.  There are a number of trends.  You
\par 
\par           21    hear a lot from the refiners that you can't
\par 
\par           22    build any new plants because they're citing

\par            1    the environmental regs are affecting their

\par 
\par            3    tried to expand the refineries a lot -- I'm
\par 
\par            4    not sure how all that adds up to anything,
\par 
\par            5    but environmental regulations is a potential
\par 
\par            6    driver, I think.
\par 
\par            7              So you're more efficient not
\par 
\par            8    because -- production, costing and whatever
\par 
\par            9    your economic rule of thumb is (inaudible) or
\par 
\par           10    something.  You do it just to meet the
\par 
\par           11    environmental regulations in an industry like
\par 
\par           12    refineries.  I do think -- I once tried to do
\par

\par 
\par           14    Stephen Peck (?) and I who sort of tried to
\par 
\par           15    do this model.
\par 
\par           16              We had these like four-digit SIC
\par 
\par           17    code data, and we said, oh, this is going to
\par 
\par           18    really test it, and it turned out we picked
\par 
\par           19    exactly the wrong industry, because the big
\par 
\par           20    trend over our time period, 15 years, was
\par 
\par           21    electric mini-mills.  It is important to note

\par 
\par           16              What they do is a lot of recycling.

\par 
\par            8    I do have a feeling that one of the reactions

\par 
\par           15              One is statistics\ltrpar  and indices, and

\par 
\par            1    story that seems to be emerging in the
\par 
\par            2    economy, which isn't surprising, because one
\par 
\par            3    reason people like me get nervous when you
\par 
\par            4    think about doing industrial energy demand

\par

\par 
\par           16    than the environmental regs, although we

\par 
\par            3              So I suppose you could attach some
\par 
\par            4    kind of price analysis to the behavior that
\par

\par 
\par            8    going to be that (inaudible) you know the
\par 
\par            9    price is going up high, probably the question
\par 
\par           10    is would demand elasticity be plausible?  My
\par 
\par           11    guess is probably yes.
\par 
\par           12              But I think it'd be more
\par 
\par           13    interesting to look at what happens to demand
\par 
\par           14    for other fuels; is this gas being
\par 
\par           15    substituted by electricity, which -- I think
\par 
\par           16    the MECS has electricity demand as well --
\par 
\par           17              MR. PLATT:  I've looked, and that's
\par 
\par           18    one of the confusing parts, is that I've
\par 
\par           19    looked at both electricity and purchased

\par           18    steam and electricity, and they both are
\par 
\par           19    increasing, but on a BTU basis, don't seem to
\par 
\par           20    be making up the total difference in the

\par            4    next step, but that's sort of flipping
\par 
\par            5    through press releases and that kind of

\par

\par 
\par           12    sectors, at least the couple of slides that I
\par 
\par           13    have here in front of me, it looks like
\par 
\par           14    the -- even sectorwise, the trends are very
\par 
\par           15    similar, all consumption seems to peak at
\par 
\par           16    around '98 --

\par           19    there's a blip somewhere between 2000-2002
\par 
\par           20    and then there's another little decline, so
\par 
\par           21    that shows there's something that's not

\par

\par 
\par            8              MR. WEYANT:  Another implication is
\par 
\par            9    the aggregation among sectors is not that
\par

\par 
\par           18    this, but I think you implied it -- you're
\par

\par 
\par           20    industry that we get at the aggregate level,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    possible that they just did a big retrofit
\par 
\par            2    right -- that after 2002, they saw the gas
\par 
\par            3    prices going up, they said we've been meaning
\par 
\par            4    to do a massive retrofit for energy
\par 
\par            5    efficiency things.  Prices look like they
\par 
\par            6    might go up, down or stay down.  Now, they
\par 
\par            7    seem to be headed up, now is the time to do
\par 
\par            8    it.
\par 
\par            9              My memory of this period is it was
\par 
\par           10    a period where it was recognized that gas
\par 
\par           11    markets were going to be tight for a while.
\par 
\par           12              MR. PLATT:  Uh-huh.
\par 
\par           13              MR. RUTHERFORD:  A whole lot of
\par 
\par           14    electricity capacity was built on gas
\par 
\par           15    turbines, and it's pretty clear the writing
\par 
\par           16    was on the wall, so --
\par

\par 
\par           18    And that should be viewed over at the
\par 
\par           19    historical time frame where there was the gas
\par 
\par           20    bubble that became the gas sausage -- it went
\par

\par 
\par            3              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think you said

\par 
\par            6              MR. NEERCHAL:  Maybe out of 16,
\par 
\par            7    maybe two or three people -- two or three are
\par 
\par            8    friendly enough that you can have a frank
\par 
\par            9    conversation about this, and I think that
\par 
\par           10    that might be very, very informative.
\par 
\par           11              MR. PLATT:  Like Jim said, just
\par 
\par           12    call them up.
\par 
\par           13              MR. NEERCHAL:  Yes.
\par

\par 
\par           15    persist?  More refineries, are they adding
\par 
\par           16    these cogen units?  I don't know.  I mean, is
\par 
\par           17    that same writing on the wall now?  I --
\par 
\par           18              MR. RUTHERFORD:  The refineries are
\par 
\par           19    kind of problematic as they have this other
\par 
\par           20    energy source, and so it's possible they're
\par 
\par           21    doing something behind this.  But these other

\par 
\par            5    heat and power out of it.
\par

\par 
\par           11    analysis forecasting.  I'm going to build on
\par 
\par       \ltrpar     12    something Tom said.  I think dealing with
\par 
\par           13    refineries is going to be particularly
\par 
\par           14    difficult, as you're going to have to almost
\par 
\par           15    count all the carbon and hydrogen atoms
\par 
\par           16    moving into the refinery and moving out, the
\par 
\par           17    refinery is capable of using that in any
\par 
\par           18    combination it wants basically.  So for
\par 
\par           19    example, if it used to produce hydrogen
\par 
\par           20    onsite by consuming natural gas, and now
\par 
\par           21    that's moved outside the fence and you're
\par 
\par           22    using natural gas and only hydrogen's coming

\par 
\par            2              So I wouldn't first go to
\par 
\par            3    refineries; I would first go to the other
\par 
\par            4    sector, since they all do seem to be moving
\par 
\par            5    in the same direction.
\par 
\par            6              MR. WEYANT:  Ammonia and steel.
\par 
\par            7    Steel is not that hard.
\par 
\par            8              MR. CONTI:  And I would be looking
\par 
\par            9    at all energy at the same time, not just
\par 
\par           10    focusing in on natural gas.
\par 
\par           11              MR. PLATT:  Because you think that
\par 
\par           12    gas will follow the same trend, that total
\par 
\par           13    energy consumption in those sectors --
\par 
\par           14              MR. CONTI:  Not necessarily.  I
\par 
\par           15    think that you have to deal with it as a
\par 
\par           16    whole picture.  I think in some sectors,
\par 
\par           17    there's ability to switch, and there are
\par 
\par           18    across-price effects as well.  So I think
\par 
\par           19    you're going to need to deal with the whole
\par 
\par           20    energy question or to understand the natural
\par

\par

\par 
\par            6    to be coming from something; it's not like
\par 
\par            7    you can just click your hands and suddenly

\par 
\par           11    Something has to be substituted for it, so I
\par 
\par           12    think that's an interesting -- there's
\par 
\par           13    something mysterious here.  I think --
\par

\par 
\par           15              MR. WEYANT:  One theory is it's

\par 
\par           17    changes in behavior that change the

\par            1    production of gas.  So in the early days,
\par 
\par            2    people -- take a country like Japan that did
\par 
\par            3    make big strides in energy intensity
\par 
\par            4    improvements, and then people figured out
\par

\par 
\par            6    and aluminum that were firmly made in Japan
\par 
\par            7    were being made in Australia and then shipped
\par 
\par            8    back in, so it may be something like that.
\par 
\par            9              Actually, in refineries, the
\par 
\par           10    Caribbean would be a suspicious point, and
\par 
\par           11    perhaps even in ammonia.  But I don't know,
\par 
\par           12    in steel it could be the mini-mill thing.

\par 
\par            4              MR. PLATT:  I don't have access to

\par            5    the survey level data.  And in fact, one of
\par 
\par            6    the earlier slides I showed of the different
\par 
\par            7    MECS years, we only have fuel or feedstock
\par 
\par            8    data for -- and not even aggregate data in
\par 
\par            9    the different industry subgroups.
\par 
\par           10              MR. WEYANT:  I think finding some
\par 
\par           11    friendly people -- and there probably are
\par 
\par           12    some -- would be good.  So you may have to
\par 
\par           13    search a little bit to find them.
\par 
\par           14              I had a student once who was doing
\par 
\par           15    plasma art processing -- for ammonia, but
\par 
\par           16    it's 10 times too -- the gas prices back then
\par 
\par           17    were 10 times too high, but it looked like it
\par 
\par           18    was really kind of in the money already for
\par 
\par           19    making silicon wafers.  And we heard a rumor
\par 
\par           20    that Union Carbide had a plant up in the
\par 
\par           21    Northwest, so we called up Union Carbide.

\par            1    but three years later, we found out that's

\par 
\par            3    want anybody else to know that the economics
\par

\par

\par 
\par            5    second source in-house, we learned in the
\par 
\par            6    quality session -- learned about this nexus

\par           13    breakout there.  There's no subgroup, at
\par 
\par           14    least that I'm aware of.  So yeah, we can
\par

\par 
\par           16    on in these particular industries that is
\par

\par 
\par           19    at least even the history, and it just

\par            5    that we haven't talked about, so thank you
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par           16    2002 to 2004 period was a period where the
\par 
\par           17    electric generators were just building these
\par 
\par           18    turbines and smaller plants like mad, and the
\par 
\par           19    efficiency of those was a lot better than the
\par 
\par           20    existing, and I wonder if some of those were
\par 
\par           21    into the input -- built in the industrial
\par

\par           12    present this?  Do you say that we're using
\par 
\par           13    our old tried and proved method of short-term
\par 
\par           14    projections, but it seems like it's biased on
\par 
\par           15    the high side the last few years?
\par 
\par           16              MR. PLATT:  To be perfectly honest,
\par 
\par           17    the forecasting tools that we have on the
\par 
\par           18    industrial sector are blunt at best.  So to
\par 
\par           19    say that we rely on them independent of
\par 
\par           20    anecdotal factors would probably be a major
\par 
\par           21    stretch.  I think what we're doing is looking
\par 
\par           22    at a lot of those anecdotal sources to try to

\par 
\par            7              MR. RUTHERFORD:  It's interesting
\par 
\par            8    this thought about worrying about the
\par 
\par            9    denominator rather than the numerator.  I
\par 
\par           10    like this subject.

\par 
\par           13    basically -- DRA (inaudible) -- it's really
\par 
\par           14    an interesting idea because you have several
\par 
\par           15    options -- not getting other numerators to
\par 
\par           16    check, or denominators to check.  Like if you

\par

\par 
\par           11              MR. CONTI:  If you look at the blue
\par 
\par           12    chip economic indicators, they tend to be
\par 
\par           13    more or less as good as anybody else.  There
\par 
\par           14    are certain periods of time when they are
\par 
\par           15    more out of sync, and there are certain
\par 
\par           16    periods of time when they are better
\par 
\par           17    calibrated than anybody else.  So I think on
\par 
\par           18    average, you really can't say one way or
\par 
\par           19    another they're better or worse than the
\par 
\par           20    leading -- I think it is 200 indicators in

\par 
\par            4    and I was talking about here is have we gone
\par 
\par            5    back and tried to measure actual physical
\par 
\par            6    quantities?  And I think for some things that
\par 
\par            7    you can verify relatively easily, and others,
\par 
\par            8    it's much harder to do.  And we haven't been
\par

\par 
\par           14              MR. PLATT:  The global insight
\par 
\par           15    production indicies are based on the Federal
\par 
\par           16    Reserve Board's production database.  So it's
\par 
\par           17    just a two-year forecast based on those.
\par 
\par           18    And I think those are derived differently for
\par 
\par           19    every industry subgroup.
\par 
\par           20              MR. GANDERSON:  This is something

\par 
\par            9    to the question you were raising about gases
\par 
\par           10    gone down in terms of any new services,
\par 
\par           11    something else should have gone up.  And if
\par 
\par           12    you look at the graph you have on (inaudible)
\par 
\par           13    refineries, it shows clearly that (inaudible)
\par

\par

\par 
\par            4    think we should stay away from petroleum
\par 
\par            5    refineries, it's much more complex.  They
\par 
\par            6    could also import intermediate products that
\par 
\par            7    require less fuel to use in order to produce
\par 
\par            8    end use products.  So you could import
\par 
\par            9    something that's almost gasoline and it
\par 
\par           10    doesn't really show up.  And then all of a
\par 
\par           11    sudden you turn around, you call it
\par 
\par           12    "gasoline," and there's no fuel used to
\par 
\par           13    produce that.
\par 
\par           14              MR. WEYANT:  But it could be
\par 
\par           15    gasoline, not call it gasoline.
\par 
\par           16              MR. RUTHERFORD:  Could be --
\par 
\par           17              MR. CONTI:  So refineries are
\par 
\par           18    particularly difficult, and luckily we have a
\par 
\par           19    lot of data on them, at least internally, but
\par

\par 
\par            6              MR. WEYANT:  In this breakout
\par 
\par            7    group, we heard a great presentation by Kobi
\par 
\par            8    Platt on industrial natural gas demands, and
\par 
\par            9    we all learned a lot about how complicated
\par 
\par           10    this is.  Kind of felt like we were doing a
\par 
\par           11    course in econometrics during the course of
\par 
\par           12    the presentation.  So it's an interesting
\par 
\par           13    field for research.
\par 
\par           14              So let's see -- to summarize, I
\par 
\par           15    guess the issue is, for short-term
\par 
\par           16    forecasting, historically it has been
\par 
\par           17    possible and desirable to correlate the
\par 
\par           18    short-term trends in industrial gas demands
\par 
\par           19    to some kind of an output to measure.  And
\par 
\par           20    now there is some concern that at least
\par 
\par           21    the historically useful -- and I guess it

\par            1    them.
\par 
\par            2              It's kind of departing, so the
\par 
\par            3    production indices are going up, wherever you
\par 
\par            4    get firmed and however you weight them for a
\par 
\par            5    first approximation, and demand for natural
\par 
\par            6    gas is going down fairly dramatically.  So
\par 
\par            7    this led to a number of questions.
\par 
\par            8              I guess Tom and Neha went into what
\par 
\par            9    about prices?  And I guess that's kind of
\par 
\par          \ltrpar  10    been looked at a little bit that could be
\par 
\par           11    looked at more.  There are issues that have
\par 
\par           12    been addressed, but some that haven't been
\par 
\par           13    addressed on composition; several members, in
\par 
\par           14    the context of price effects, asking of a
\par 
\par           15    cross-price equivalent.
\par 
\par           16              Right at the end, Neha pointed out
\par 
\par           17    that in refineries at least, there did seem
\par 
\par           18    to be some substitution going on, just total
\par 
\par           19    energy (inaudible) much flatter even as
\par 
\par           20    industrial gas demands (inaudible).
\par 
\par           21              There's the kind of aggregation
\par 
\par           22    among sectors, among sub-industries and

\par 
\par 
\par            1    industrial sector issue, and there was some
\par 
\par            2    discussion of that, but again, Neha pointed
\par 
\par            3    out that this pattern seems to be pretty
\par 
\par            4    consistent even within the individual
\par 
\par            5    industry, so even before you get to the
\par 
\par            6    aggregation amongst industries, there's kind
\par 
\par            7    of within industry -- the fact that I think
\par 
\par            8    from what I got from your -- more details are
\par 
\par            9    in some of the -- go into 3-digit SIC code;
\par 
\par           10    so that's a little bit -- and in certain
\par 
\par           11    instances.  So there's this kind of price and
\par 
\par           12    price substitution effect, and then there's a
\par 
\par           13    whole bunch of speculation.
\par 
\par           14              I guess at that point, I was
\par 
\par           15    thinking that this session wound up a little
\par 
\par           16    bit like the morning session on
\par 
\par           17    fractionization for natural gas and natural
\par 
\par           18    gas liquids, in the sense that a lot of
\par 
\par           19    interesting hypotheses have come up and kind
\par 
\par           20    of starting to frame some specific questions.
\par 
\par           21              And then there's two ways you could
\par 
\par           22    go -- you could kind of mess around with

\par 
\par 
\par            1    statistics and aggregate different
\par 
\par            2    aggregators and do something on more of a
\par 
\par            3    macro level.  Or maybe dis-aggregate things
\par 
\par            4    that are currently more highly aggregated
\par 
\par            5    than might be appropriate.
\par 
\par            6              And then there's kind of the
\par 
\par            7    bottom-up, investigative reporting kind of
\par 
\par            8    thing where you can talk about what's going
\par 
\par            9    on.  And that, I think, did help resolve some
\par 
\par           10    of the theories about what might be the
\par 
\par           11    explanation for the trends and the leading
\par 
\par           12    hypothesis for why this is occurring.
\par 
\par           13              I guess again Neha pointed out that
\par 
\par           14    this does seem to be pretty pervasive.  So it
\par 
\par           15    seems systemic as opposed to any
\par 
\par           16    specific -- we were talking about this -- it
\par 
\par           17    is something that's kind of in effect where
\par 
\par           18    total energy and gas go down in every single
\par 
\par           19    industry simultaneously, even with big price
\par 
\par           20    increases.
\par 
\par           21              That seems a little bit suspicious.
\par 
\par           22    You could believe it might be happening in

\par 
\par 
\par            1    one or another industry for some reason, but
\par 
\par            2    not that it was all coming out of natural gas
\par 
\par            3    sector and not going into any other energy
\par 
\par            4    input sector.  So that led to a huge list
\par 
\par            5    having to do with unstable aggregates on a
\par 
\par            6    kind of technical side, but also
\par 
\par            7    environmental regulations,
\par 
\par            8    efficiency-oriented upgrades.
\par 
\par            9              I talked a little bit about what I
\par 
\par           10    hear from the refiners is that they can't
\par 
\par           11    build any new site, so they have to expand
\par 
\par           12    existing refineries.  Then they got air
\par 
\par           13    quality regs to deal with, so they have to
\par 
\par           14    make them both -- I think both more
\par 
\par           15    efficient.  And they have the opportunity to
\par 
\par           16    make it more efficient, but also
\par 
\par           17    less -- lower on emissions.
\par 
\par           18              And then there was a lot of
\par 
\par           19    discussion that came out nicely.  One
\par 
\par           20    interesting thing about the presentation is
\par 
\par           21    there were three sectors that we're focusing
\par 
\par           22    on, which is the refining sector, the ammonia

\par 
\par 
\par            1    sector -- they've got some generic name for
\par 
\par            2    the ammonia sector -- and the metals, which
\par 
\par            3    was mostly iron and steel.
\par 
\par            4              But it seemed like there was a
\par 
\par            5    different tentative hypothesis in each one.
\par 
\par            6    In the refining sector, I guess there were
\par 
\par            7    several hypotheses posited, and a couple
\par 
\par            8    additional ones added by the Committee that
\par 
\par            9    it might be buying -- importing
\par 
\par           10    almost-refined fuel so you didn't have to do
\par 
\par           11    as much hydrogenation -- internally
\par 
\par           12    (inaudible) actually talked a little bit
\par 
\par           13    about if you are generating hydrogen for
\par 
\par           14    hydrocracking in refineries, you usually use
\par 
\par           15    natural gas for that.
\par 
\par           16              So if either -- you're producing
\par 
\par           17    less natural gas, seems unlikely (inaudible)
\par 
\par           18    or importing things that are almost gasoline
\par 
\par           19    or gasoline by another name and then putting
\par 
\par           20    it through your system -- to do some -- I
\par 
\par           21    guess some detergent specs for the U.S. or
\par 
\par           22    something like that, that could be an

\par 
\par 
\par            1    explanation.
\par 
\par            2              In ammonia, it did seem like
\par 
\par            3    imports was a big potential explanatory
\par 
\par            4    factor.  In iron and steel, it seemed like it
\par 
\par            5    was any of those -- which I know work largely
\par 
\par            6    on scrap steel so they have much less overall
\par 
\par            7    energy, although the overall energy
\par 
\par            8    difference with respect to blast furnace
\par 
\par            9    technology is oftentimes largely coking coal.
\par 
\par           10              So I guess what we were struggling
\par 
\par           11    with at the end -- exhausted at that
\par 
\par           12    point -- was to maybe we could help you
\par 
\par           13    develop a kind of a strategic list of things
\par 
\par           14    to do first and second.  I guess the other
\par 
\par           15    thing I should add is a gr\ltrpar oup where John
\par 
\par           16    Conti was the ringleader said stay away from
\par 
\par           17    refineries, they're too complicated, nobody
\par 
\par           18    is talking there.
\par 
\par           19              It would probably be good to pick
\par 
\par           20    an industry that's a little bit simpler, and
\par 
\par           21    where people are likely to be more open, like

\par 
\par            4              One other thing that came
\par 
\par            5    up -- what Tom called the "denominator
\par

\par 
\par            7    messing us up is the production indexes
\par 
\par            8    themselves.   And there was a suggestion to
\par 
\par            9    look at IMPLAN -- at another group that does
\par 
\par           10    production indicies and at least the level of
\par 
\par           11    aggregation of the (inaudible) just as a
\par 
\par           12    (inaudible).  I would say not because

\par           13    (inaudible) somebody seeing one model

\par           19              Background factor here is that
\par 
\par           20    power plants -- non-grid power plants with in
\par

\par            1              A sample is strong for monthly
\par 
\par            2    reporting, and even if you're not monthly
\par 
\par            3    reporting a sample, you provide annual data.
\par 
\par            4    So backup data are available on all possible
\par 
\par            5    responses.
\par 
\par            6              Previously, the sampling -- but
\par 
\par            7    with the previous forms but within this
\par 
\par            8    population, previously the sampling has been
\par 
\par            9    using model-based sampling with a cut-off on
\par 
\par           10    capacity within various -- where you could
\par 
\par           11    call them strata (?) this model base maybe
\par 
\par           12    it's best to call them groups based on
\par 
\par           13    facility type fuel and region.
\par 
\par           14              A new procedure has been designed,
\par 
\par           15    which is somewhat more elaborate.  It starts
\par 
\par           16    with a capacity cut-off.  Next, facilities
\par 
\par           17    are added, which did not make the capacity
\par 
\par           18    cut-off, but have high generation volumes, if
\par 
\par           19    I understood that correctly.
\par 
\par           20              Next, facilities are added to make
\par 
\par           21    sure that there's at least 10 observations
\par 
\par           22    per group.

\par

\par 
\par            4    plants, commercial service and industrial
\par 
\par            5    facilities.  And then finally, 200 large gas
\par 
\par            6    facilities that were already reporting on are
\par 
\par            7    added in.  So that's what we were given, and
\par 
\par            8    we had some discussion around that.
\par 
\par            9              In the spirit of faithfulness, I'll
\par 
\par           10    say that a good chunk of the discussion was
\par 
\par           11    people who were coming from design-based
\par 
\par           12    sampling, a training, getting their minds
\par 
\par           13    around model-based sampling.  So we had a
\par 
\par           14    little bit of that.
\par 
\par           15              As far as the whole idea for why
\par 
\par           16    are there these five steps, Ed Kokkelenberg
\par 
\par           17    suggested that one possibility would be that
\par 
\par           18    a relative standard error, or whatever the
\par 
\par           19    price range might be relative standard error
\par 
\par           20    reduction step by step might be presented to
\par 
\par           21    show why each of these steps was being
\par

\par 
\par            2              Moshe raised various questions
\par 
\par            3    centering around the model-based procedure,
\par 
\par            4    the stability of the model.  It was pointed
\par 
\par            5    out that the -- to some extent the size of
\par 
\par            6    the sample, but the continuity of the sample,
\par 
\par            7    the annual data at the end provide protection
\par 
\par            8    in this regard.
\par 
\par            9              Moshe raised some concerns about
\par 
\par           10    (inaudible) strong area estimates using the
\par 
\par           11    model-based methods, and there was some
\par 
\par           12    discussion around this issue.
\par 
\par           13              Ed Kokkelenberg raised questions
\par 
\par           14    that fuel type was implicitly (inaudible)
\par 
\par           15    with the procedure in that it formed one of
\par 
\par           16    the grouping characteristics.  But I think
\par 
\par           17    it's fair to say that this would be addressed
\par 
\par           18    simply by showing the selection grid.
\par 
\par           19              Beyond that, I'm not sure we had a
\par 
\par           20    lot to say.
\par 
\par           21              Moshe suggested that for the

\par            1    were being generated, that those estimates
\par 
\par            2    could be summed up and compared against their
\par 
\par            3    annual report, and that this could be used
\par 
\par            4    (a) to evaluate the performance of the model,
\par 
\par            5    but be generally to gain insights from any
\par 
\par            6    systematic errors.
\par 
\par            7              So for example, if everybody who
\par 
\par            8    was being misestimated was in the Northeast,
\par 
\par            9    maybe that gives some insight on what might
\par 
\par           10    be happening in the Northeast, and could feed
\par 
\par           11    into model improvement.
\par 
\par           12              And then the last thing I have is
\par 
\par           13    that I noted that looking at forms, the forms
\par 
\par           14    and sample were (inaudible) but because of
\par 
\par           15    high overlap between the old samples and new
\par 
\par           16    samples (inaudible) are the effects of form
\par 
\par           17    (inaudible).  That's what I have (inaudible).
\par 
\par           18              MR. FEDER:  I just want to say I
\par 
\par           19    think the presentation was very good, that
\par 
\par           20    the method is very plausible.  One of the
\par 
\par           21    comments I made was that I think the title
\par 
\par           22    was a bit different from what we heard.  It's

\par 
\par 
\par            1    not actually a model-based sampling as much
\par 
\par            2    as sampling for a model-based estimation.
\par 
\par            3    But they're both just fine.
\par 
\par            4              My suggestion was more diagnostic,
\par 
\par            5    since we were asked to comment on how the
\par 
\par            6    method could be improved, and I suggested to
\par 
\par            7    look at what I called another project in the
\par 
\par            8    (inaudible) of closure since the end of the
\par 
\par            9    year, you couldn't prepare the reported value
\par 
\par           10    as (inaudible) was the estimates that have
\par 
\par           11    been prepared up to that point.
\par 
\par           12              But I think there's nothing wrong
\par 
\par           13    with the approach.  In fact, it makes a lot
\par 
\par           14    of sense to me.  I liked it.  And as you
\par 
\par           15    said, the heavy (inaudible) estimates adds
\par 
\par           16    robustness to the approach.
\par 
\par           17              MR. NEERCHAL:  Okay, thank you.
\par 
\par           18              MR. WEYANT:  Actually, I forgot to
\par 
\par           19    mention and probably should have, that ties
\par 
\par           20    into this I think if I understand the inent
\par 
\par           21    here is this -- again, at refiners, you're

\par 
\par            2    things in addition to importing things,
\par 
\par            3    moving things offsite so you would basically
\par 
\par            4    build a cogen plant right over the fence and
\par 
\par            5    sell back in the steam and the electricity
\par 
\par            6    both that way.  Would this survey kind of get

\par 
\par            8              MS. KIRKENDALL:  MECS would not
\par 
\par            9    pick that up because that's based on an
\par 
\par           10    established month.  They would draw a box
\par 
\par           11    around the refinery and they wouldn't
\par 
\par           12    (inaudible) cogen outside.

\par           13              SPEAKER:  Yeah, aid (?) surveys
\par 
\par           14    would pick it up because we follow up
\par 
\par           15    facilities that have anything to do.  That's
\par 
\par           16    one reason why some of our things aren't

\par           18    both the short-term but also in the modeling;
\par

\par            4    electricity generation, and we divide it up,
\par 
\par            5    I believe -- I'm not an expert -- (inaudible)
\par 
\par            6    but then we have what we call the electric
\par 
\par            7    power sector, which are NAICS -- which are
\par 
\par            8    the utilities, and also the -- what are
\par 
\par            9    called NAICS 22, I guess the -- those
\par 
\par           10    companies.
\par 
\par           11              We also have what we call the
\par 
\par           12    (inaudible) Tower, which the steam generation
\par 
\par           13    part of it is a significant part of the

\par           18    NEMS, we do can carry those kind of as a
\par 
\par           19    separate -- we have -- by fuel, by electric
\par 
\par           20    power sector, and buy the (inaudible) power

\par 
\par           10    megawatts you're talking about deals with
\par 
\par           11    423s -- the forms --
\par 
\par           12              MR. HODGE:  For fuel cost?
\par 
\par           13              MR. DOUGLAS:  Yeah, that comes off
\par 
\par           14    of those.  What we were more talking about
\par 
\par           15    was the 906/920, which has varying capacity
\par 
\par           16    cut-offs depending on fuel grouping.  Like I
\par 
\par           17    think currently natural gas is 200 megawatts
\par 
\par           18    is their capacity cut-off.
\par 
\par           19              MR. HODGE:  For like CHP plants
\par 
\par           20    even?
\par 
\par           21              MR. DOUGLAS:  I believe it's also
\par

\par 
\par 
\par            1    for almost all of them.  I don't think there
\par 
\par            2    are any differences among facilities.  We
\par 
\par            3    have published documents outlining
\par 
\par            4    them -- saying the regulated or the IPP or
\par 
\par            5    the commercial/industrial natural gas, the
\par 
\par            6    cut-offs are these, but they're all the same
\par 
\par            7    if I remember correctly.
\par 
\par            8              The 50 megawatts comes in because
\par 
\par            9    anything below 50 megawatts never even
\par 
\par           10    reports a 423 form -- either to (inaudible)
\par 
\par           11    or to EIA depending on whether they're
\par 
\par           12    regulated or un-regulated  -- so that's
\par 
\par           13    something (inaudible).
\par 
\par           14              I don't believe any of the fuel
\par 
\par           15    groups go down that low other than maybe the
\par 
\par           16    other category which covers waste and things

\par           17    like that.
\par 
\par           18              MR. HODGE:  The question I guess I
\par 
\par           19    had was whether the new Form 923 is going to
\par 
\par           20    allow a greater number of smaller CHP plants
\par 
\par           21    to report, like, say, natural gas consumption

\par 
\par 
\par            1              MR. DOUGLAS:  No.  In fact, the
\par 
\par            2    commercial and industrial centers were the
\par 
\par            3    two facility types that we tried to cut on
\par 
\par            4    the sample more than the regulated in IPP.
\par 
\par            5    And that was kind of an electric power
\par 
\par            6    division decision coming from the top.
\par 
\par            7              So even if it's -- regardless of
\par 
\par            8    whether it's sampled or reports annually or
\par 
\par            9    monthly is beside the point; for the fuel
\par 
\par           10    costs and fuel receipts, as it is currently
\par 
\par           11    stands, if you're -- even if you're sampled
\par 
\par           12    monthly and you're under 50 megawatts, you
\par 
\par           13    don't ever have to report your receipts.
\par 
\par           14    They are keeping that rule going forward at

\par 
\par           18    the new 923 --
\par 
\par           19              MR. DOUGLAS:  We're cutting the
\par

\par 
\par           21    still report annually.

\par

\par 
\par           11    either the 906 data or the new 923 for
\par 
\par           12    industrial cogen might help Kobi in some of

\par           17    it's a cogen that's not connected to the

\par           18    grid, they're just using all of it for their

\par

\par 
\par           10    had Margot talk about the 30th anniversary
\par 
\par           11    earlier on, and we didn't have a whole lot of

\par 
\par           10    little bit of feedback, we didn't get a lot
\par

\par           16              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  The conference
\par 
\par           17    is going to be on a Tuesday.
\par 
\par           18              MS. JENNINGS:  That's Monday,
\par 
\par           19    Tuesday.
\par 
\par           20              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Monday and
\par 
\par           21    Tuesday.
\par 
\par           22              MS. JENNINGS:  So if the Thursday,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    Friday prior to that would be a good time.
\par 
\par            2    Or maybe the following Thursday or Friday?
\par 
\par            3    Really, that is one of the (inaudible)
\par 
\par            4              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  You say you're
\par 
\par            5    waiting for more responses?
\par 
\par            6              MS. JENNINGS:  Waiting for more
\par 
\par            7    responses.  Right.
\par 
\par            8              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Normally, we do
\par 
\par            9    this Thursday or Friday.
\par 
\par           10              MS. JENNINGS:  Thursday or Friday.
\par 
\par           11              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  And I am
\par 
\par           12    indifferent.  Because I'll be here for both
\par 
\par           13    events, but is it possible the Committee
\par 
\par           14    would want them in the same week but pushed
\par 
\par           15    closer together?
\par 
\par           16              MS. JENNINGS:  If that is a
\par 
\par           17    possibility?
\par 
\par           18              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  That's an option
\par 
\par           19    to do it, I guess; right?
\par 
\par           20              MS. JENNINGS:  As far as I know.  I
\par 
\par           21    think that is just tradition.
\par 
\par           22              You'd have to push them together,

\par 
\par 
\par            1    without a day in between?  So it'd be the
\par 
\par            2    same week but Thursday, Friday.
\par 
\par            3              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  But it's not --
\par 
\par            4              MS. JENNINGS:  Where you are --
\par 
\par            5              SPEAKER:  You mean Wednesday and
\par 
\par            6    Thursday?
\par 
\par            7              SPEAKER:  Wednesday and Thursday.
\par 
\par            8              MS. JENNINGS:  Wednesday and
\par 
\par            9    Thursday.  Sorry.
\par 
\par           10              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  The only problem
\par 
\par           11    is that people teach.  So they're going to
\par 
\par           12    have to disrupt on Wednesday.
\par 
\par           13              MS. KHANNA:  It will disrupt a week
\par 
\par           14    either way.
\par 
\par           15              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Yeah, if you go
\par 
\par           16    to both, they're both disruptive.  Yeah,
\par 
\par           17    something is disrupted, so you might as well
\par 
\par           18    stay down there Monday through Thursday or
\par 
\par           19    Monday through Friday.
\par 
\par           20              SPEAKER:  The idea is that it will
\par 
\par           21    be a conference that will put SERA week (?)
\par 
\par           22    to shame, and it won't cost anything.

\par            1              I think the program is actually is

\par 
\par            3    people --
\par 
\par            4              SPEAKER:  I like having them the
\par 
\par            5    same week.
\par 
\par            6              SPEAKER:  The two on the same week.
\par 
\par            7    And a day in the middle -- I mean obviously
\par 
\par            8    it --
\par 
\par            9              SPEAKER:  The ideal would be a
\par 
\par           10    Wednesday, Thursday just traditional --
\par 
\par           11              MS. KIRKENDALL:  We can always
\par 
\par           12    change that -- if that makes it easier.  This
\par 
\par           13    is a one-time thing in honor of the 30th
\par 
\par           14    anniversary.  We could have some --
\par 
\par           15              SPEAKER:  Well, the only question
\par 
\par           16    is can you get this facility Wednesday,
\par 
\par           17    Thursday, rather than Thursday, Friday?
\par 
\par           18              SPEAKER:  We have never tried --
\par 
\par           19              MS. JENNINGS:  I would think that
\par 
\par           20    it would be just as easy, I'm guessing, but
\par 
\par           21    I --

\par 
\par            3              SPEAKER:  The other one?

\par

\par

\par 
\par            7    would also be like -- would it be more like
\par 
\par            8    the middle of April more?  Moving it up a
\par 
\par            9    little bit.
\par 
\par           10              SPEAKER:  Yes, it's a little
\par 
\par           11    earlier.
\par 
\par           12              SPEAKER:  Yes, it was a little
\par 
\par           13    earlier.  That's not a problem for anybody?
\par 
\par           14              SPEAKER:  My only concern is that
\par 
\par           15    our people in the -- usually present their
\par 
\par           16    presentations here; right?  But is your staff
\par 
\par           17    going to be --
\par 
\par           18              SPEAKER:  I think we need global
\par 
\par           19    pooling for that --
\par 
\par           20              SPEAKER:  Just the afternoon --
\par 
\par           21              MS. KHANNA:  I had actually one
\par 
\par           22    suggestion that's just a little different

\par 
\par 
\par            1    from the discussion, which is because it's
\par 
\par            2    the EIA's 30th anniversary and I think this
\par 
\par            3    Committee \ltrpar has been in existence for a big
\par 
\par            4    chunk of those 30 years, it may not be bad to
\par 
\par            5    talk about the role of this committee,
\par 
\par            6    because I think this is kind of unusual, as a
\par 
\par            7    set of independent committee from outside
\par 
\par            8    that comes and provides input on what the EIA
\par 
\par            9    does.  That could be in one of the smaller
\par 
\par           10    sessions.
\par 
\par           11              But I think it will be important to
\par 
\par           12    find out when you -- if you have the session
\par 
\par           13    talking about how the EIA has evolved, and
\par 
\par           14    how we are working hard to make sure that
\par 
\par           15    products get only better over time.
\par 
\par           16    Somewhere in that grouping it may not be a
\par 
\par           17    bad idea to get -- to make things easier.
\par 
\par           18              MR. FEDER:  Since we always meet
\par 
\par           19    just for a day and a half, I wonder -- I
\par 
\par           20    mean, maybe people would disagree, if we had
\par 
\par           21    just one day meeting that Wednesday, and the
\par 
\par           22    session Neha said, was mentioning the day

\par 
\par 
\par            1    before.  I always felt I -- again for the
\par 
\par            2    locals, it might be different, but coming in
\par 
\par            3    for the two days and then having this short
\par 
\par            4    Friday meeting, which actually I know a few
\par 
\par            5    people will have to cut it short tomorrow
\par 
\par            6    anyway.
\par 
\par            7              Can we just squeeze it into one
\par 
\par            8    day?  To me, it's going to be a lot easier,
\par 
\par            9    but -- people might disagree, I don't know.
\par 
\par           10              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think that may be
\par 
\par           11    a relevant point, because as Tom was talking
\par 
\par           12    about, some presentations are already -- some
\par 
\par           13    other presenters are already busy, so you may
\par 
\par           14    have fewer presentations to make for the
\par 
\par           15    coming -- they make it like one time and have
\par 
\par           16    one short meeting.
\par 
\par           17              MR. FEDER:  So we could have what
\par 
\par           18    Neha's suggesting on Tuesday, and then a
\par 
\par           19    regular meeting on Wednesday, and catch up
\par 
\par           20    with the --
\par 
\par           21              MS. GRUENSPECHT:  We can possibly
\par 
\par           22    have -- there's extra space that we have at

\par            1    the Convention Center, I believe.  We have
\par 
\par            2    some small extra rooms, and then there's a
\par 
\par            3    possibility of doing a meeting at the
\par 
\par            4    Convention Center on Tuesday.  So if this is
\par 
\par            5    what they want.  I'm not trying to --
\par 
\par            6              MR. FEDER:  Well, we could have
\par 
\par            7    some -- we also, that -- the lunch where we
\par 
\par            8    discuss some committee businesses, so we
\par 
\par            9    could do it while the conference is going on.
\par 
\par           10    That's for sure.  And have the traditional
\par 
\par           11    Thursday dinner --
\par 
\par           12              SPEAKER:  On Wednesday.

\par            1    might be useful to have -- if there's a
\par 
\par            2    program or something being published in this
\par 
\par            3    context for the conference, have a history of
\par 
\par            4    this committee, like a one-pager put together
\par 
\par            5    by maybe Bill and someone --
\par 
\par            6              SPEAKER:  Before he leaves.
\par 
\par            7              MR. NEERCHAL:  If he's not here we
\par 
\par            8    will volunteer --
\par 
\par            9              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Actually, Cal
\par 
\par           10    Kent (?) did a history maybe six years ago,
\par 
\par           11    five years ago.  Something like that.  So we
\par 
\par           12    have one that we can start from.  We can look
\par 
\par           13    at it and work to update it.
\par 
\par           14              MS. JENNINGS:  It sounds like
\par 
\par           15    there's definite interest in people
\par 
\par           16    anticipating -- that you have only a day --
\par 
\par           17              SPEAKER:  A day here, maybe just a
\par 
\par           18    little bit (inaudible)--
\par 
\par           19              SPEAKER:  There's a meeting there
\par 
\par           20    Tuesday afternoon, have a day here.
\par 
\par           21              MR. NEERCHAL:  Overlap then
\par 
\par           22    slightly.

\par 
\par            1              I think this is time for inviting
\par 
\par            2    the public to comment.  The public --
\par 
\par            3              MR. RUTHERFORD:  The public once
\par 
\par            4    again remains silent.
\par 
\par            5              MR. NEERCHAL:  Silence means
\par 
\par            6    consent, then.
\par 
\par            7              We are adjourned for the day.
\par 
\par            8                   (Whereupon, at approximately 5:00

\par
