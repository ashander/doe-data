          3              DR. HENGARTEN:  All right, to

          4    order, enough of this Canadian thing.  Good

          5    morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  We have

          6    another day of work here today.  There is one

          7    announcement that I'd like to do before we

          8    start.  I'd like to invite Tom Rutherford to

          9    replace Mr. Cleveland's discussion and he

         10    will be summarizing the break-out session on

         11    the relationship between various price

         12    series, are future contracts good predictors

         13    of future spot prices.  So that's the one

         14    change to the program that I have to

         15    announce.

         16              Next thing, I'd like those who were

         17    not here yesterday to please introduce

         18    themselves.  If you can use the microphone

         19    over there that would be good.

         20              MS. ROBINSON:  Hi, my name is

         21    Ashley Robinson and I am here from the Census

         13              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I would like to

         14    introduce Joel.  He's going to be making the

         15    presentation for Lindolfo Pedraza.  Just to

         16    put this in context, in the past you have

         17    heard us talk about looking at outlier

         18    detection and various estimation methods for

         19    some of the electric power data, the monthly

         20    EIA 826, and there is an annual 861.

         21              Earlier this summer the same data

         22    were being used only a historical time series

          1    framework by people in support of STEO, the

          2    short-term energy outlook, down in the Office

          3    of Energy Markets and End Use.  And he

          4    observed that there are still some

          5    irregularities in the time series.  There are

          6    some errors that have snuck into data

          7    especially at the state level and so he

          8    talked to Lindolfo and Lindolfo got excited

          9    about trying these ideas by looking at the

         10    time series context.  And so that's how this

         11    stuff started.  He came back and talked to me

         12    —————————— do some work on it.

         13              So Lindolfo wanted to talk to you

         14    about his work and then two weeks ago he said

         15    oh, I'm going to Sweden, and so Joel is the

         16    one who gets stuck making the presentation

         17    today.  He was gracious enough to agree to do

         18    it.  So if we get into technical details and

         19    we don't know all the answers it's Lindolfo's

         20    fault.  He's not here.

          2    Errors, Structural Change, and Time Series

          5    Kirkendall of the DoE, more specifically the

          6    Statistical Methods Group, Joe Sedransk of

          7    that specific group also, and Lindolfo

          8    Pedraza of Science Applications International

          9    Corporation.  You went through Fred's story

         10    already so that's fine.

         11              The two purposes of this paper, one

         12    is they wanted to improve the methods of

         13    imputation for not only data nonrespondents

         14    within a survey but also data that has not

         15    been sampled within that survey which needs

         16    to be estimated for on a monthly basis as

         17    opposed to a yearly basis.  Again, a couple

         18    of months ago the data was being sifted

         19    through so that aggregates and databases of

         20    electricity generation and sales data could

         21    be compiled for forecasting techniques over

         22    at STEO.  The two forms that were being used

          1    at the time were EIA 826 and the Form 861,

          2    which I will go into in a little bit, but

          3    essentially 826 is a sample from the universe

          4    of 861.

          5              What the colleague hoped to find

          6    specifically in a Form 826 is the published

          7    versus the reported data.  If you look at the

          8    blue line it is consistently below the red

          9    line and its peaks are the peaks of the red

         10    line and its troughs are also the troughs of

         11    the red line.  The movement in sync is

         12    specifically what he was looking for and the

         13    spread between the two is made up for by the

         14    imputation system.  So essentially the

         15    reported data is the sample and the published

         16    data is a sample plus the imputed values.

         17              Here is another example.  This one

         18    is Mississippi residential sales.  The spread

         19    is a little bit different in this one, it's a

         20    little bit greater, but if you notice it's

         21    still consistent with the troughs and the

         22    peaks and everything moving in sync more or

          2    decade.

          3              The data, though, that he found was

          4    not always what he was expecting, as you can

          5    see in Colorado commercial sales.  Around

          6    June 1997 there was a significant dropoff in

          7    the reported 826 data.  This is to be

          8    expected in some cases when there's a very

          9    large nonrespondent although this was a

         10    significantly large nonrespondent if not more

         11    than one in that single month.

         12              But as you can see in the red

         13    published line the imputation system imputed

         14    for the missing respondents as well as all of

         15    the firms not sampled within the survey was

         16    made up for and that is the purpose of the

         17    imputation system.  The imputation system

         18    deals with things like this very, very well.

         19              And just to be clear, when I say

         20    impute I am not just speaking about imputing

         21    values for nonrespondent firms within the

         22    samples also imputing values for the non-

          2              If you look at New York residential

          3    sales you'll see a different kind of data

          4    error.  Obviously the previous error in

          5    Colorado was a lack of response or a

          6    misreported value in the less than category

          7    but here there was not a lack of reported

          8    value but there was a value that was reported

          9    in error.  Probably someone reported in

         10    kilowatts as opposed to megawatts or what

         11    have you.

         12              This type of problem is very vexing

         13    to the imputation system.  It doesn't deal

         14    with these problems very well and, as you can

         15    see, the data error reported in blue was not

         16    fully corrected for as seen by the published

         17    data in red.  It was dampened but it still

         18    existed throughout the published data.

         19              DR. HENGARTEN:  Joel, if there was

         20    an error like kilowatts instead of megawatts

         21    why does the blue line start to go up slowly?

          4    someone reports badly the whole thing would

          5    go up.  It wouldn't be a trend.

          6              MS. KIRKENDALL:  The other thing

          7    that gets complicated in figuring out some of

          8    these things is that after the data are

          9    published there you collect the data, you

         10    benchmark to the most recent 861, and then at

         11    the end of the year they adjust the monthly

         12    numbers so they add up to the annual number

         13    that reflects that year.  And so you have to

         20    the reported data.  We're talking about the

         10    really designed to fix problems like this.

         11    The question that the paper addresses is is

         12    it possible for the imputation system to fix

         13    problems like this.  Are there certain

          2    the frame of which the monthly sample can be

          3    drawn.  The data collected is at the firm

          4    level and state level and broken into four

          5    sectors, the commercial, the residential, the

          6    industrial, and the transportation sectors.

          7              Form EIA 826 is the monthly sample

          8    that's collected from the 861.  It is a

          9    cut-off sample.  The remaining nonsample

         10    firms are given an estimated or an imputed

         11    value on a monthly basis; therefore, every

         12    month you have a value whether imputed or

         13    reported for every single firm in the 861 but

         14    it's referred to for the rest of this

         15    presentation as 826 published data because

         16    it's not 861 census annual data.

         17              The survey sampling methodology for

         18    the 826 is they use of cut-off sample due to

         19    the skewed nature of electricity sales and

         20    generation.  A weighted regression is used to

         21    refute for the nonsample data.  This is also

         22    due to the skewness of the sample.  The

          2    reported values plus the sum of all the

          5    you in Colorado and New York was the reported

          6    and then the reported plus the imputed, so

          7    just to revise that.

          8              The first data cleaning technique

          9    was used before we even reached regression

         10    imputation.  It is called scatter plot

         11    editing.  It allows data analysts to compare

         12    the currently reported data to previously

         13    reported data or previously reported

         14    aggregate data depending on what you choose.

         16    data that stands out from its peers and more

         18    reported values.  In a perfect world that

         19    this would be the best way to catch them but

         20    obviously things slip by especially when you

          8              Pretty much the heart of the paper

          9    dealt with data versus expectations.  There

         10    is a need to reconcile the survey sampling

         18    variable or a reported value plus lagged,

         19    reported, or estimated values.  The question,

          1    analyzing these problems was that they first

          9    process by which to impute from missing and

         10    nonsampled data for cross monthly comparisons

         11    as well as cross yearly comparisons.

         12    Hopefully the newly estimated line matches

         13    closer with the historical line.  Otherwise

         14    the relationship needs to start over because

         15    we need a base of not only the imputation

         16    system but a time series language to compare

         17    other alternative imputation methods.

         18              And, as you can see, the 861 and

         19    826 re-estimated line matches up quite well

         20    with the original until you get about 2002

         21    when the relationship seems to break down for

         22    some reason, not quite known why but it's

          1    actually very close and, as Nancy pointed out

          2    a few days ago, there are very few changes

          3    within the imputation system over the years,

          4    mostly stratification levels, different

          5    samples being taken, and such.

          6              But as you can see we have a nice

          7    base right now for comparison of the time

          8    series as well from now we can take this

          9    imputation system that created these lines

         10    and add or subtract stuff and attempt to fix

         11    data errors.

         12              As I previously discussed, scatter

         13    plots, first two were used in trying to

         14    uncover data errors within both 826 and 861.

         15    The next three methods are as follows.  The

         16    second method was to incorporate automatic

         17    outlier and influential observation

         18    detection.

         19              I will explain how we detect those

         20    in a minute and that method would be treated

         21    as erroneous or bad data and would be

         22    overwritten with an imputed value just as if

          1    they were a nonrespondent.  The second would

          2    be to take those outlying and influential

          3    observations and treat them as add-ons, that

          4    is, assume their value is good but do not add

          5    them into the model and do not let its large

          6    effects rain in on the other estimated or

          7    imputed values for either sample or

          8    nonrespondent.

          9              The third method is the

         10    experimental method which Lindolfo had

         11    started right before he had left to go to

         12    Sweden or Denmark or wherever he is this

         13    week.  And he used the seemingly unrelated

         14    regression model or the SUR model, which I

         21    predicted value.  The way Nancy and Joe and

         22    Lindolfo decided to uncover these

          1    observations, they used DFFITS, greater than

          2    two over the square root of the count.  An

          3    outlying observation is one with a

          4    considerable rift between its reported value

          5    and its predicted value and they use a

          6    studentized residual on that one greater than

          7    3.5.

          8              There are probably different

          9    methods to calculating these and as of right

         10    now both an influential and the outlying

         11    observations are treated as the same whereas

         12    you could probably in some cases treat

         13    influential observations as add-ons and treat

         14    outlying observations as erroneous data to be

         15    imputed for.

         16              So the second step after scatter

         17    plots would be to re-estimate the 826 line by

         18    detecting the outliers and influential and

         19    imputing for their values.  This, of course,

         20    is the extreme position on the other side of

         21    detecting them as add-ons.  Detecting 861

          5    were mixed.

          6              If you look in January 1994 the

          7    original trend of the time series was kept

          8    intact all the way almost into 1995 but, as

          9    you can see, it was not necessary because the

         10    shock up still occurred.  It was not just a

         11    yearly shock that was go back down through

         12    this little time series line.  In some cases

         13    the EIA 861 and 826 re-estimated or muted

         14    some of the shock.  In some cases they

          4    here and the data jumps up the imputation

          8    the data jumps up again.  So it's probably

         10    point.  There were data errors that were not

          1    side comment for our discussion yesterday,

          2    this is an example of something that should

          3    be flagged or should have been flagged but

          4    still if that data --

          5              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Well, but this is

          6    just ongoing.  I mean, we just discovered

          7    these funny data points this year.

          8              MR. BERNSTEIN:  Right, well, but

          9    now you know this one.  Whoever that data is

         10    should be flagged and said if you're going to

         11    use pre-1994 data in this time series be

         12    aware that it does this strange thing.  And

         13    once you know it somebody's got to write a

         14    little sticky and make a memo out of it.

         15              DR. EDMONDS:  Actually it looks

         16    like you've already imputed backwards.

         17              MS. KIRKENDALL:  We're going to

         18    have to figure how to do that.

         19              MR. HILL:  If I remember the state

         20    it said Colorado was the one where there was

         21    a very large low outlier.  It was one of your

          2              MR. DOUGLAS:  Yes, Colorado was the

          3    one but it wasn't the industrial.  It was the

          4    commercial sector.

          5              MR. HILL:  Is it different?

          6              MR. DOUGLAS:  Yes.

          7              DR. SITTER:  Could I ask a

          8    question?  You said this was calculated by

          9    year?

         10              MR. DOUGLAS:  Yes, it's calculated

         11    on a monthly basis but if you have 1994 it's

         12    using 1993 as its regressor year and when we

         13    get to 1995 it uses 1994.  So when you had

         14    the shock up in 1994 and then with the newly

         15    estimated it's taking out the influential and

         16    outlier observations in both 861 and 826 so

         17    it's reading a different set of data points

         18    than the other one.

         19              And then in a similar example we

         20    have the Arizona residential sales.  If you

         21    look at the red line it's well within the

         22    yellow and the blue lines.  The peaks and the

          1    troughs and the extremes are not nearly as

          2    much and that was when both again were

          3    re-estimated and for comparison purposes the

          4    blue line is just 861 re-estimated with

          5    outliers influential detected and imputed

          6    for, not 826.

          7              So you can see the difference

          8    between the two lines but it almost mirrors

          9    the original data.  So some of the extreme

         10    data points on a monthly basis were not

         11    corrected for or in this case if it even

         12    needs to be corrected for.  It is more of a

         13    comparison.  You see in almost every single

         14    case the red line maybe prints half of the

         15    way up the peaks and the troughs of the

         16    yellow and the blue line.

         17              So again the results mixed.  Maybe

         18    the red line is better.  Maybe it's taking

         19    out points or good data and should not be

         20    overwritten and the blue and the yellow line

         21    are more correct.

         10    under the yellow.

         11              DR. NEERCHAL:  Then it should be

         13              MR. DOUGLAS:  The third method,

         14    like I said, was to create 826 influential

         15    and outlier observations as add-ons, assuming

         16    that their reported data was good and the

         17    value was kept intact but it was not kept in

         18    the regression model so the value did not

         19    affect the imputation or estimation of other

         20    nonsampled or nonrespondent firms.  And again

         21    the results were mixed, as you can see.

          1    line before 1995 actually made data worse for

          2    some reason.  From 1995 until about 2001 it

          3    mirrored it pretty well, didn't change it all

          4    that much.  In 2002 it made it worse and then

          5    2003 it actually made it a little bit more

          6    consistent.

          7              So of these three methods discussed

          8    so far none of them really deals with any of

          9    the extreme data points that we've seen in

         10    some of the historical data or would have if

         11    they had been incorporated at the time the

         12    data was collected.  So the two conclusions

         13    of these three methods are that automatic

         14    outlier and influential detection is not a

         15    global solution to deal with bad or erroneous

         16    data points coming through in the reported

         17    data and existing in the published data.

         18              And a more positive conclusion is

         19    that possibly the detection of outliers and

         20    influentials could help analysts use scatter

         21    plots and run a regression and color code the

         22    most statistically significant points within

          2    efforts to those plants which need the most

          3    attention.

          4              The final method that they tried,

          5    again with seemingly unrelated regressors,

          6    this is still very experimental.  In fact I

          7    just got an e-mail from Lindolfo this morning

          8    with a bunch more graphs.  I think you got it

          9    too saying look at these, aren't they really

         10    cool, and they go along with some of the

         11    graphs I'm about ready to show you.

         12              SUR allows for information feedback

         13    across regressor groups.  It uses more

         14    information than other regression types,

         15    different co-variance relationships and it

         16    also utilizes different strata.  I'm sure

         17    Nancy could go into that a little bit more if

         18    there are questions on that.

         19              This example was the one we used

         20    back in the outlier influential detection.

         21    As you can see with the SUR method, the blue

         22    line, that shock we were just talking about,

          1    the re-estimated one delayed it for a year

          2    but then it still shocked up.  With SUR it

          3    smoothed it out and was not a single shock

          4    but it's more of a consistent time series.

          5    But if you notice in the middle about 1998

          6    the SUR creates more extreme peaks and

          7    troughs than the outlier influential

          8    detection method used previously.

          9              And then finally New York

         10    residential sales was the second example that

         11    I gave you.  If you notice the point in

         12    December of 1999 of reported data that went

         13    through to the published data the SUR method

         14    actually smoothed that out although the model

         15    completely broke down in 2002 for some

         16    unknown reason and created more extreme peaks

         17    and troughs in the early '90s but the

         18    original problem of that one outlying point

         19    was solved although it did cause other

         20    problems, overall positive but mixed.

         21              MS. KIRKENDALL:  More work needed.

         21    passenger vehicle mileage forecasts and I

         22    thought I have no idea how to do this.  So I

          1    talked to a friend of mine and she said well,

          2    this is very easy.  She said passenger

          3    vehicle miles are highly correlated with

          4    population and land area, land area is not

          5    going to change, and our friends at Census

          6    provide very good population forecasts, so do

          7    the cross-sectional regression and once you

          8    have those regressional results use the

          9    population forecasts to drive the forecasts

         10    for the vehicle miles.

         11              It worked very well and this is in

         12    a sense a probably more elegant example of

         13    the same type of methodology where you're

         14    using cross-sectional estimations to help not

         15    drive forecasts as much as tune them and so

         16    at the broadest level I find it to be very

         17    satisfying mostly because it reflects what I

         18    might have tried to do if I'd been given the

         19    job.

         20              Beyond that I have mostly just a

         21    lot of questions and I don't think that I can

         22    say anything that will add to the methodology

          1    but I do have some questions that might help

          2    someone else do that.  It seems like in the

          3    examples that are used that the sample values

          4    before the imputation are almost consistently

          5    under the values that result after the

          6    imputation so I'm wondering if there's

          7    something within the sampling process that's

          8    leading to that consistent under-reporting.

          9              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Well, I think

         10    that's just because it's from a sample, it's

         11    not from the total, and then the published

         12    line is an estimate for the total.  So the

         13    sum of all the data reported on the sample

         14    will always be less than the estimated total.

         15              DR. BURTON:  So the difference

         16    between the two is the actual difference

         17    between the annual total and the firms in the

         18    sample that weren't a part of the sample?  Is

         19    that what you are saying?

         20              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes, the

         21    difference between those two is the

         22    estimation that we made for those companies

          2              DR. BURTON:  The second question I

          3    have is from the discussion it sounds like

          4    the regression that forms a basis for the

          5    imputation is simply regressing against the

          6    annual values.  There's other information

          7    available for the firm on an annual basis.

          8    Has there been any thought of modifying that

          9    regression to include more information that

         10    might tighten to fit some?  I have no idea

         11    whether that would be productive but --

         12              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Jim Knobb in CNEAF

         13    has done a lot of work with these regression

         14    equations and I believe he has tried multiple

         15    regressors.  Particularly he has tried

         16    capacity.

         17              DR. BURTON:  That was one without

         18    any real improvement of it?

         20    energy and things like that.

         21              DR. BURTON:  Well, the idea is to

         22    keep the regressions as simple as possible

          1    unless you have got something that adds

          2    appreciably to the fit.  So, I mean, if that

          3    makes me feel better at least somebody else

          4    already had the same idea that I had.  And

          5    along those lines, Nick, I want you to know

          6    that I have a note here that says why the

          7    run-up in data errors for New York

          8    residential so I'd actually written it down

          9    before you said it.

         10              DR. HENGARTEN:  Good job.  I'll

         11    take your word for it.

         12              DR. BURTON:  Another question that

         13    I had is does the set of sampled firms change

         14    over time and if so in what way?

         15              MS. KIRKENDALL:  It has changed

         16    over time.  I mean, this is a survey that

         17    started in certainly early '90s and we had in

         18    the frame everybody that we knew about.  And

         19    since then, of course, people have tracked

         20    the industry and added firms to the frame.

         21    They've also observed errors in the

         22    estimation and when they thought that the

          1    errors were too big they'd add a few firms.

          2    There have been changes in the industry in

          3    the early 2000s with deregulation and so they

          4    changed certain ———————————— firms.

          5              DR. BURTON:  Firm mergers?

          6              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Well,

          7    deregulation, they're no longer regulated

          8    now.  They're public firms and we've changed

          9    how we treat them.  So there have been

         10    changes over time and this isn't always true

         11    either but usually they make the changes with

         12    January data but they'd add firms to a

         13    sample.

         16    the data points that are at issue?

         17              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Maybe.  I think so

         18    far what's happened is they've run all the

         19    methodology but we haven't really gone in to

         20    look into the detail to see what caused funny

         21    things and that's probably a step that we

          1              DR. BURTON:  The last question I

          2    have, and I apologize.  Again I have a very

          3    little to offer in terms of guidance and just

          4    a lot of questions but the last question I

          5    have is one of the purported goals as I read

          6    this was to try and distinguish between data

          7    issues and actual economic shocks.  And I

          8    wasn't convinced that I was seeing how that

          9    happened and it's not the first time I've

         10    missed something but if you can help me see

         11    how this does that because that's a

         12    tremendously important thing to do.

         13              If it's an actual data shock then

         14    you've got to leave it and let it have

         15    whatever influence it has.  If it's an

         16    economic shock it should be there.  If it's a

         17    data issue then you want to try and remove

         18    the influence.  I couldn't quite see how that

         19    distinction was being made so if either one

         20    of you --

         21              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I'm not sure we

         22    are making that distinction yet.  I think

          1    what's been tried so far is this automatic

          2    detection.  You call them all outliers,

          3    either take them all out, don't use them at

          4    all and impute for them, or take them out of

          5    the regression but add them back in.  I don't

          6    think the solution is that if you do it all

          7    completely automatic.  I think Joel said

          8    that.  So you probably do need to rely on

          9    somebody who's going to talk to the company

         10    and find out whether it was a real data

         11    point.  You'll just never get out of having

         12    some of that go on although in other venues

         13    we've had problems, as you heard, that

         14    respondents are not as knowledgeable as they

         15    used to be in this area.  I got it off of

         20    Sometimes you probably can look at

         22    point of time and say oh, yeah, that's when

         18    York residential generation the large spike

         19    up that occurred in December of 1999.  That

          1    nontransitory, I mean, spikes are one thing.

          2    There you had a nontransitory shift where it

          4    stayed there and from an analytical

         19    little bit of added pressure on the lead

          1              DR. NEERCHAL:  So it ended and I

          2    think that a lot of the details brought up

          3    today I think will really help if they are

          4    part of the documentation.  For example, the

          5    fact that the equation of known plus unknown

          6    in a classical sampling paradigm, seen plus

          7    unseen kind of concept, I mean, it was very

          8    useful for me to really see it even though I

          9    was trying to get that from him.  So you are

         10    doing a really good job.

         11              And I think that I come to this

         12    from a different angle because I'm a

         13    statistician.  I'm a you can say closet

         14    econometrician because my advisor was an

         15    econometrician and so I understand some of

         16    the language but in general people may not

         17    understand this.

         18              So the first thing I would say that

         19    it seems to me that the objective is to

         20    impute data.  Now, impute obvious errors I

         21    think like megawatt being mistaken for

         22    kilowatt and things like that, in that case

          8    reason why it is.  That is a prediction

          9    problem in a way and you can call it impute

         10    because it is in the middle of the data.

         11              And I wondered what exactly is

         12    fixing.  Is it just enough to catch them or

         13    you want a method that is robust with respect

         14    to these things?  Those are questions that I

         15    couldn't quite get an answer to in the

         16    documentation.  So I would like to see some

         17    discussion there saying what does it mean to

         18    say you have a method that's working.  I

         19    think it would be nice if there is

         20    description of that somewhere.  And I think I

         21    would do that.

          1    specific.  I believe seemingly unrelated

          2    regression, the name was coined by Zellner

          3    (?) because saying there are two regression

          4    equations they should not really be thought

          5    of any way related.  Maybe it's the economy

          6    of Japan, it's the economy of another

          7    country, and he just said if you put them

          8    together, do the regression simultaneously,

          9    you can get some small sample efficiency

         10    gain.

         11              I think it is small sample

         12    efficiency gain because you really are using

         13    the same data as you did earlier.  You just

         14    use the correlations to do a second stage

         15    estimation so as regarding that it will tell

         16    a different story.  So I think that in this

         17    case on the other hand there are unrelated at

         18    all.  It has different states.  There are

         19    some borrowing and lending going on between

         20    states.

         21              So it's an obvious thing to do a

         11              DR. NEERCHAL:  Or unseemingly

         12    related so it seems to me that it's an

         13    obvious thing to do and I think this was

         14    actually partly brought out last time I think

         15    when Joel presented something related to

         16    these data that it was brought out.  How come

         17    you're not borrowing strengths.  I think the

         18    committee had brought this up, I remember.  I

         19    think that seems to me an obvious thing to do

         20    but on some references in the documentation

         21    like the correspondence between regression

         22    estimators and the ratio estimators, those

          1    relationships have to be explored under the

          2    measurement error ———————— because ratio

          3    estimators are like regression without

          4    intercept in a sense but that will assume

          5    that X with no measurements error or Y with

          6    measurement error and so some details are

          7    there and those technical details are to be

          8    brought out.  We cannot say in general one

          9    beats the other.  I don't think it's possible

         10    to do that.  And so this is obviously a very

         11    data-driven problem and I really like it,

         12    though.  I think this is really useful to do

         13    it using all the states together.  We should

         14    try to do it as a system.

         15              Some specific things that maybe I

         16    should probably volunteer later.  Even if you

         17    do them one state at a time you still get

         18    unbiased estimates.  Only when you do them

         19    together you get a more efficient estimate.

         20    That's the reality.  They're not biased in

         21    any way.  I don't think that is the reason

         22    why they are different.

          1              I think these are also driven by

          2    the e-mail that Bill sent to us later, the

          3    e-mail exchange between Jim Knobb and there

          4    was an e-mail if you would forward it to us

          5    later on.  There's some comment about there

          6    are some production issues.  It cannot be

          7    implemented during production.  That's hard

          8    for me to comment on that one that I don't

          9    know but I'm looking at it from a

         10    statistician's point of view.

         11              It seems to me that you have to do

         12    them together.  So if you can borrow strength

         13    from other states you have to try to do that,

         14    I think, at least see how much you gain.  So

         16    possible.

         17              And one thing occurred to me during

         18    the presentation.  It seems to me that when

         19    you do seemingly unrelated the differences

         20    become less tractable because of the

         21    smoothing.  That is the other side of

         22    smoothing because before you smooth I asked

          1    him why it's jumped.  He could easily explain

          2    well, it looks like some data points are not

          3    cleaned and they were being left in the data

          4    segments and so on.  Easy to explain why the

          5    differences are but the moment you put this

          6    seemingly unrelated stuff because it is

          7    borrowing stuff from everywhere it is very

          8    hard to tell why the difference is still

          9    there.  I think that is the flip side of

         10    smoothing.  It's hard to track why they are

         11    different.

         12              MS. KIRKENDALL:  And I think Jim's

         13    bias is to keep it simple because this simple

         14    regression model has been used for a long

         15    time.  He's done a good job.  And I still

         17    with the outliers and the influential but he

         18    doesn't like the idea of the automatic

         19    outlier detection because he thinks somebody

         20    ought to look at it.  He thinks a data person

         21    ought to make sure it's right.

          2    smoothly and is easy to use and easy to

          5    good idea and he likes using scatter plots.

          6    He likes the visual way of looking at data.

          7              DR. NEERCHAL:  I think, suppose you

          8    have enough manpower, looking at the outliers

          9    is definitely a good thing.  I don't think

         10    it's possible to tell some errors apart but

         11    if it's an obvious error or apparent shift I

         12    think really many times it could be difficult

         13    to distinguish, I think.

         14              So I think I'm partial to the idea

         15    that every time the model flags or something,

         16    look at it but I think doing things

         17    simultaneously with all the states is easily

         18    the right thing to do.  I think you'll have

         19    more to learn from that than doing them

         20    separately, definitely, so I want to just say

         21    that I definitely think that the one thing I

         20    just getting ready to publish, there is a lot

          1    price relationships and things like that.  So

          2    I would not do a national.  The states do

          3    differ significantly enough except when

          4    they're in neighborhoods.  So you can look in

          5    some senses to neighboring state trends but

          6    even then it's iffy.  So I would caution

          7    against trying to pull these things together

          8    because there is enough difference.

          9              DR. NEERCHAL:  But you don't have

         10    to fit the same coefficients for all the

         11    states.  I mean, you do it as a system I'm

         12    asking you, you can build the flexibility of

         13    different coefficients, perhaps, but do them

         14    simultaneously, borrow the data from each

         15    other?

         18    there are statistically significant

         19    differences between the states, I think, in

         20    both trends and then --

         21              DR. BURTON:  I think what he's

         22    saying is that you may have consumption here

          6              MR. BERNSTEIN:  But actually there

          7    are not enough.  There are enough differences

          8    in both trends and relationships between

          9    states significant enough in some fuels and

         10    not other fuels.  Electricity is significant,

         11    gas is not, residential is more significant

         12    than commercial, but it really changes.  I

         13    mean, what we found in this latest work is it

         14    really changes from state to state and fuel

         15    to fuel.  And so you can't you can't do the

         16    same thing for residential electricity that

          2    I mean, I know this was yesterday's

          3    discussion but that continues to bug me.  It

          4    shouldn't be there.  For sure that wasn't

          5    real, that couldn't happen, it's impossible.

          6    Well, it's not impossible, I suppose, but

          7    highly unlikely and it should not persist in

          5    background because you weren't here

          6    yesterday.  Yesterday we weren't talking

          7    about electric power data.  We were talking

          8    about other data anomalies in the EIA.  And

          9    the committee said that they wanted to see

         10    flags when we saw something that was odd.

         11    Whether we knew what the answer was or not

         12    they'd like have users be alerted to when

         13    there are funny things in the data.  And, of

         14    course, you guys have data back to 1990s.

         15    Rather than have to keep correcting them I'd

         16    like to say that the 1990 data are fair

         17    ———————— and we don't need to mess with them

         18    any more but there are some funny things in

         19    the old data.

         20              So the research questions about

         21    putting flags on, how do you put flags on?

          2    know what the answer is and you could fix it

          3    if only you had the time and resources.  And

          4    sometimes you might not know what the reason

          5    is.  I'm not asking you a question.  This is

          6    putting it in context because it's something

          7    that the committee has brought up.

          8              MR. BERNSTEIN:  But we did not say

          9    yes, that you had to fix every problem.

         10              MS. KIRKENDALL:  No.

         11              MR. BERNSTEIN:  You just need to

         12    make sure the user knew that you thought

         13    there was a problem.

         18    on it, it's too far in the past, but the fact

         19    is you just got to let the user know.  That's

          5    particular data point that you know is

          6    questionable you can put a comment there on

          7    that particular data point in the spreadsheet

          8    or somewhere else in the spreadsheet.  I

          9    mean, there are different ways to do it.  I'm

         10    generally not the user.  It's one of my

         11    assistants who's the user.  So I could sit

         12    down and ask them what's the best way for

          5    outlier or what constitutes a problem is

          6    something very specific to the context in

         18              MR. BERNSTEIN:  But only if you're

         19    actually plotting it.  If you're taking the

         20    data and assuming it's okay and you're doing

          1    down we don't look to see that every number

          2    is okay.  We assume it's okay and therefor

          3    start doing regressions on it.  And the only

          4    way we uncovered these is because we actually

          5    started disaggregating the data to look at

          6    things in a more disaggregated way and

          7    noticed that six out of the 48 states we were

          8    looking at had some weird things in it.  We

          9    wouldn't have seen it if we were doing the

         10    national --

         11              MR. RUTHERFORD:  But the thing is

         12    that there are so many different ways to

         13    slice it and then once you visualize it the

         14    right way then you can see the problem.

         15              MR. BERNSTEIN:  There are obvious

         16    ones and there are not obvious ones and

         17    they're not going to be able to flag

         18    everything but the obvious ones when they see

         19    them and they know.  And also, I mean,

         20    statistically you can figure this out as

         21    you're pulling data in.

          2    excellent presentation.  I go back to what is

          3    it we're trying to do and ask myself how does

          4    this serve the basic product and it seems to

          5    me that what you're trying to do is improve

          6    the quality of the data that you report.  And

          7    so it sounds like you're doing the right

          8    thing, which is using these approaches to

          9    flag stuff that you want to go back and ask

         10    questions about, go back and say are we

         11    actually getting reported what we intended to

         12    get reported.

         13              There's an implication that you

         14    there's another thing you might be doing and

         15    I think are doing all the time which is

         16    inferring the values for nonrespondents which

         17    you've got to do if you're trying to make an

         18    estimate of the universe.  There is a third

         19    thing you might be doing which flows over

         20    into the STEO.  Are you drifting toward

         21    replacing primary data with your model

         22    output?  That troubles me a bit.

          3              DR. EDMONDS:  The data sets will

          4    all look great and every once in a while

          5    you'll find that you'll get a data set and

          6    you'll actually put together a little model

          7    you'll stumble across I got a perfect fit.

          8    This is really good.  But it may be too good

          9    to be true and then you find, of course,

         10    those weren't really primary data.  So I

         11    think, given that your principle product is

         12    the data and that the models are in service

         13    of getting the best primary data, I just

         14    caution, be careful about drifting over into

         15    that other piece of business.  It's important

         16    to infer for nonrespondents but don't let

         17    just a model override and overwrite the

         18    primary data because it's really the primary

         19    data which is your product and in hindsight

         20    it may well turn out that this thing actually

         21    did happen when you go back and investigate

         22    it and there is real important information

          4    damages based on flood characteristics.  And

          5    so we took all these damage estimates from

          6    flood events and started regressing them

          7    against the flows and other flood

          8    characteristics and the model fit was

          9    absolutely pristine and I looked and said

         10    this is great.  Look how good this is.  Turns

         11    out once we started showing this to the Corps

         12    of Engineers they said well, we didn't really

         13    actually have specific estimates.  We just

         14    used the flood characteristics.  No wonder my

         13              MR. SCHNAPP:  I've been taking down

         14    some notes as I had been hearing this.  Let

         15    me give you a little bit of background.  I'm

         16    not sure if it explains any of these data

         17    anomalies but let's see.  In 2002 the form

         18    was changed so that we could collect

         19    information from energy service providers.

         20    I'm not just talking about Oklahoma here but

         21    I'm just talking about in general.

         22              Before that it was easy.  We would

          1    send the form to electric utilities.  They

          2    would tell us who all their customers were,

          3    what their revenues, what their sales were.

          4    That was easy but when the states deregulated

          5    then we had to start collecting information

          6    from energy service providers.  Well, they

          7    only give you information about what their

          8    customers and their revenues are.  So now you

          9    have to pick up the other piece of the

         10    revenue from the distributors.

         11              So theoretically inside of a state

         12    those numbers should match.  The number of

         13    customers should match and the sales should

         14    match as well, the sales versus the amount of

         15    electricity that you're transporting there

         16    for them, and what we found is that they

         17    don't.

         18              And so the 2001 data actually did

         19    reconcile that data.  We worked with Nancy's

         20    group to reconcile that.  That wasn't done in

         21    2002 or 2003.  It was done this year for

         22    2004.  And this year Tom Leckey has actually

          1    gone back and revised it for 2002 and 2003 so

          2    that they are consistent and so we'll be

          3    putting out a revised historical Excel

          4    spreadsheet hopefully inside of next month or

          5    so here.

          6              Another large change that happened

          7    was in 2003.  There was a residential,

          8    commercial, industrial sectors and then there

          9    was another sector called other.  And most of

         10    the stuff that went into other was things

         11    like public street lighting and irrigation

         12    and transportation.  And we did away with

         13    that category and we created the

         14    transportation category so that our

         15    information could be consistent with the rest

         16    of EIA's data.

         17              And we asked them to take whatever

         18    they're reporting that should have been in

         19    the commercial or the industrial sector and

         20    move it there moving forward.  And so we did

         21    that with the 2003 data for the first time

         22    and that was fairly good data.  I would say

          1    the 2004 data has gotten better but what you

          2    see is then it couldn't explain some of the

          3    shocks that you see there, either things

          4    moving in or moving out.  You need to add

          5    together the commercial, the industrial, and

          6    transportation in order to see what's

          7    happening there.

          8              You also have about two years ago

          9    the acting administrator asked us to look at

         10    the sales data to see what was going on

         11    because there seemed to be something funny

         12    between the commercial and the industrial

         13    sectors.  Having made lots and lots of phone

         14    calls, what we found out was that there was a

         15    number of different things going on.  You

         16    have companies that merge and so the prior

         17    companies categorize certain customers, for

         18    example, as industrial because they give them

         19    a real low rate but they're really commercial

         20    customers which they categorize as

         21    industrial.

          5    revenue going in that direction.  And it

         12    anywhere in the data?

         13              MR. SCHNAPP:  Well, I mean, the

         14    movements are fairly subtle.  I mean, they're

         15    there but to explain every movement of a

         16    couple of percent is difficult.

         17              MR. BERNSTEIN:  It's not really a

         18    shock.  A shock means something that's going

         19    to significantly change the analysis you're

         20    doing.  So, I mean, there are subtle changes.

         21    That's fine.

          1    they were talking about because like a

          2    percent or two here was throwing off the STEO

          3    model.  And so they wanted to know what was

          4    going on there.  We also have a case where a

          5    company starts to build a mall, for example,

          6    and all the electricity being sold to that

          7    company is categorized as industrial because

          8    an industrial facility is building this mall.

          9    The question is after they're finished does

         10    that become a commercial sale or they leave

         11    as industrials and they do both.

         12              So we can't control them as to who

         13    they're classifying as what.  We give them

         14    our definitions and we can't sit there and

         15    hold their hand with every single customer

         16    that they have to figure out where they go.

         19    talked to you a couple of times about our

         20    Internet data collection system.  And what

          5    you've got an error here.  You need to fix

          6    this before you submit it.

          7              They are allowed to submit it if

          8    they override it and explain why.  And then

          9    we look at that explanation and see if it's

         10    reasonable and either accept that or we call

         11    them back.  So our Internet data collection

         12    system right now for all of our forms we

         13    collect about 36-37,000 forms during the

         14    year.  About 88 percent of them came in on

         15    the Internet this year.

         16              And as far as the 826 is concerned

         17    it's probably closer to 95 percent came in on

         18    the Internet.  So most of that already is

         19    clean and there are about 450 respondents on

         20    the 826 out of 3,000-ish that's on the 861.

         21    Those 450 account for somewhere between 85

         22    and 90 percent of electricity sales.

          4    looking at the national number, I mean, the

         10    Particularly on the 826 and the 861 they

         11    really do keep perfecting them on the edit

         12    side.

         13              And we're also, frankly, actually

         14    very excited about the scatter plots, which

         15    still could show us outliers, and the way

         16    they put it together, you see an outlier, you

         17    click on that dot, and it gives you all the

          7    one.  It's the one I think everybody thinks

          8    is in terms of predicting or is the current

          9    estimate the correct one.  And if you look at

         10    the models that we've used you use the past

         11    data and you're trying to figure out is this

         12    observation valid, do I make an imputation,

         13    is it an outlier.

         14              And then there's the other question

         15    that we've talked about yesterday which is

         16    data quality.  And data quality sometimes

         17    cannot be made on the fly.  Sometimes 20/20

         18    hindsight is a useful thing, especially for

         19    data quality.  That's how sometimes we find

         20    those errors that, you know what, that thing

         21    just didn't look good in hindsight.  And so

         22    when you're going to do the data quality

          1    you're allowed to use both past and future

          2    observations and that can change.

          3              So, for example, if you have a

          4    change in level if you look at this and oh,

          5    yes, there's a change in level, that doesn't

          6    seem like an outlier.  It's a break, it's

          7    something that happened, but it's not an

          8    outlier.  And so really thinking of what use

          9    you want to do will influence what kind of

         10    data you're using and how you're using.  And

         11    for data quality you're allowed to use future

         12    observations to predict the past.  At least

         13    morally I would feel satisfied if you would

         14    do that.

         15              So I know it's a small detail,

         16    maybe, but I think it's something to keep in

         17    mind of what use you want to do with the data

         18    because it influences your model and what

         19    you're going to do with it.  There are still

         20    time series but sometimes the way you're

         21    going to use the data is different.  So that

         22    was my comment and I think it goes along a

          3    running over time, I think.

          4              DR. HENGARTEN:  You already had

          5    your turn.

          6              DR. NEERCHAL:  I just wanted to

          7    mention I think the NHTSA people have a data

          8    set on accidents.  They have a column there

          9    on blood alcohol content and this is a

         10    notoriously difficult number to get because

         11    many people refuse to take the test and

         12    sometimes they forget because it's such an

         13    emergency that they don't have time to give

         14    this test.  And so this is one of the

         15    spottiest columns in that vehicle accidents

         16    data in NHTSA.

         17              And they have done imputation and I

         18    think that Jae's comment reminded me so they

         19    still make the original data available.  So

         20    it's not imputed data only and since you

         21    already know people in NHTSA they will be

         22    able to give you more details on it.  And I

          1    think in terms of how they handle the

          2    publication of it it's a good example.

          3              DR. HENGARTEN:  Well, thank you,

          4    everybody, for this lively discussion.  I'd

          5    like to invite the committee to split in two.

          6    We have break-out session.

          7              MR. COLE:  One quick question or

          8    comment, would it be possible to include a

          9    small sample of below cut-off firms in a

         10    monthly survey?  These cases right now are

         11    being imputed based upon a Russian model.  Or

         12    as an alternative would it be possible to

         13    develop two models, one for nonresponse for

         14    the larger firms and one for nonsample cases

         15    based upon the smaller observations in the

         16    sample?

         17              MS. KIRKENDALL:  They don't have

         18    very much nonresponse on this survey but it's

         19    nice to have an automatic imputation method.

         20    I mean, in fact usually they don't have any

         21    nonresponse or if they do it's on the really

         22    small ones.

          1              MR. COLE:  Would it be possible to

          2    build a model for nonsample cases based upon

          3    the smaller units in the sample?  Small firms

          4    are different from big firms and they have

          5    different behaviors and they may in fact have

          6    a different pattern.  That's all.

          7              MS. KIRKENDALL:  The initial survey

          8    design for this did have a probability sample

          9    and the problem with the small firms is they

         10    don't like to report to us and when they do

         11    report to us they report bad data.

         12              DR. HENGARTEN:  Any more questions?

          6    and talking to you.  I'm here today to talk a

          8              I think most of you were here in

         10    the first three surveys that we did a frame

         11    evaluation on.  This is actually the

         12    conclusion of the project today.  A little

         13    overview of what we're going to talk about

         14    today, first of all I'm going to talk to you

         15    a little bit about background and some of the

         16    purposes of the frame evaluations, give a

         17    little bit of summary on the final two

         18    surveys that we evaluated, talk to you a

         19    little bit about the generalized two-step

         20    matching process that we went through to

         21    match establishments on both survey frames.

          1    present some of the results.  She's going to

          2    talk to you a little bit about some of the

          3    implications of the frame structure and how

          4    we dealt with that.  Then she's going to give

          5    you the results of both by coverage, by

          6    establishment counts.  She's going to talk to

          7    you a little bit about coverage by volume and

          8    then we'll give a summary of what we found on

          9    these two surveys.

         10              Then I'll come back up and talk to

         11    you a little bit about some general

         12    conclusions from the project as a whole, talk

         13    a little bit about the next steps for EIA off

         14    of these results, and then we have a question

         15    for the committee that we'd like to end with,

         18              The purpose of the frames

         20    coverage of the EIA frames, we wanted to

         21    identify differences between the frames, and

          4              The final two evaluations that

          5    we're going to be talking about today, both

          6    evaluations were conducted using the 2002

          7    survey frames.  The first one was the EIA-3,

          8    which is the quarterly coal consumption and

          9    quality report for manufacturing plants.

         10    This survey collects data on coal consumption

         11    within the manufacturing sector of the United

         12    States.

         13              The second evaluation that we

         14    conducted was actually a EIA frame subset of

         15    two EIA surveys.  The first survey was the

         16    EIA-860.  This is the annual electric

         17    generator report.  This survey collects

         18    information about generators from electric

         19    power producers.  The EIA-906 is the monthly

         20    power point report and this survey collects

         21    operational information about fuel

         22    consumption and electricity generation from

          4    what we called the combined heat and power

          5    plants frame.  The analysis that we're going

          6    to talk about will evaluate the coverage of

          7    these plants and most of them are in the

          8    manufacturing sector.  The EIA-860 had over

          9    5700 establishments of which 562 were non-

         10    regulated and on the 906 frame in 2002.

         11              The nonregulated portion of the

         12    electric power industry consists of these

         13    combined heat and power plants and

         14    independent power producers.  The analysis

         15    will focus on the 645 combined heat and power

         16    plants or what we'll call the CHPs that were

         17    self-classified on EIA's frame within the

          1    we have at the Census.  The first step was to

          2    match reporting units to our business

          3    register and we needed to do this to

          4    determine if there were manufacturing details

          5    available in what we call the back end

          6    dataset.  Now, the business register is the

          7    universe of establishments that the Census

          8    Bureau uses.  It's a large data set and it

          9    contains classification information where

         10    establishments are classified based on

         11    primary activity at the plant or at the

         12    facility that's being considered.

         13              So only the establishments that we

         14    were able to match to manufacturing in this

         15    step of the matching process are included in

         16    the results that you'll see when Vicki comes

         17    up to talk to you.  And, as I just stated,

         18    getting ahead of myself a little bit, the

         19    second step was then to take these

         20    manufacturing establishments and match them

         21    to establishments that were on the 2002

         22    manufacturing energy consumption survey.

          1              The manufacturing energy

          2    consumption survey is a sample survey based

          3    on the economic census.  The reason we used

          4    this survey in this time, if you remember in

          5    the spring we did the analysis with the 2002

          6    economic census.  The data was better for

          7    this type of analysis on the MECS.  We have

          8    more detail for electricity consumption and

          9    production and we also have more detail on

         10    coal consumption.

         11              For the economic census we did not

         12    have a specific piece of data for coal

         13    consumption that we could match to.  Coal

         14    consumption in the economic census is

         15    considered a cost of fuels and we had no way

         16    to break out what portion of that fuel was

         17    spent on coal and what portion, for example,

         18    would be spent on natural gas and other fuels

         19    used at the establishment.  So we matched to

         20    the manufacturing energy consumption survey

         21    and that's the data that will be used in the

         22    results.

          1              Vicki's going to come up and talk

          2    to you a little bit now about what she found

          3    when she did the analysis and present some of

          4    the results, all of the results, actually.

          5              MS. HAITOT:  Good morning.  The

          6    coal consumption survey frame has

          7    manufacturing establishments as the target

          8    population of the survey.  We used a matching

          9    program which we created it from Stacy's

         10    office to match the companies on EIA-3 by

         11    name with establishments in the business

         12    register.  And then we had to look at those

         13    to make sure that they were accurately

         14    matched.  The matching program had a higher

         15    percentage of one to one matches.

         16              There is a threshold of 1,000 short

         17    tons of coal consumed annually which was

         18    easily implemented in this survey.  There are

         19    28 establishments on MECS that consume this

         20    and so we took them out of the analysis.  For

         21    the CHP frame, which was the subset of the

         22    annual electric generator frame, and the

          1    monthly power plant report we had to match

          2    establishments a different way because the

          3    program had a very small percentage of

          4    matches.

          5              The manufacturing establishments

          6    were a very small percentage of the target

          7    population for this survey and this survey

          8    had a threshold of 1-megawatt capacity.  So

          9    there was no generic relationship between

         10    capacity and generation which the MECS has on

         11    their form.  So we took the two files and we

         12    wanted to see what level of generation would

         13    be equivalent to the megawatt capacity of the

         14    generators so where the matching on the MECS

         15    became less frequent with EIA's

         16    establishments we determined was the

         17    threshold for MECS which was around 2,000

         18    megawatt hours, so we took everybody that was

         19    generating less than 2,000 megawatts off the

         20    MECS for the comparison.

         21              There was a little bit of confusion

         22    matching plants of the EIA-60 because of the

          1    way that they classified their

          2    establishments.  The MECS is concerned with

          3    the activities of the facility level so our

          4    frame is based on which facilities.  Well,

          5    EIA is concerned with activities going on in

          6    the generator stage so they're concerned with

          7    what's happening at each generator.

          8              Well, it turned out that some of

          9    the generators could be owned by more than

         10    one company and they might not even be

         11    manufacturing.  Like, company 1 could be a

         12    utility while company 2 could be

         13    manufacturing and so it would be hard to

         14    figure out which one actually was at the

         15    facility or owned the facility so it made

         16    matching a little more difficult and it may

         17    result in some false nonmatches.

         18              So the coverage by establishment

         19    count for the coal consumption survey, we

         20    used a ratio of 355 matched out of 452 total

         21    establishments in the sample for the 2002

         22    MECS.  We initially found 37 establishments

          1    on EIA's frame not in manufacturing.  There

          2    were 23 in mining, four in utility, four were

          3    in government, four were in some other

          4    sector, and three we were unable to match.

          5    So that accounted for 14 percent of EIA's

          6    consumption, very small, so they're missing

          7    eight establishments off the MECS survey in

          8    Kentucky, seven in Ohio, and six each in

          9    Georgia, Michigan, and South Carolina.

         10              The 30 percent of the missing

         11    establishments off of MECS were classified in

         12    NAICS-327, which is nonmetallic mineral

         13    products.  For the CHP frame we've matched

         14    410 out of 588 establishments for a 70

         15    percent coverage rate.  It was the same

         16    ratio.

         17              The combined heat and power plant

         18    frame consisted of 645 establishments in

         19    manufacturing so there were 27 not in

         20    manufacturing, seven in utilities, three were

         21    in government, and 17 we were unable to match

         22    which could be that double ownership

          2              We excluded the unmatched plants

          3    that generated less than 2,000 megawatt hours

          4    from the MECS frame based on our threshold

          5    comparison so EIA's frame is missing 23

          6    establishments in California, 15 in Michigan,

          7    14 in Texas, and 32 percent of the missing

          9    which is paper manufacturing.

         10              For the coverage by volume the coal

         11    consumption survey had a coverage rate of .89

         12    which was measured as a ratio of coal

         13    consumption.  This ratio for volume only uses

         14    MECS data.  It tells us how much of the MECS

         15    unweighted estimate is accounted for by

         16    establishments that matched EIA's frame, the

         17    matched establishment over total in-scope

         18    establishments, so the coverage for coal

         19    consumed for fuel use was .86 and the

         20    coverage for coal consumed for nonfuel use is

         21    .98.

         22              Now, fuel use is anything that

          1    would be used for heat, power, or electric

          2    generation.  Nonfuel use would be things for

          3    like, feed stocks or raw materials inputted

          4    into the manufacturing process.

          5              The coverage by volume for the

          6    electric generator survey had a coverage rate

          7    of .75 which was measured as the same ratio

          8    of electricity generation.  So our summary is

          9    that coal consumption had a coverage by

         10    establishment count of .79, a coverage by

         11    volume of .89 in short tons.  The electric

         12    generator survey had coverage by

         13    establishment count of .70 and a coverage by

         14    volume of .75 kilowatt hours.  And now Rick

         17              MR. HOUGH:  Like I said, these are

         19    itself, the contract was for five surveys.

         21    about some of the results in general from

          1              From the five surveys we found a

          2    range of coverage by establishment counts

          3    from .7 to .92.  We had a range of coverage

          4    by volume from .75 to 1.  The average

          5    difference between the count and volume rates

          6    was about 11 percent so the coverage by

          7    volume was on average 11 percent higher than

          8    the coverage by count.

          9              Looking at these numbers and

         10    through our evaluations of missing

         11    establishments, and when we had a missing

         12    establishment we did some research on them

         13    and verified that they were actually missing

         14    in the sense that they were consuming coal or

         15    they were in reality producing electricity

         16    and should have been on EIA's frame, from

         17    that analysis one of the conclusions we made,

         18    that the missing establishments were

         19    relatively small and in some instances would

         20    have little or no effect on the published

         21    estimate if they were to go out and try and

         22    get them.

          8    determine the appropriate procedures to

          9    implement if they want to go after some

         10    coverage improvements.

         11              And the one question we had is what

         12    level of coverage should be significant.  So

         13    from these conclusions do you think this is

         14    sufficient?

         15              MR. SINGPURWALLA:  It seems like if

         16    I look at the general conclusions for all

         17    five frames you got some higher hit rate for

         18    some of the other surveys.

         19              MS. FORSYTH:  These are some of the

         20    lowest, aren't they?

         21              MR. HOUGH:  Correct, the first

         22    three surveys were very small compared to

          1    these last two.  I think we had --

          2              MS. HAITOT:  They average between

          3    20 and 25 establishments.

          4              MR. HOUGH:  Correct, so they were

          5    small.  These last two were a lot larger and

          6    a computer program was actually used to match

          7    the last two.  We did the first three by

          8    hand.  So that is accurate.  The lower

          9    coverages would be more reflective of a

         10    larger sample size.

         11              MR. SINGPURWALLA:  Can you tell us

         12    how you did the computer program matching or

         13    is that --

         14              MR. HOUGH:  The computer program

         15    actually looked to match on name.

         16              MS. HAITOT:  It matched on name.

         17    First it matched like the first 10 characters

         18    of the name and then it did a little bit of

         19    programming stuff and it matched like on a

         20    number basis after the first couple digits, I

         21    think.

          1              MR. HOUGH:  It went from names to

          2    address.

          3              MS. HAITOT:  Well, no, it only did

          4    name and then what Ashley and I did is we

          5    looked at those that matched to that to see

          6    if they were the same address.

          7              MR. HOUGH:  Address, so the

          8    computer program kicked out results on name

          9    and then the analysts then went in and looked

         10    at addresses and other geographic information

         11    to verify that they were actually matches.

         12              MR. SINGPURWALLA:  Yes, I was

         13    thinking like, while doing there will be some

         14    fuzzy matches but it sounds like you guys are

         15    taking that into account if it is.

         16              MR. HOUGH:  Well, the one slide,

         17    that was the key in these last two is that

         18    the target population for the coal

         19    consumption survey was manufacturing

         20    establishments so the format of their frame

         21    was much more conducive to this type of

         22    analysis.  I mean, if you go back to the one

          1    diagram where we showed this, the 806, MECS

          2    is concerned with the facility.  So is the

          3    coal consumption survey.  So the format of

          4    their survey was much more conducive to do

          5    these types of matches and the program kicked

          6    out a lot of matches off of initial run when

          7    we did the coal consumption survey.  Now,

          8    when we got to the combination from the

          9    electric power plant surveys and we pulled

         10    out the CHP units this format caused a little

         11    bit of a heartache for us because that survey

         12    is concerned at this level.  So they may have

         13    three rows with the same company name or

         14    different company names, the same address

         15    because maybe Company 2 was the facility and

         16    then Company 1 was possibly another company

         17    that might have been off in utilities.  Go

         18    ahead, Vicki.

         19              MS. HAITOT:  And EIA's 860 frame,

         20    the names that they listed as their company

         21    names were sometimes just like a plant

         22    location so it would be like the city plant

          1    and it was harder to match that because it

          2    was not in that city.

          3              MR. HOUGH:  Right, their focus was

          4    on this level so where this generator was

          5    wasn't that important.  The coal consumption

          6    survey was focused on manufacturing plants so

          7    the actual location of the manufacturing

          8    plant was a piece of data that they needed.

          9    But for here as long as they could get the

         10    data about this generator they're not

         11    concerned if it comes from the facility or if

         12    it comes from Company 1 or 2 as long as they

          5    Through our research we have found that yes,

          6    they do get into the hands of accountants.

          7              MS. WAUGH:  The 860 frame, actually

          8    we send it to the operator and the operator

          9    may not be the owner so it's whoever is

         17              MR. BOSTIC:  Even to add to the

         18    complexity, if you look at the example with

         19    Generator B, Company 1 and 2, you could have

         20    where they create a joint venture between the

         21    two companies so that would also complicate

         22    the matching process.

          3    was an issue that created a lot more work.

          5    were a lot more than the 17.  There were 17

          6    that we were able to match.

          8              MS. WAUGH:  But this problem

          9    permeated the entire frame.

         10              MR. HOUGH:  Correct, there were 17

         11    CHPs that we could not match to the register.

         12              MS. HAITOT:  That self-classified

         13    themselves in manufacturing because if they

         14    self-classified themselves in utility we

         15    didn't look at them.

         17              MS. KIRKENDALL:  That is another

         18    source of difference on our forms.  The

         19    companies report the NAICS code instead of

         20    what is their main business and on the MECS

         21    or on the Census Bureau forms they classify

          5              DR. SITTER:  But I think the issue

          6    isn't whether it made your matching hard.

          7    The issue is does .7 realistically reflect

          8    the under-coverage.  I mean, what is your

          9    feeling?  Did this difficulty in matching

         10    impact your bottom line?

         11              MS. HAITOT:  It might a little

         12    because of the fact that Company 1 or 2 could

         13    be in utilities and if it was in utilities

         14    then I didn't match it and I had a couple out

         15    of those 17.  They were all on the same city

         16    but I didn't know because the plant name on

         17    EIA frame might not have been an actual

         18    company's name.  I didn't know which one of

         19    those they were saying was manufacturing and

         20    had a generator.

         21              MR. HOUGH:  But basically the .7 is

         22    the lowest it can be.  I mean, what we're

          5              MS. WAUGH:  I have another way to

          6    look at some data to answer that question.

          7    If you look at the paper on page 5 we've

          8    actually identified those that are by state,

          9    those that are on EIA and not on MECS, and

         10    those that are on MECS and not on EIA.  And

         11    if you look at this there are some states

         12    where, for example, Arkansas there are two on

         13    the MECS that are not on the EIA and there

         14    are zero on EIA that are not on MECS.  So

         15    clearly we're missing those two.  But if you

         16    go down the road, some of our larger states,

         17    I can't remember which you gave --

         18              MS. HAITOT:  There's one on there.

         19    I don't remember which state.  There are

         20    three missing on MECS and there are three

         21    missing on EIA.  They could be the same three

         22    but I just don't know because of the name.

          6    and the CHPs are something like 5 percent of

          7    the total generation and the rest of the

          8    generation is by utilities or IPPs.

          9              MR. HOUGH:  Right, I mean, the

         11    percentage of their target population so the

         14              MS. KIRKENDALL:  But actually one

         15    of the reasons we were very interested in

         16    those matches is that we thought what if we

         17    would like to use this frame for some other

         18    purpose, and we wanted to know what are its

         19    attributes before we would decide to do that.

         20              MR. HOUGH:  If you wanted to

         21    publish some data on the CHPs individually,

         22    for example.

          1              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Right, if we

          2    wanted another survey or something we wanted

          3    to target the electric generators or

          4    manufacturers this might be a handy frame to

          5    have.  And so then the question is is this

          6    kind of coverage good enough for whatever

          7    purpose we have for that.  We might think it

          8    might be all right in terms of the coverage

          9    of the overall electric power sector because

         10    it's such a small piece of it although

         11    they've given us information to know where to

         12    look we've got NAICS codes, which ought to

         13    make it easier to pick up some of them.

         14              MR. HOUGH:  Correct.

         15              MS. KIRKENDALL:  With that kind of

         16    information we might be able to do something

         17    that isn't too difficult that would improve

         18    the frame.  And then states helps to narrow

         19    it down, come up with the states for ——————

          2    something else.

          3              MS. HAITOT:  And we provided on

          4    this frame in the paper a NAICS by state of

          5    the missing establishments so they know which

          6    NAICS in each state they need to focus on.

          8    information that we could do something.

          9              MR. SINGPURWALLA:  Do you ever look

         10    at the coverage evaluation over time or is

         11    this the first time that you've done it?

         12              MS. KIRKENDALL:  This is the first

         14    the Census Bureau and they're the only folks

         19    whole lot about this but like, frame shifting

          1    you brought up yesterday that we had some

          2    under coverage because we didn't have the

          3    blenders in petroleum.

          4              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Well, I mean, in

          5    fact these CHPs, 15 years ago we weren't

          6    interested in CHPs because we didn't consider

          7    the electric generation.  They were doing it,

          8    just we didn't think that was part of what we

          9    should look at.  But then there were some

         10    laws passed that encouraged more electric

         11    generation or special provisions that made it

         12    more lucrative to do that and so it's been

         13    encouraged and that's when we started

         14    surveying it.

         15              MR. HOUGH:  And those laws are

         16    continuing to be passed at the state level.

         17    The states are giving more incentive for

         18    manufacturing establishments to co-generate.

         19              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes, right, and

         20    the other thing we found out when we talked

         21    to the people in the Electric Power Division

         22    was that in either 2002 or 2003 they had done

          3    it to see if they added companies after that.

          4    So we need to see has the frame expanded

          5    since 2002.  Maybe we picked up some of them.

          6    We probably didn't pick up all of them.  That

          7    would be asking too much.  But at least we

          8    might get a feel for that by looking at the

         15    thing that we should think about particularly

         16    with the electric power form is maybe we need

         17    to try to be more careful with the names of

         18    companies because that was the big problem

         19    they had.  They couldn't identify the

          3              MR. HOUGH:  Right, but then they

          4    had a multitude of information on the

          5    generator, what type of fuel it used, I mean,

          6    what its output was, and that's all goes to

          7    the purpose of the survey and the coal

          8    survey, like I said, the target population,

          9    it was a lot easier because their target

         10    population was manufacturing plants.

         11              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I think the coal

          4    list of respondents against a list that you

          5    have at the Census Bureau and I'm just

          6    wondering in terms of having a better way to

          8    would be valuable for us to consider if it's

          9    legally possible adding the EIN as a piece of

         10    information that we would ask our respondents

         11    to report to us.

         12              MR. HOUGH:  It would make our job

         13    easier but I'll defer to Bill or Stacy.  I

         14    mean, could they ask establishments to

         16              MR. BOSTIC:  Part of the issue

         17    would be where are the legalities of looking

         18    at data from EIA and passing it on to the

         19    Census Bureau.  That could be considered more

         20    or less a data sharing type exercise but I'm

         21    not sure.  You would have to probably check.

          1    could do is to say something like it would be

          2    voluntary reporting but the only use of this

          4    for matching of frames or for frames

          5    evaluation purposes.  So that would be okay

          6    in terms of ———————— or because we'd be

          7    telling the respondent exactly what we're

          8    going to do with it.  So you could do

          9    something like that.  I don't know whether

          2    would find out in the Federal Register.

          3              MR. BOSTIC:  I mean, you have to

          4    take into consideration there is a

          5    perception, I think, out there that

          6    government agencies share data anyhow.

          9    The one thing that you might want to consider

         10    as part of the evaluation is to go outside of

         11    the manufacturing sector because, as I

         12    understand from some of the previous other

         13    evaluations, I think there were some

         14    wholesale cases.

         15              So you can see is there a coverage

         18    utilities and we collect information on

         19    utilities in the year of the economic census.

         20    So part of what you might want to consider

         21    and take into account, do you want to expand

          1    manufacturing sector to see if you have some

          2    coverage issues in some of the other sectors

          3    that are in the frame.

          4              MS. KIRKENDALL:  We ought to chat

          5    with you about where we could do something, I

          6    mean, because part of the reason why we

          7    didn't, we know about MECS and we know you

          8    have a good frame for the manufacturers.  So

          9    these were the target of opportunity that we

         10    have these areas where we could do this.  But

         11    it would be interesting to know where else we

         12    could do evaluations.

         13              MR. WATSON:  The second point here,

         14    again related to the coal consumption results

         15    and the coverage by volume of .89, put that

         16    in a little bit of perspective.  Roughly the

         17    volume of coal in the manufacturing sector is

         18    almost 200 million tons a year now and

         19    there's something peculiar going on here.

          1    Congress may extend that.  So when this was

          2    done I think the volume of coal wasn't quite

          3    up to the number that I mentioned here today

          4    but it's possibly around 160 million.

          5              The point here, though, is 10

          6    percent of that is roughly 15 to 20 million

          7    tons a year that possibly were missing and

          8    then for the entire US most of the coal, of

          9    course, goes to electric generation and we

         10    would have to factor in the missing coal

         11    there too but this is a very small amount of

         12    coal.  It's 15 to 20 million tons out of

         13    about 1.1 billion.

         14              In terms of its importance to

         15    manufacturing, though, it's not trivial.  I

         16    mean, I actually don't like to see these

         17    results.  I don't think people that I work

         18    for like to see them.  So we are concerned

         19    about trying to fill in the gaps here even

         20    though at a certain level this looks like a

         21    small amount of coal.  But I think in the

         22    scheme of things we drive ourselves crazy

          9    place we can go to try to figure out who out

         10    there might be burning coal that we don't

         11    know about.  Yesterday somebody voluntarily

         12    sent us an e-mail from a firm, a new employee

         13    in the firm General Shale Brick, and they use

         14    a lot of coal to make brick, and they in our

         15    frame currently have seven sites that this

         16    person was reporting for.  He said, by the

         17    way, I'm a new employee and I notice that we

         18    have four other facilities that are not on

         19    your list.  How come?  So, of course, we

         20    followed up right away.

         21              MR. BOSTIC:  Is he still a new

          1              MR. WATSON:  In any event it's

          2    really difficult to find these and I think

          3    there was an exercise roughly five years ago,

          4    maybe even longer than that.  Actually it's

          5    about 10 years ago, sorry, where there was an

          6    attempt to look at all of the pollution

          7    discharge records from individual states

          8    because all of these little tiny coal fire

          9    boilers are regulated under the state ——————

         10    plan regulations for pollution control.  But

         11    what you get is you get a database in the

         12    State of Ohio, for example, that might have

         13    500,000 records in it and you're culling

         14    through that and you've got most of everybody

         15    in Ohio so it's not that you're looking for

         16    obvious things.  You're looking for things

         17    that are difficult to find.

         18              So you're culling through that

         19    trying to figure out who could be burning

         20    coal out of all of the pollution discharge

         21    stuff that they report and then you have this

         22    other problem of did they accurately report

          5    and could be a very costly thing to do to try

          6    to fill in the gap here so I'm really

          8    way that doesn't really require enormous

          9    resource because the exercise 10 years ago,

         10    and I'm only talking from conversations that

         11    I've had with people on my team about it,

         12    evidently engaged the work of people working

         13    almost a year, four or five people full-time,

         18    that we had talked about when we met with you

         19    folks was that you can use the NAIC-3 by

         20    state and possibly make some contacts with

         21    some trade associations and see if they will

          3    you.

          4              We use trade associations quite a

          5    bit as contacts to talk to them and ask them

          6    to give us information about the members that

          7    they have.  And I agree.  I mean, as a

          8    manager this does come down to a cost-benefit

          9    type scenario where you have to put in one

         10    hand, sure, .89 makes you a little bit

         11    nervous but then, like you said, the benefit

         12    to pull that up to .92, what's that going to

         13    cost you?

         14              Well, if you have to take three or

         16    year it just might not be worth that type of

         17    expenditure.  So I agree with you and that's

         18    why we provided as much information as we

         19    could under Title 13 to point you in the

         20    right direction and we'd be willing to come

         21    over and talk even more about some of the

          5    mean, those syn fuel plants, you've got them.

          6    I mean, the coal that's being consumed as

          7    material inputs, those guys are reporting to

          8    you and from what I understand they'll put

          9    their numbers out on billboards so they get

         10    their tax breaks.  But anyway it looks like

         11    where you might be missing are the

         12    establishments that are beginning to take

          5    something but we somehow assume that our

          6    universe is covered by at least the Census

          7    frame or by the EIA.  Is it possible that

          8    there's quite a sizable subgroup of the

          9    universe that's not caught at all?  Is there

         10    a way to estimate how it impacts the mean

         11    square error of the estimates that EIA is

         12    putting out?

         13              Your question to the committee was

         14    what coverage is enough and I think the

         15    answer is partially dependant on how does it

         16    impact the estimates that EIA is putting out

         17    and is there any way we can know what the

         19    the estimates?

         20              MS. KIRKENDALL:  We think the

          8    that the nonmatches are really nonmatches.

          9              DR. FEDER:  Because frames are time

         10    dependent, enterprises are generated, they

         11    change their composition, they move, so we

         12    know that there's no way whatever Census has

          5    perfection.

          6              DR. FEDER:  So you improve your

          7    estimate in coverage but can you improve also

          8    your estimates of your under-coverage because

          9    sometimes even looking back and saying all

         10    right because I know actually from Canadian

         11    experience where the counterparts of the IRS

         12    provided us data and I know there's the

         13    filing process and you always file for

         14    previous years and so on.

         15              So what you can do is looking back,

         16    let's say, in 2007 you can estimate how good

         17    your 2005 estimates were and make an

         18    adjustment, have an under-coverage rate for

         19    the census frame.  Sometimes perfect coverage

         20    is not as good as knowing how much under-

         21    coverage there is in the same way that

         22    sometimes census, and I'm saying it to a

          1    Census Bureau person, is not as good as a

          2    good survey because a survey could be

          3    unbiased and in addition it comes with a

          4    measure of uncertainty in terms of mean

          5    square errors, standard errors, and biases.

          6    So I know what I'm saying here is quite

          7    onerous.  Maybe it's not feasible.  You

          8    talked about cost-benefit issue.  I'm just

          9    saying that assuming that the census frame is

         10    perfect is --

         11              MR. HOUGH:  Well, no, you have to

         12    realize for the coal the frame that we were

         13    comparing to was reported establishments that

         14    told us they were consuming coal.  Now, when

         15    we published MECS the only real mechanism we

         16    had to identify under-coverage for coal

         17    consumption would be to compare to historic

         18    information or look to some other piece of

         19    information that we could possibly get some

         20    evidence that the establishment actually was

         21    consuming coal.

          1    users it's easier because there are some

          2    products like coke, for example, that you

          3    just can't produce without coal.  So there

          4    are some methodologies that we use and

          5    implement it to prevent the under-coverage

          6    but if we have an establishment that is

          7    actually consuming coal and historically

          8    reports to us that they're not it's very

          9    difficult to have that mechanism identifying

         10    that they're actually under coverage in the

         11    coal consumption area.

         12              MR. WATSON:  This doesn't speak to

         13    this particular issue but in the coal area

         14    EIA has data both on the supply and demand

         15    side.  So we routinely in our quarterly

         16    reports have a balance for the entire US

         17    where we look at everything that's coming in

         18    on the production side, everything that's on

         19    the supply side, everything that's consumed

         20    or on the demand side.  We're also looking at

         21    stocks so we have stock change.

          1    accurate and perfect data, you have no

          2    discrepancy between what's supplied and

          3    what's demanded accounting for stock change.

          4    This also has to take into account, of

          5    course, exports and imports, the entire flow

          6    of energy both on the supply side and demand

          7    side, and typically what we find is we're

          8    about plus or minus something like five

          9    million tons, again out of a 1.1 billion

         10    total, and the pattern of that thing is plus

         11    and negative.

         12              It looks pretty random.  We never

         13    actually did a statistical test to determine

         14    whether it's random but it's reassuring.  It

         15    doesn't necessarily say, though, that you're

         16    doing a good job in each particular area

          1    might be missing 15 million tons here on this

          4    calculation way off the zero line and it

          6    I don't know whether it's going to be plus or

          9              DR. SITTER:  But couldn't it be a

         10    misclassification issue more than an under-

         11    coverage issue then?  I mean, there are mis-

         12    definitions going all over the place here as

         13    to which categories these things fall into

         14    and overall you may be catching everybody.

         15    You're just not classifying them that well.

         16    When I say not well I mean still pretty good,

         17    I mean, but some of this could be mis-

         19    of what kind of energy usage they're making.

         20    It's pretty complicated.

          5    has a generator and it's hooked to the grid,

          6    those firms are supposed to be both in the

          7    electric sector surveys as well as on our

          8    manufacturing surveys and we try very hard

          9    not to double count.  So we do a comparison

         10    there so we won't double count.  And then the

         13              DR. SITTER:  What I mean is that

          4    in time there was some explanation as to why

          5    those companies were included before you

          6    came, Bill.

          7              MR. WATSON:  Well, even while I've

          8    been here.  We should look into that because

          9    that should not be there if that's the case.

         10    We do depend upon the companies initially to

         11    tell us whether they are in the manufacturing

         12    sector and so we may not have looked very

         13    carefully at what they do relative to their

         14    information about what they think they do so

         15    we need to come back and revisit that.

         18    primary activity.  That does not necessarily

         19    mean there is no manufacturing capability at

         20    the establishment.  It just means that its

          1    cases where it's difficult.  For example,

          2    there are those munitions plans out there in

          3    Illinois that are run by private companies

          4    under government contract and there may be an

          5    issue about is that a government activity or

          6    is that a commercial activity.  And in that

         19    United States and it's outsourced abroad or

         20    to another company.  A lot of these companies

          6    itself.

          7              A lot of things in the economy

         10    happening faster than we can keep up with

         11    which is becoming a challenge.  So basically

         12    you're talking about snapshots at a point in

         13    time and there will be times where we'll miss

         14    pieces.

         15              I mean, in conducting our surveys

         16    on an annual basis typically we always are

         17    having revisions from the next year because

         18    of new data we are capturing or they reported

         19    incorrectly given some product that they

         20    produce which we'll now move into another

         21    industry.  By the time we finish issuing 473

          2              DR. HENGARTEN:  Thank you very

          3    much.  Before we proceed can I ask the

          4    committee members to come here very fast for

          5    a group photo?

          7              DR. HENGARTEN:  Welcome back.  I'll

          8    just start the report from the outbreak

          9    session.  We had two very good sessions.  I'd

         10    like to hear back first from the session on

         11    frame comparison of the EIA-3 and EIA-860 and

         12    I understand that Darius is going to

         13    summarize the discussion.

         14              MR. SINGPURWALLA:  I'll take a stab

         15    at it.  We had a really good discussion on

         16    the frame comparison.  A little background on

         17    it really quick for people who didn't sit in

         18    or get a chance to read the paper, the EIA

         19    contracted with the Census Bureau to conduct

         20    five frame evaluations of CNEAF surveys.  For

         21    the spring session it covered more in depth

         22    three of frame evaluations they did for

          1    surveys and for this one they focused on two.

          2    And the two that they focused on were the

          3    EIA-3, which is quarterly coal consumption

          4    and quality report, manufacturing plants, and

          5    860, which is the annual electric generator

          6    report.

          7              And then the goal of the analysis

          8    was to determine whether the EIA had

          9    sufficient coverage of production of solar

         10    thermal collectors and photovoltaic cells and

         11    modules, coal consumption, coke and breeze

         12    production in the manufacturing sector, and

         13    also to identify differences between the

         14    frames and identify characteristics of some

         15    of the missing establishments.

         16              There were five evaluations that we

         17    talked about before and we focused on two.

         18    And then the methodology that they were using

         19    to do the actual frame comparison was a

         20    two-step matching process which we talked

         21    about in pretty good detail.

         22              The first was to match the EIA

          1    reporting units to Census Bureau business

          2    register to determine if the manufacturing

          3    details will be available for comparison and

          4    if that match was found they could do

          5    comparisons on it and analysis.  And then the

          6    step two of the matching manufacturing units

          7    on EIA frames too, manufacturing

          8    establishments from the 2002 manufacturing

          9    energy consumption survey, which is also

         10    known as MECS.

         11              So that's the background of what

         12    they presented to us and at the end of the

         13    day they showed us the results of what the

         14    matching was and it's not up there any more

         15    which is too bad.  But I think the overall

         16    match rate was 70 percent for over the five

         17    surveys.  Is that right?  It was 70 percent

         18    for the electricity generation and 79 percent

         19    for the coal evaluation coverage rate.

         20              Oh, and then they gave us the

         21    ranges overall for the five surveys.  So it

         22    ranged in coverage by establishment counts

          1    from 70 to 92 percent and a range of volumes

          2    in 75 to actually 100 percent.  So, I thought

          3    that they got pretty high, come to think of

          4    it.

          5              After that I think the discussion

          6    focused on what I synthesize as about three

          7    major points.  The first was the two-step

          8    matching process and some of the accuracy of

          9    how that was going on and how they were

         10    actually doing the matches.  And this was

         11    actually pretty interesting to me.  When I

         12    worked for a credit card company back in the

         13    day like five or six years ago we used to get

         14    so much different data from so many different

         15    sources.  We were talking about three

         16    different credit bureaus, name and address

         17    information, and at the end of the day what

         18    we wanted to do was have one specific ID for

         19    Darius Singpurwalla and this could be coming

         20    from so many different sources.

         21              This could be coming from something

         22    as carefully as I filed out like a credit

          1    card application when I just didn't want to

          2    screw it up because I really wanted to get

          3    that credit card and do whatever I wanted to

          4    do with it.  And then you might have

          5    something as sloppy as from maybe a baseball

          6    game and I've had a couple of beers and

          7    they're giving away free hats if I fill out a

          8    credit card application and you get there and

          9    you're not filling it out as like, carefully

         10    as you should.

         11              So, I mean, the matching is

         12    actually from the EIA frame to the Census

         13    Bureau databases.  It's a pretty big problem

         14    and I think the way that you guys are doing

         15    it handling it in a two-step matching process

         16    is really a good and sophisticated way to do

         17    it.  Doing the straightforward matching often

         18    doesn't get you the right results.

         19              Like, my name is a bad example

         20    because it's pretty unique but if we find

         21    someone else who's got like a more common

         22    name like Walter Hill, no offense, you're

          1    going to get a lot of different one to many

          2    matches and it's at that point in time you

          3    narrow it down who the Walter Hills in your

          4    universe are and then you can use further

          5    information that you have to get it down to

          6    the more one to one specific match and show

          7    that that business unit is being accurately

          8    represented in the Census Bureau frame.

          9              And the only further comment I

         10    have, like, when I was with the credit card

         11    company we had, like, 15 different rules and

         12    three levels.  I mean, it was just a huge

         13    headache and it was such a pain in the butt.

         14    I bet that at the credit bureau place we had

         15    a lot more data to play around with than what

         16    you guys are going to do.

         17              So I think it's nice that you

         18    actually got it at, like, something that's a

         19    two-step level.  And if you have further data

         20    that you're not using it might be a nice way

         21    to try and get that implemented to do further

         22    matching roles to get a bigger hit that way.

          1              The second thing that I think that

          2    we talked about and focused on that was

          3    really interesting to me as well was Bill

          4    brought up when we were talking about the

          5    question that they posed to group, what level

          6    of coverage should be considered sufficient,

          7    so we battered around that for a while.  And

          8    then for the coal consumption we had the

          9    number of 79 percent coverage by

         10    establishment there.  What Bill kept bringing

         11    up was asking us to think about some of the

         12    cost benefits that are associated with trying

         13    to get that actual match rate up because in

         14    essence to be able to get that up to a higher

         15    rate they're using a lot of FTE resources.

         16              It takes a lot of work to be able

         17    to boost that up and how much of the

         18    resources should be used to actually try and

         19    get it up and like, what kind of differences

         20    is it going to make to some of your

         21    estimates?  So that was the second point that

         22    we focused on as well.

          1              And then lastly the third one Moshe

          2    brought up as opposed to actually trying to

          3    fix up your frames and getting some of this

          4    matching and coverage correctly what if you

          5    did some sort of focus on correcting the

          6    under-coverage as opposed to fixing the

          7    frames like, looking at trying to provide

          8    better estimates for actually who you're not

          9    hitting as opposed to doing some of the

         10    background work and trying to fix up what you

         11    might not be missing in some of your frame

         12    hits.

         13              So I thought that those were the

         14    three big things that we focused on.  I mean,

         15    as all the talks have been, it's been great

         16    and very interesting to find out a lot more

         17    about this stuff.

          1    Bernstein.

          2              MR. BERNSTEIN:  Well, since two of

          3    the four people who were at the session are

          4    gone now I can say anything I want.  I

          5    compliment the presenters.  It was very

          6    interesting and I don't have to say for the

          7    last time they did present their objectives

          8    up front and I knew what they were trying to

          9    do and I'm very happy that that happened in

         10    the last session at my time here.

         11              So what they did is they presented

         12    some results from a paper they're hoping to

         13    publish shortly on whether futures contracts

         14    in natural gas can help explain spot prices

         15    and came to the conclusion that they can't.

         16    And they asked the committee a couple of

         17    things.  One is should they do this for other

         18    fuels, and our reaction was, well, you don't

         19    really need to.  This pretty much answers the

         20    generic question that you don't really need

         21    to spend the resources unnecessarily asking

         22    the same question for the other fuels.

          6    of the discrepancy, particularly the under-

          7    forecasting of prices that we saw yesterday.

          8    So one of the extensions of this might be

          9    this is not the question of whether futures

         10    prices are a good predictor of spot prices

         11    but whether futures prices can help

         12    understand discrepancies in forecasts.

         13              They also said well, we get

         14    questions like this on all the other fuels.

         15    Do we need to answer them?  We thought no,

         16    but one thing.  They get a specific question

         17    from Hawaii about using future prices at the

         18    PUC and there maybe a role for EIA to do a

         19    little quick analysis answering that specific

         20    question for Hawaii on fuel prices but not

         21    necessarily need to do it generically for

         22    everything.

          1              In fact that may be a really good

          2    use of EIA time in situations where it's

          3    pretty clear that the PUC is heading down a

          4    path of using something that analytically

          5    doesn't make any sense.  It seems to be a

          6    good role for EIA to show them that it

          7    doesn't make good analytical sense.  But

          8    overall we really like the paper and as soon

          9    and I can get one I would really like to have

         10    a copy of it.

         11              And, Nick, anything else?

         12              DR. HENGARTEN:  Yes, there's only

         13    one other thing that was discussed in that

         14    session, namely the idea of if we can combine

         15    both this analysis and the STEO analysis in

         16    the sense that we can compare.  I mean, we

         17    all are saying STEO is not doing good or the

         18    prediction using the options, the futures, is

         19    not very good.  But in fact if we look how

         20    good both of them do it's like comparing the

         21    S&P 500 and what the specific mutual fund is

         22    doing.

          1              And so somehow maybe to use this

          2    either as a benchmark one way or the other to

          3    understand the fact that short-term energy

          4    prediction especially in the natural gas

          5    arena is extremely difficult and is a hard

          6    problem and showing that you know that it is

         12              MR. BERNSTEIN:  The question came

         13    up and the conclusion was futures prices is

         14    not a good predictor.  The question was well,

         15    not good compared to what, and so that's when

         16    we got into discussion of whether it's better

         17    or worse than STEO and how does it compare or

         18    other predictors.

         19              DR. HENGARTEN:  So overall, I mean,

         20    it was a really interesting presentation.

         12    anecdotally that you've got these traders out

         13    there and they all are doing their own thing

         17    tell them push prices up then everybody

         18    starts buying higher prices.

         19              Or you get one trader in one big

         20    company deciding that January is going to be

         21    a tough month and they put in a high futures

          1    well, why did he do that or why did that

          2    company do that.  Maybe we need to do it too.

          3    And then all of a sudden all the lemmings

          4    push the price up too.  So there's a lot of

          5    anecdotal things that don't match what you

         14    do the coal surveys for Energy Information

         15    Administration.  The issue of frames is

         16    mainly at this point in my view one of

         17    prioritizing our work.  We have a very

         18    focused staff and most of our staff time is

         19    spent running the survey, getting the data

         20    back in, QA'ing the data, and getting the

         21    data out to the public in a variety of

         22    reports and we are like this all the time

          1    just to accomplish that.  So what I'd like to

          2    see happen here, and maybe it happens and I

          3    just don't know it, is there are obviously

          4    some indicators here from the work that's

          5    been done on frames that we have a potential

          6    problem.

          7              And I don't know how it ranks in

          8    terms of all of the problems that EIA is

          9    dealing with that managers see but what I

         10    fear is that unless somehow this is put on an

         11    agenda and this information then is presented

         12    to people above me that this will just be an

         13    interesting anecdote to what we do and five

         14    years down the line again we will say oh,

         15    yeah, we studied the frames back there in

         16    2005 and this is what we found but nobody

         17    decided to do anything about it and now it's

         18    a little bit worse or it's not as bad as it

         19    was then and so forth.

         20              So I have a plea here too and maybe

         21    it's a question as well as a plea.  Does this

         22    get translated into something that's a choice

          5    we're going to have to figure that out but

          6    the frames issue, evaluating EIA frames, was

          7    something decided to take a look at in EIA

          8    strategic plan last time.  So the strategic

          9    planners ultimately need to have a good

         10    report about the status of our frames and we

         11    had a frames team that did an internal

         12    evaluation.

         13              I have asked Howard Bradshaw-

         14    Fredrick to talk to the frames team with this

         15    new information to see if we can come up with

         16    a proposal perhaps to talk to this committee,

         17    about next time.  But EIA is also going to

         18    start up strategic planning again sometime in

         19    the spring.

         20              We need to talk about where we are,

         13    emissions to try and track your frame 10

         14    years ago.  Is that data easily available?

         16    because these are data sets maintained by

         17    states.  So if you go to the State of Ohio,

         18    as I did, roughly 24 months or so ago to

         19    their website there's a very large data set

         20    there.  It looks very complete but it has

         21    air, water, land, discharges to land.  It has

          4    electronically because that's what you really

          9    that we already had in the frame and I found

         10    a couple that might have been possible

         11    candidates for being in the frame but I

         12    couldn't find enough information about them

         13    there to really have confidence that I was

         17    is that increasingly EPA is taking over the

         18    regulation of some of those facilities

         19    because they've clamped down so much electric

         20    utilities the discharges from coal burning

         21    and industrial facilities now began to loom

         22    large.  Even though they're small they began

          1    to loom large because so much of it has been

          2    controlled at electric power plants.  So EPA

          3    has a proposal, I'm not too sure how far

          4    along it is, to actually have some federal-

          5    type regulation on those facilities.  At that

          6    point they will have an inventory themselves.

          7    So that would be another way that we could

          8    latch on to something that would help us

          9    quite a bit here if it happens.

         10              DR. SITTER:  But the point is this

         11    could be an interesting research problem at

         12    the masters level for a student and that may

         13    be a way for you to give them an opportunity

         14    and you a resource that you don't have.

         16    from the audience?

         17              Well, thank you very much for

         18    attending this meeting.  I'd like to adjourn

         19    until sometime next spring.

         20                   (Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m., the

         21                   PROCEEDINGS were adjourned.)
