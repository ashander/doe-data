<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><b>1.  <u>Developing Key Energy Indicators</u></b>,  Janice Lent, (SMG) and Joseph Conklin (OOG), EIA</p>
<p>In June of 2007, an inter-office team of EIA analysts and  statisticians was chartered to identify a set of approximately 12 statistics or  indicators to be designated Key Energy Indicators.&nbsp; The selected set of indicators will appear  together, possibly in a prominent location, on the EIA website for the purposes  of </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>providing  a quick, easily accessible <em>overview</em>&mdash;the  &ldquo;big picture&rdquo;&mdash;of the current US  energy situation;</li>
  <li>highlighting,  for the media and the interested public, important <em>changes</em> in the energy situation; and</li>
  <li>increasing  the accessibility of some of EIA&rsquo;s most broadly relevant products.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key indicators will cover a wide range of energy topics,  such as consumption, production, source diversity, use of renewable fuels, and  environmental impacts.&nbsp; In this  presentation to the ASA Committee on Energy Statistics, we described the  inter-office team&rsquo;s progress to date in identifying indicators and discussed  related issues.&nbsp; We then presented the  team&rsquo;s recommended set of selected energy indicators.</p>
<p class=Default style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p>The general thrust of the Committee&rsquo;s comments was that EIA  should publish Key Energy Indicators (KEI).&nbsp;  Most Committee members advocated developing a beta version of the  indicators and putting it online for comment.&nbsp;  Some members also offered to provide testing services for the beta  version, using volunteers from university classes to form informal focus groups.&nbsp; One member pointed out that the KEI could  help energy markets work better by helping consumers understand the energy  situation.&nbsp; Members also felt that  inclusion of market data among the indicators (e.g., wholesale crude oil  prices) was fine, as long as customers were informed that these were not EIA  products.</p>
<p>Some Committee members thought that EIA should develop its  own energy CPI, while others suggested that EIA simply work with BLS to improve  the energy component of the BLS all-items CPI.&nbsp;  Some also remarked that, since different users might want different sets  of indicators, EIA might consider publishing two or three sets (e.g., one for  industry analysts, another for students).</p>
<p>Other suggestions from Committee members included the  following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Use  the indicators to help inform the public about greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Be  aware that energy intensity and carbon intensity indicators could be  misinterpreted.&nbsp; Some experts disagree on  what exactly these measures mean.</li>
    <li>When  you allow users to drill down to from the current indicators to historical  series, give them lots of choices of time intervals.</li>
    <li>Consider  publishing futures prices as well as spot prices.</li>
    <li>Put  links to the trade web sites (e.g., Bloomberg), with disclaimers, on the web  site with the indicators.</li>
    <li>Provide  standard errors or other measures of error for the indicators, at least in  footnotes.</li>
  </ol>
  </ol>
<em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em>
<p>The KEI Subgroup presented its recommendations, including  some of the ASA Committee&rsquo;s comments, to EIA senior staff on December 6, 2007.&nbsp; A project plan detailing the steps that would  be needed to develop a test version of a web-based presentation of the  indicators, has also been drafted and submitted for consideration by senior  staff.&nbsp; The plan includes a testing  phase, during which input would be solicited from Committee members willing to  gather feedback via student focus groups.</p>
<p>Although it would be ideal to provide different indicator  sets for different customers as the Committee suggested, current budget  constraints are unlikely to allow development of multiple indicator sets.&nbsp; With regard to an EIA energy CPI, the KEI  Subgroup recommended its independent development.&nbsp; Improving the energy component of the BLS CPI  may not be possible given the tight time frame legislated for its monthly  release.</p>
<p>A new KEI Subgroup is now being formed to begin developing  the web-based presentation of the indicators.&nbsp;  As resources permit, the new team will consider and discuss the  Committee&rsquo;s other suggestions.</p>
<p style='text-align:left'><b>2.  <u>Building An Information Quality Page For EIA’s Web Site</u></b>, Jacob Bournazian,&nbsp; Lawrence   Stroud and Shawna Waugh, &nbsp;SMG, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'> This break-out session was on a proposal to  build an information quality page on EIA&rsquo;s web site.&nbsp; The goal of the project was to have a  comprehensive location for users to access information relating to various data  quality issues.&nbsp; The proposal arose from  a discussion at the October 2005 conference when the committee responded to a  presentation on investigating data quality issues by comparing the estimates  from different data sources.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p>The committee members recommended to clearly define the  audience that EIA was targeting for this webpage.&nbsp;&nbsp; After reviewing two designs for a web page,  they expressed a preference for the design with less text and &ldquo;less  clutter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The committee recommended  learning how people might come to the quality page and what kinds of  information they access.&nbsp; They suggested  that users may find this type of information easier if it was included on  program office web pages.&nbsp; They also  recommended that some information may be useful to external customers and other  information may be too in-depth for a regular person and may be more  appropriate for internal EIA staff.&nbsp; </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>
<p>EIA reviewed the program office home pages for highlighting  information on data quality that relates to their specific energy markets or  fuel source.&nbsp; Some reports were posted  under the pathway labeled &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; on the respective program office web  pages.&nbsp; EIA is also considering other  redesign issues for its Intranet for presenting other information quality  reports.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><b>3.  <u>Industrial Natural Gas Demand</u></b>, Kobi Platt, EMEU, EIA</p>
<p>Natural gas is an integral  production component for many prominent industries in the United States.&nbsp; In 2006, natural gas deliveries to industrial  consumers measured 6.75 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), or more than 30 percent of  the natural gas consumed for the year.<sup><a href="fall07.htm#ftnote1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; EIA&rsquo;s Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey  (MECS), which is completed every four years, examines the components of  industrial natural gas consumption.&nbsp;  According to the MECS, total industrial natural gas consumption has  fallen roughly 13 percent from 1998 to 2002 (from 7.23 Tcf to 6.30 Tcf).&nbsp; </p>
<p>EIA&rsquo;s short-term industrial  natural gas consumption forecast is based on industrial production indices  which are provided by Global Insight and are based on the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s  Industrial Production Database.&nbsp; The  production indices of key natural gas-consuming industries are identified using  the MECS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the share of natural  gas use in each industry that is identified, EIA is able to generate a  natural-gas weighted industrial production index.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since 2002, the trend of  industrial production derived from the Global Insight indices has been  increasing.&nbsp; However, over the same period,  industrial natural gas consumption in these same industries has been  consistently declining.&nbsp; Analyses of  three prominent natural gas consuming industries&mdash;petroleum and coal products,  agricultural chemicals, and primary metals&mdash;indicates that the associated  production indices may no longer provide an accurate representation of natural  gas use in that industry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This presentation introduced  EIA&rsquo;s methodology for constructing a natural gas-weighted industrial production  index with relevant background information on the primary natural gas consuming  industries that are included.&nbsp; More  importantly, the presentation raised questions about the changing composition  of industrial natural gas use in key U.S. industries.&nbsp; Finally, the presentation concluded with a  round-table discussion centered around ways to improve EIA&rsquo;s short term  forecasting of natural gas consumption in the industrial sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p>Committee members recommended further research into the  price elasticity of demand for natural gas in the industrial sector as well as  the effect of environmental regulations.&nbsp;  Also, it was recommended that additional anecdotal research of natural  gas consuming industries take place&mdash;managers of plants, refineries, and  mills.&nbsp; Finally, members suggested some  comparison of other fuel use over the period in which changes in natural gas  consumption were observed.</p>
<p><strong><em>EIA Intended Response(s):</em></strong></p>
<p>Since the ASA fall 2008 meeting, EIA has conducted anecdotal  research into the operations and fuel consumption at domestic petroleum  refineries.&nbsp; In addition, EIA is  attempting to coordinate a meeting with Federal Reserve staff to discuss their  construction of manufacturing production indices.&nbsp; Finally, EIA will attempt to examine the  issue of price elasticity for specific industries within the industrial sector  in order to draw a reference point for basic assumptions about relationship  between consumption and price.</p>
<p style='text-align:left;background:white'><strong>4.</strong>  <b><u>Model Based Sampling Methodology for the new Form EIA-923</u></b>, Joel Douglas CNEAF, EIA</p>
<p>In conjunction with the launch of the new Form EIA-923  &lsquo;Power Plant Operations Report&rsquo;, the criteria for the monthly sample selection  was adjusted to ensure proper coverage ratios by fuel and facility types within  fixed geographic regions. The sampling methodology focused on the ability to  obtain accurate monthly estimates of electricity generation, fuel consumption, fuel  stocks, fuel receipts, and the cost and quality of fuel delivered to electric  power plants.</p>
<p>The sample selection methodology placed special emphasis on  sample size reduction and the reduction of both respondent and EIA burden.&nbsp; This was especially true for the commercial  and industrial sectors of the electric power industry. </p>
<p>The presentation outlined a five-step process to achieve its  stated goals: 1. Utilizes cutoffs based on plant nameplate capacity. 2. Ensure  proper coverage of published totals 3. Ensure adequate counts within each  estimation strata to ensure accurate imputation for non-sampled facilities. 4.  Ensure acceptable relative standard errors for each published total. 5. Add in  additional facilities whose exclusion from the monthly sample was determined to  be especially detrimental to published totals.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span class="style3"><b>ASA Committee
  Recommendations</b><b>:</b></span></p>
<p>The cutoff sampling methodology was generally  accepted as a good approach to collecting monthly power plant operations  data.&nbsp; No concrete recommendations were  given.</p>
<p><em><strong>EIA Intended Response(s):</strong></em><br>
  EIA is presently assessing the accuracy of the  sampling methodology developed using power plant operations data from reporting  year 2006 on data currently reporting for 2008. The results are encouraging. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><strong>5. </strong> <b><u>The Quality Control Process for Developing the Annual Energy Outlook</u>,</b>&nbsp;Paul Holtberg, OIAF, EIA</p>
<p>The Energy Information  Administration follows a detailed review process prior to release of its major  products.&nbsp; The most extensive review is  typically reserved for those EIA products that receive the most  visibility.&nbsp; This presentation discussed  the process used for quality control/review for the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO).&nbsp; The review and quality control process for  the AEO begins with reassessment of new historical data to update model  relationships and to develop the assumptions that are typically external to the  model dynamics such as a world oil prices and other non-U.S. market behavior.  Such external assumptions are vetted within OIAF and then the rest of EIA  through working groups and a Delphi process.  Once the major external model assumptions are developed, model runs are  examined carefully within OIAF at all levels of staff and management and  discussed at weekly or bi-weekly &ldquo;run review meetings.&rdquo; When the major cases of  the AEO are considered satisfactory by OIAF management and staff, they are once  again vetted through the rest of EIA, including the Administrator and Deputy  Administrator, the EIA Offices, and management and analysts in other Offices.  The analysis and documentation of the runs and the resulting write-ups follow a  similar pattern of review, including both internal Office review and wider EIA  review.&nbsp; After the AEO is released,  feedback from the various stakeholders are solicited to provide input to the  next production cycle. <br>
  Five key questions were posed to  the ASA Committee:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Is  the external review process sufficient?</li>
    <li>Do  we need to expand number or type  of reviewers included in the process?</li>
    <li>Are  there ways in which the review process could be streamlined?</li>
    <li>Are  there other aspects of the AEO  that need to be reviewed?</li>
    <li>How  do we balance need to provide  independent projections and analysis with stakeholder inputs we may not agree  with?</li>
  </ol>
  </ol>
<em><b>ASA Committee
Recommendations:</b></em>
<p>Key  comments from the Committee include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It  is difficult to provide comments on the process without some data on the  &ldquo;accuracy&rdquo; of the projections.&nbsp; Would it  possible at a future meeting to look at statistics comparing actual and  projected data to see how the AEO is performing.</li>
  <li>Maybe  there are too many internal reviews or they are performed too frequent.&nbsp; However, that needs to be balanced by  concerns about releasing a projection that includes serious problems that would  not be caught by a lesser review.</li>
  <li>It  comparing results, it is important to know how the projection compares with  other projections.</li>
  <li>The  assumption adopted in the AEO of including no prospective public policy changes  makes it difficult to gauge the accuracy of the projections when measured  against actual historical data because policy does change.</li>
  <li>The  number of scenarios completed as part of the AEO is adequate to cover market  variation.</li>
  <li>To  evaluate whether the external review process is sufficient, it is important to understand  the type and mix of external reviewers and the questions asked.&nbsp; However, the current process seems to be  very, very extensive.</li>
  <li>I  would strongly recommend not abridging the internal review process.&nbsp; While you may shorten the number of hours it  takes, it is important to maintain the quality of the process.</li>
  <li>The  review process itself provides information to the users of the projection and  may eliminate questions and concerns raised about the projection.</li>
  <li>One  way to lessen the work load would be to do less&mdash;doing the AEO every other year  or only updating parts of the projection&mdash;however, this may not be a good time  to undertake this approach because of the volatility in energy markets.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em>
<p>EIA would be willing to make a follow up  presentation at a future meeting using statistical measures of the projections  accuracy and providing a comparison of the AEO with other projections.&nbsp; We will evaluate the possibility of  streamlining the review process, but we understand that that evaluation needs  to be balanced to maintain the quality of the process.&nbsp; While it is not clear if EIA can do the AEO  once every two years, we will investigate the possibility of following a different  approach.&nbsp; However, given volatility in  energy markets and the importance of energy in public policy right now, we  understand that it is unlikely that any changes in the approach can be  implemented right now.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><strong>6. </strong> <b><u>Using Regression Analysis for Forecast Evaluation.</u></b><u>,</u> George Lady, Consultant to EIA</p>
<p>The presentation was an update on  the on-going SMG forecast evaluation project. At the April ASA Committee  meeting, it was proposed that approximations of National Energy Modeling System  (NEMS) supply and demand modules be developed by using regression analyses on  data sets assembled from NEMS solutions. Given the regression results, the  embodied sensitivities of the endogenous variable to the exogenous variables,  e.g., the price elasticity of demand for an energy product, could be used at a  future time to determine the degree to which assumed versus actual exogenous  variable values would influence forecast accuracy. This particular approach was  proposed due to the practical difficulties of retaining operational versions of  NEMS, and their corresponding development and operating system environments,  for many years into the future. The Committee agreed with this approach, but  recommended that the experimental design for the NEMS-solution data sets be  fashioned based upon the Latin hypercube, or similar, design.</p>
<p>The Committee&rsquo;s advice was  followed. The AEO2007 version of NEMS was taken from archive, compiled, and  used to construct data sets for the regression analyses. The data were formed  from multiple runs of NEMS with selected explanatory variables varied according  to the Latin hypercube experimental design. Regression analyses were then  performed for selected fuels for each of the residential, commercial,  industrial, and transportation demand modules of NEMS. These results were  presented to the Committee. In general, the results were exceptionally good in  terms of statistical fit and significance. The next stage of the project is to  use the regression results in assessing the accuracy of NEMS projections. The  regression results are to be used to differentially assess the sources of  inaccuracy as related to differences between the assumed and actual values for  selected explanatory variables.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>

<p>The Committee found the purpose  of the project to be highly significant and important to an understanding of  the accuracy of NEMS projections. The regression results, and the experimental  design associated with the underlying data sets were approved. SMG was  encouraged to continue the project and undertake the proposed impact analyses  of the sources of error for NEMS projections.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>

<p>Examples of error impact  analyses, and methods for presenting the results of the impact analyses, will  be developed. An assessment of the short-term projections developed using the  Regional Short Term Energy Model (RSTEM) will also be undertaken. It is  proposed for RSTEM to develop an impact analysis directly from model runs, for  which actual values for explanatory variables will be provided and results with  these values compared to projections made with assumed values.</p>
