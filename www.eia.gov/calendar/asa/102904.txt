           4    we'll go ahead and start the meeting.  First

           5    I'd like to ask any committee member, guest,

           6    EIA staff, or member of the public who was

           7    not present yesterday to introduce yourself

           8    from one of the microphones?

           9              MR. WEINIG:  If you are --

          10              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  In that category?

          11              MR. WEINIG:  Directly under a

          12    speaker in the ceiling, it will cause the

          13    thing to wind and break, so we'll use the

          14    other microphone.

          15              SPEAKER:  Okay.

          16              MR. COLE:  My name is Stacey Cole.

          17    I'm from the Bureau of Census, I'll be

          18    speaking here today about the post

          19    stratification we did for the MEC survey.

          20              MR. WEINIG:  Anybody else?

           9    And anyone who did not sign in yesterday is

          10    asked to do so, out front at the break or

          11    before you leave.  Lunch for the committee

          12    will be held at the conclusion of this

          13    session on suggestions for the spring agenda,

          14    lunch is downstairs as usual, and we'll

          15    probably be discussing a variety of things

          16    including future committee appointments and

          17    so on.  So with that I will turn it over to

          18    Joe Sedransk, who will be speaking on data

          19    analysis on the EIA 826 906.

          20              MR. SEDRANSK:  You're doing the

          21    pushing, or I might as well do it.  This is

          22    of course joint work, so as one typically

           1    says when giving the talk, the other -- the

           2    co-author will answer all the questions.  In

           3    any rate, our work is an evaluation of

           4    methodology in current use, but we're not

           5    talking about things we've invented, and we

           6    need to make recommendations to CNEAF about

           7    several things including about methodology

           8    and possibly there's been talk about changing

           9    the sample.  This is just rumor.

          10              But anyway this is the --

          11    background is to estimate -- we're trying to

          12    estimate total monthly sales and revenues for

          13    all non IOU's by end user, first of all IOU

          14    is investor owned utility, and the end users

          15    are residential, commercial, industrial and

          16    other; in all these discussions just forget

          17    about other, we'll just talk about the first

          18    three.

          19              So there are two variables; sales

          20    and revenues.  Other entities such as IOU's

          21    and wholesalers are censused.  So we're

          22    really just talking about the non IOU's

           1    essentially.  861 is an annual census, it

           2    covers everyone and it provides a frame for

           3    the 826 which is a monthly survey used to

           4    provide estimates of total sales and revenue.

           5              And to give you an idea, the sample

           6    size were about 150, 160, 170.  There are

           7    over 2000 in the population of non IOU's.

           8    Sample design is cut off sample which was

           9    developed in the early 90s, and at that time

          10    it included the IOU's which are now censused,

          11    and of course there have been additions and

          12    deletions since then.

          13              Sample coverage rates, I cite

          14    below, they depend 76 percent to 88 percent,

          15    depending on the variable and end user, 68

          16    percent to 95 percent by geographic region.

          17    The estimation procedure: very standard,

          18    linear regression through the origin with a

          19    slope different for different geographic

          20    regions.

          21              So Y is the current 826 value for

          22    company I and region R, X is the past census

           1    value for that company in the region.  The

           2    only thing to bring to your attention is the

           3    variance, sigma squared2 proportional to X to

           4    the two gamma, and the current usage has

           5    gamma as 0.8.  That was developed in the '90s

           6    long before I had any connection with this

           7    thought to be desirable and I could -- we

           8    could discuss this afterwards.

           9              The current method is simply, add

          10    up the units, the sampled units, to get this

          11    sum for a State.  For example, add up the

          12    sample units and make predictions for the non

          13    sampled ones.  It's possible that there are

          14    some added -- there are some outliers and

          15    that might not be included in estimating beta

          16    hat for the non sampled ones but they would

          17    always be added in for the -- to get the

          18    totals, assuming that there has been a check

          19    for outliers and that the value is correct.

          20              Valuation; what we've been doing is

          21    looking at Standard Exploratory Analysis

          22    using scatter plots, standardized residual

           1    plots and so forth.  Then I want to point out

           2    the ten regions that are currently being used

           3    for estimation, that is related to beta R's,

           4    they depend on region and the R's here bring

           5    your attention to the fact that NEA is very

           6    large.

           7              These were developed, I think again

           8    in a year -- early to the mid '90s, based on

           9    temperature and climate considerations.  NEA

          10    is very large; it ranges from and -- possibly

          11    diverse from Maine all the way down to

          12    Maryland.  The other thing to bring to your

          13    attention is West, which is somewhere in the

          14    middle of California divide; there are only

          15    three sample companies in that region.

          16              So with this large number of

          17    regions, the sample sizes as you see, as we

          18    go through here and not too -- pretty small.

          19    Four regions are aggregations of the 10 that

          20    we've looked at at various times.

          21    Occasionally, we'll talk about all the data,

           2    influential and those are the criteria we've

           3    actually -- we've been using.

           4              That's we've been using for

           5    investigation as opposed to what is being

           6    used in the current estimation.  Here are a

           7    couple of -- about the five scatter plots on

           8    top, standardized residual plots down below.

           9    Essentially if you've looked through them on

          10    the website, there's very little that we can

          11    find and suggest that model doesn't fit.  If

          12    you look carefully enough, you'll find

          13    examples where there are things that you

          14    might be a little unhappy about.

          15              But generally the residual plots

          16    look okay.  Here's one, here's another one.

          17    I picked ones where there are decent number

          18    of points, like 14 in this case where you

          19    could see something.  Some of the others, you

          20    can't see much.  If you have only four or

          21    five points, you just can't tell anything.

          22    Here's another one with nine.  Then I put two

           7              Just a quick comment; I apologize

           8    that, there was a gremlin that got in, there

           9    should be a second set of plots and that

          10    should've been on the website.  But a gremlin

          11    got in and the ones, the plots, which were

          12    "the after," these are "the before," this is

          13    the -- you know in another words, this is all

          14    the data, the ones where the things were

          15    removed, never got into the data set, never

          16    got into the -- okay.

          17              Issues and questions; choice of

          18    criteria for deleting, observe values, and

          19    classifying them as outliers, we need to make

          20    a recommendation about that.  Second one:

           1    10, why 11?  It's Hawaii, Hawaii is censused,

           2    and sometimes we call them 10 and sometimes

           3    we call them 11, and that's my fault, it's

           4    really 11.

           5              Smaller number of regions, the four

           6    I cited before, these were examples.  Other

           7    regions could be -- you could use other

           8    criteria for defining the regions based on

           9    temperature and climate.  Another completely

          10    different category is ownership, which we've

          11    looked at.  We don't use the IOUs at all to

          12    make any predictions for the non IOUs.  It

          13    turns out that these seemed to be different,

          14    different in terms of the regression co-

          15    efficients.

          16              But there's a possibility of using

          17    them within the non IOUs, there are also some

          18    sub-sets, including things like the federal

          19    entity, the federal company -- federal

          20    installations.  Unfortunately they may be

          21    different but we can't do much about it

          22    because there aren't very many of them.  I

           1    think something like six to eight.(b) was

           2    something I was looking for advice about;

           3    it's fairly clear, in some cases how you work

           4    from the ground up?

           5              How would one be using ownership or

           6    geography is sort of clear, but suppose you

           7    just started with all these companies and so

           8    you say, how am I going to form the strata

           9    just from basic micro data?  Not so obvious

          10    to me.  You can get the estimates of slopes,

          11    but how trustworthy they are, not so clear.

          12    So this is just methodology working from the

          13    ground up to form a strata.

          14              Okay, number three, deals with

          15    macro-level. We have a lot of extra data that

          16    we're not making any use of, and perhaps that

          17    can be used to retain precision and reduce

          18    the sample size.  And marked here, remember

          19    there are two variables and three end users,

          20    and here are a couple of plots.  Why don't

          21    you look at the bottom one because the colors

          22    are sharp and the before and after is before

           1    -- all the data in "the after" is outliers.

           2              Clearly there is a time series

           3    pattern.  What's plotted here are the

           4    estimated regression co-efficients over a 24-

           5    month period starting from January '02 to

           6    December '03.  And so each point is the

           7    estimated regression co-efficient for a

           8    region.  So first thing to notice there's

           9    clearly a time-series pattern for this.  As a

          10    Bayesian, what I would do -- or contemplate

          11    doing, is, suppose I want to make an estimate

          12    for September '03, I might use the data prior

          13    to that to do a forecast, and if the forecast

          14    mean and the forecast variance be the

          15    empirical mean and variance of a prior

          16    distribution to put together.

          17              I mean this is just a suggestion;

          18    we're looking for other suggestions as well.

          19    I want to -- before going on, I want to

          20    point, this is residential, this is

          21    important, I want to point out one thing so I

          22    don't have to go back to this slide.  Notice

           1    towards September -- let's take any cross-

           2    sectional view, sometimes looks like these

           3    beta hats are very -- they look like they're

           4    estimating the same thing.  In other periods

           5    it looks like there are other groupings.

           6              That there are groupings but it is

           7    not everything together, and some

           8    methodology, which I've been working on for

           9    Years, might be useful for here, in trying to

          10    improve the precision, letting the data tell

          11    which sorts of regression should be combined.

          12    So I'll come back to that.

          13              Here's another one, commercial,

          14    these are again the beta hats, same plot, not

          15    as much seasonality as there was on the

          16    residential.  And then let's look at

          17    industrial and the reason -- one reason is,

          18    this is much less here as well, but note in

          19    the bottom the spike for North-West.  And I

          20    think these plots -- the reason I'm pointing

          21    this out is this is sort of pointed out,

          22    something that maybe very well known to

           1    everybody in CNEAF, but this is sort of an

           2    interesting thing and I'll come back to it in

           3    a second.

           4              These are comparable plots for the

           5    estimates of sigma square, the residual

           6    variance.  It was my assumption before we

           7    started that in fact sigma square might be

           8    quite stable, and you could use some of this

           9    to improve the estimation of sigma2.  If this

          10    is residential, here's commercial, there's

          11    another sort of wild, but most of them behave

          12    very -- they don't change much over time.

          13              This is the one I wanted to point

          14    to; look at the industrial, look at the

          15    bottom; that's that same region we had

          16    before.  So, in the summer -- spring/summer

          17    of '03, there was both a change in beta hat

          18    and this large increase in sigma2, so

          19    something went on.  And this maybe fairly

          20    useful, we have not tracked this down yet.

          21    I've asked one person who a hypothesis about

          22    what happened, but this maybe a useful thing

           1    to look at.

           2              Point number four is about use of

           3    company level longitudinal data, and there

           4    are two examples here.  What is plotted here

           5    is again same 24 months, each point is for a

           6    region, and what's plotted is the monthly

           7    value divided by the annual, divided by 12.

           8    And the annual divided by 12 is to put

           9    everything on the same scales, so they should

          10    operate around one.  And the dark thicker

          11    blue line is the estimated regression co-

          12    efficient for that region over the 24 months.

          13              What are the reasons for this --

          14    you've possibly used utility of these plots.

          15    One is to see whether the large and small

          16    companies, all of them seemed out of the same

          17    patterns; that would be a validation --

          18    informal validation of the model.  The second

          19    is if you see a lot of divergence, is maybe

          20    the stratification -- post stratification

          21    isn't any good.  So here's the second one,

          22    this looks even better from my perspective.

           1    This is a second one, the difference between

           2    these two, these are both residential sales,

           3    one is NWE and one was another.

           4              We've looked at some other -- a

           5    couple of others, which don't look quite as

           6    good as this.  But suggestions looked for

           7    here about what to do with these data of this

           8    sort.  And the last one is what I referred to

           9    before but I want to rephrase now; you have a

          10    choice of a large number of estimation groups

          11    and of course the advantage of that or post

          12    strata, large advantage of that is greater

          13    homogeneity within the groups.  Disadvantage

          14    is small sample sizes within each of the

          15    groups.

          16              Conversely you can have very few

          17    estimation groups and you have a larger and

          18    then you get more heterogeneity but larger

          19    sample sizes.  Methodology that is referred

          20    to, if you've all done your homework and

          21    looked at least at the paper I wrote, alluded

          22    to this research which the data -- a database

           1    pooling of like regression co-efficients.

           2    What it is, is an extension of the Standard

           3    Shrinkage Methodology.

           4              Shrinkage Methodology is kind of

           5    dumb; it just says which things to put

           6    together.  This method is dynamic and it

           7    basically takes the data and tells you which

           8    things to put together; it works quite well.

           9    So the question here with regard to this is

          10    any suggestions about that or other ways of

          11    choosing between large number of estimation

          12    groups or -- and with a consequent gains and

          13    benefits and other things.

          14              Here are the questions for the

          15    committee; they're just actually a repetition

          16    of the five points I just went through now,

          17    and good point to stop.  The first two are

          18    things for which we need to make

          19    recommendations, the last three, any

          20    suggestions about things other than what

          21    we've talked about or comments about

          22    anything.

           1              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  Okay, thanks.

           2    Let me start with quick questions and you

           3    talked about deleting an outlier, so that

           4    really means just setting it into -- setting

           5    it outside the regression, using it as an

           6    observed value?

           7              MR. SEDRANSK:  Yeah, we're assuming

           8    that when such an outlier occurs that there

           9    is contact with the company to make sure the

          10    value is okay.

          11              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  It's not an

          12    omission?

          13              MR. SEDRANSK:  Yeah.

          14              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  Okay.

          15              MR. SEDRANSK:  And that's an

          16    important -- I mean, that's a -- I see

          17    Scott's up there -- you know, I mean, that's

          18    a standard part of practice is  going back.

          19    Right now there are programs that do these,

          20    what we call, scatter plot edits and they

          21    have been used heavily in the past, now not

          22    being used very much.  We think they should

           2              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  And is this cut

           3    off sample maintained or is it pretty much

           4    the same thing?

           5              MR. SEDRANSK:  No in fact that it

           6    was a cut off sample and it's now -- no, it's

           7    not maintained.

           8              MS. KIRKENDALL:  It needs to be

           9    evaluated again?

          10              MR. SEDRANSK:  It needs to be

          11    evaluated.  In fact that was what we were

          12    saying before, as I was saying at the

          13    beginning, there was a rumor about changing

          14    this sample composition.  What happens, I

          15    think it would be fair to say is that,

          16    somebody perceives a problem, maybe in one of

          17    the sectors and in one area and just adds

          18    some sample size to it and it's not done in

          19    an overall principled way, so in fact, it's

          20    not maintained, so this is no longer, you

          21    know, it's no longer a cut off sample.

           2              MR. SEDRANSK:  It does --

           3              DR. NEERCHAL:  You explained it but

           4    I didn't get it.

           5              MR. SEDRANSK:  Oh, they do, oh, you

           6    mean in those plots in the end?

           7              DR. NEERCHAL:  Yes.

           8              MR. SEDRANSK:  Oh, yeah, what I

           9    said in the company level plots, what we try

          10    to do, this was the first attempt, was we

          11    plotted the observed value for the month

          12    divided by annual, which is an estimate of

          13    the slope.  But then the values went all over

          14    the place, so the simple idea, divided by 12,

          15    put the annual over 12 on the same scale as

          16    the month.  So it made the plots -- the plots

          17    look better.

          18              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Is the regression

          19    actually based on the annual over 12 also, so

          20    when you put the regression you'd expect that

          21    to be around one --

          22              DR. NEERCHAL:  Oh.

           3    market trends, or you could show whatever is

           4    going on. But in this case it sort of looks

           5    like it's primarily the seasonality.

           6              MR. SEDRANSK:  Something I should

           7    say, I know Nick is -- I'll just comment --

           8    just remark; part of this work or much of it

           9    is really a warm up, it's like an exhibition

          10    game for dealing with the more complex 906

          11    and 920 surveys that appeared in the original

          12    title.  Those, the data -- the relationships

          13    are not as nice or nowhere nearly as nice is

          14    what they've showed here.  We were trying to

          15    go through the exercise for something that

          16    was, looked good to get sort of what we were

          17    going to do, sort of down pad.

          18              And then the next thing is to turn

          19    to that, which you presumably will hear about

          20    in succeeding talks.  This is the data, it

          21    really is well behaved and when I talked

          22    about the fact that there are these problems,

           1    it's not problems but number three, what you

           2    may like to do is get some more precision, so

           3    that you can reduce the sample size; that's

           4    even more important that the other surveys.

           5    Nick?

           6              DR. HENGARTNER:  You talked about

           7    outliers and things like that, and I looked

           8    at the plots and my first inclination would

           9    be to do everything on a log-log scale.

          10    Because if you look at some of the plots

          11    there, I always have one guy way out there

          12    that drives the regression line and just like

          13    rescaling often things look -- it's just that

          14    the type of plots that's what suggest that --

          15    the other thing, I was wondering you said

          16    shrinkage, were you thinking of mixed effects

          17    models or even hierarchal models?

          18              MR. SEDRANSK:  Yeah, you know that

          19    was what I -- yeah, when I used shrinkage, I

          20    mean -- what I was talking about very

          21    specifically, let's take the example of the

          22    beta hats, if you used -- if you looked, if I

           6    -- I'll stay over here.  Standard Shrinkage

           7    Methodology, look at September '03 where

           8    there is a kind of a large thing, here we

           9    just say, your estimate for one region, take

          10    NWE for example, will be that regression

          11    estimate, weighted average and that of the

          12    others, it's dumb, it doesn't realize the

          13    fact that some of the data, not that all data

          14    doesn't come from a single source.  The

          15    methodology I have developed let's the data

          16    decide which things should go together.

          17              DR. HENGARTNER:  But you could

          18    actually, since you have the time series, you

          19    can think of modeling this d(t) as a function

          20    of (t).  And you mentioned that.

           1    things, right?  I would do -- that's the

           2    first thing is the time series effects are

           3    probably -- in fact you might do it both ways

           4    actually.  You might have both the time

           5    series and all the --

           6              DR. HENGARTNER:  Yes, the next link

           7    are the time series coefficient.

           8              MR. SEDRANSK:  Yes, in fact you

           9    really want to do this both ways, you really

          10    want to do the cross section and the time

          11    series parts of this.  But sort of not the

          12    dumb shrinkage methodology -- well, shrinkage

          13    methodology is same as like mixed effects;

          14    you don't want to assume that the regression

          15    coefficients in some of these time periods

          16    come from the same source.  They don't.  In

          17    other periods they do.  So the real solution

          18    to this which is really interesting

          19    statistical problem is the time series and

          16    it's very simple.  You consider all the

          17    partitions of all those 10 points, put a

          18    prior probability on it, usually equal, and

          19    then within a grouping, within the subset in

          20    the partition, you assume everything is

          21    exchangeable.  It works very well, I develop

           1    is some literature back to the early 90s, and

           2    it works very, very well.  I now have a paper

           3    to show how to do this for small area

           4    estimation, which is really easy to do.

           5              If you start with the estimates --

           6    this is actually really easy to do because

           7    you -- I'm planning to do it, student who's

           8    worked with me on it is very busy.  And  as

           9    soon as we finish -- the reason this is easy

          10    is if you start with the summary statistics

          11    like the regression coefficient is easy.  If

          12    you want to read the papers, biometrical

          13    paper in '92 and one about 2001 is this is a

          14    sinica paper in '99.  But it really works, it

          15    works surprisingly well this --

          16              DR. HENGARTNER:  It sounds what

          17    Hartigan was also doing.

          18              MR. SEDRANSK:  He assumes -- Okay,

          19    he assumes is there's not a mistake in what

          20    he does, ours is much more general --

           2    is, it is.  It's the same, it's the same

           3    thing, we were actually working on it at the

           4    same time, started working on it at the same

           5    time.  He assumed something, we assumed that

           6    the regression coefficients in the subset are

           7    not exactly the same.  He assumes they are.

           8              DR. HENGARTNER:  Yes.

           9              MR. SEDRANSK:  But once you get

          10    into a subset that they have exactly the same

          11    values, we allow variability in that.  And

          12    that's what the difference is.  There's

          13    unfortunately one of his students wrote a

           1              MR. SEDRANSK:  That is exactly

           3    computationally, this would be Bayesian

           4    clustering.

           8    Binder who's doctoral dissertation on

           9    Bayesian clustering, and has some early

          10    papers and it -- was something I looked at

          11    when we had started out.  Now this would be

          12    good.  The hurdle is really that with all

          13    these partitions, unless you have a way of

          14    structuring the population, you get too many,

          15    you just, there are just too many of these.

          16              DR. HENGARTNER:  Couldn't we try to

          17    think in terms of the tree, and somehow --

          18    you know split your things in two and then

          19    four like a CART.

          20              MR. SEDRANSK:  You want to try and

           6    like that, you actually have a prior.

           8              So you get an error and it goes

          11    it may be caught later, and it may not be.

          12    So the thought on the outlier detection was

          13    just take it out and make that outlier so it

          14    doesn't affect your estimate for everybody

          15    else, feedback that information about the

          16    outlier so people can check up on it.  So

          17    it's to try to minimize the impact of one

          18    funny observation on the estimate of the

          19    total that you're producing.

          20              MR. SEDRANSK:  But basically this

          21    is an automatic, sort of an automated

           2    doesn't get as much attention in some ways as

           3    other's do.  So if you don't -- you've got to

           4    have something that's automated.  But you

           5    know -- it's sort of, it's something strange,

           6    really strange happens that you don't get

           8              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I mean sometimes

           9    these are real data to --  there's a huge

          10    changes in the company.

          11              DR. NEERCHAL:  If you classify

          12    something as an outlier, then it will not be

          13    used for the estimate prior?

          14              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes, it would just

          15    not be used on data.  It would be added back

          16    in at the end.

          17              MR. SEDRANSK:  Yes.  We always, we

          18    always use it for -- I mean assuming it's

          19    correct, you know it's deemed to be correct.

           7              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Right actually

           8    that's one thing, there was some discussion

           9    yesterday about over editing.  EIA, we do

          10    editing but we typically do not impute for

          11    failed data.  We try to phone on it,

          12    certainly all the big companies.  So while we

          13    do the editing as an agency, which is across

          14    most of our offices, we do not rely on

          15    imputation for failed data.  So we are a

          16    little different from many statistical

          17    agencies.

           1    another question which I tried to the get the

           2    -- draw out the answer to.  If in a single,

           3    in an establishment survey and you try to do

           4    stratification -- here we're doing post

           5    stratification, not doing stratification --

           6    but you sort of do probably something like

           7    sales or revenue are probably highly

           8    correlated, profits but pretty not -- not may

           9    be profits, sales and revenues, it's

          10    stratify, if you had the opportunity -- you

          11    would just do something like the cumulative

          12    square root of F method, which is been around

          13    for forty, or forty or more years.

          14              This case you don't have that,

          15    you're looking for common features of the

          16    regression coefficients.  So I just have

          17    question about how you might build up strata,

          18    just forget about climate and temperature.  I

          19    mean this is not smart, just totally forget

          20    about it.  How do you sort of build -- how do

          21    you build up strata from the ground up, is

          22    the only way I can describe it, any ideas?

           4    post strata, yes, yes, right.  Or turn it

           5    around and say we're getting a new -- they

           6    were in cut off samples, as far as you're

           7    doing a probability design, performance

           8    strata in the first place.  I'm not

           9    suggesting we're doing this but --

          10              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Actually one thing

          11    for all of these observations, we do have the

          12    state that they operate in.  So we can look

          13    at any different groupings that we think we

          14    need to.

          15              MR. SEDRANSK:  Yes.  It's just I

          16    was thinking of a just primitive method, or

          17    where you start from.  I mean there are

          18    things you can do, you can just get estimates

          19    of the regression coefficients that are just

          20    monthly over annual, you have a whole batch

          21    of them for each company.  I just - I mean

           5    based thing makes sense, although I think the

           6    ones we've got are -- I think ones we've got

           7    -- I think there are some other units.  I did

           8    that and I'd be surprised -- this one just

           9    looks too large, that north east one.

          10              DR. SITTER:  Well, I mean you could

           6    that I should say is this the original system

           7    and the estimation methods were done by Jim

           8    Knob who was hiding up there or who is trying

           9    hiding up there, in the active performance in

          10    alternative fuel.  And he presented a lot of

          11    the information to the ASA committee back in

          12    the early the 90s, I think some of it was

          13    when Joe was the chair of the committee.  So

          14    this is an example of a problem that keeps

          15    coming back.

          16              MR. SEDRANSK:  I mean essentially

          17    things are working well here, and this is

          18    sort of a prototype.  But there are these

          19    issues, there is certainly desire to cut back

          20    sample size, may be not so much in this one

          21    as in 906 and 920.  So can one make use of

          22    this time series, information is also issues,

           1    you know academically it's of interest

           2    whether you can make some use of it.  One of

           3    the problems which we did not allude to is

           4    there was a major in the time series when

           5    you're going to have trouble making a longer

           6    time series because in 2004 there was a major

           7    shift that other was sent away and replaced

           8    by transportation.  So that was a -- so

           9    you've got a problem of different

          10    distribution among those end users after

          11    that.  That's one of the reasons we don't go

          12    after 03, then 02 and 03 are -- you know are,

          13    are clear cut, so we won't have a long --

          14    one at the census bureau also recently which

          15    I now can't remember, carrying those small,

          16    small area overtime, there's a - they've been

          17    doing it this way, but I detected that

          18    they've got some of the same structure

          19    problem.

          20              DR. HENGARTNER:  Joe, have you

          21    thought of looking at this as a geo temporal

          22    process?  And I'm now thinking, I know the

           1    location of each of the generators, right?  I

           2    always thought that there is some spatial

           3    correlation instead of just grouping them

           4    into regions, let's look at some kind of a

           5    diffusion those must be correlated in some

           6    ways.  And we have awesome barriers like the

           7    mountain ridges, whatever, I mean we actually

           8    know about the geography.

           9              MR. SEDRANSK:  No, we haven't

          10    because we've looked at really, we're

          11    evaluating their methodology, it doesn't --

          12    by the way it's a good idea --

          14    asking for what goes through my mind --

          15              MR. SEDRANSK:  No, no, that's a

          16    good -- no this is.  I'm down on, --I'm down

          17    geo spatial stuff, I have a student who's

          18    been working on a problem and I don't want to

           5    forward with this process, came out to census

           6    few times, listened, gave comments, and then

           7    told us to go ahead, Bob Adler, who was the

           8    other survey manager I saw, my co-survey

           9    manager from EIA who also worked very hard,

          10    and Tom Lorenz who some of you heard from

          11    yesterday, survey analyst from EIA who came

          12    out for census quite a bit to work with our

          13    team on data analysis and preparing reports

           6    then he's going to get in to the actual Post

           7    Stratification methodology and then we have

           8    some results of what we implemented to talk

           9    about.  And then, finally we have some

          10    questions for the panel that we'd like to

          11    consider, some questions about the

          12    methodology that we implemented for this

          13    survey, and if time permits we'd also like to

          14    talk a little bit about what we might

          15    consider in the future given the time frame

          20    provide detailed data on energy consumption

          21    for the manufacturing sector.  We provide a

          22    variety of information from individual energy

           5    technologies that are implemented in

           6    manufacturing establishments as well as their

           7    ability to switch to alternative fuels in

           8    certain situations.

           9              The survey was initiated in 1985,

          10    it was conducted every three years until the

          11    survey year 1994 and it's been conducted

          12    every four years since that point.  The

          13    economic census, just some general

          14    information, provides a detailed portrait of

          15    the nation's economy.  We provide data on

          16    industry as well as geographic, we provide a

          17    variety of maniputable formats for data users

          18    such as CD-ROM's, we have an American Fact

          19    Finder on our website where the data user can

          20    go in and get data and create their own

          21    tables.

          22              The census is conducted every five

           6    was the second census conducted using these

           7    classification definitions.

           8              Okay, and the census provides a

           9    comprehensive update of the classifications

          10    that are contained in the Census Bureau's

          11    business register.  A lot of the companies

          12    within the business register do not get

          13    Census Bureau questionnaires every year.

          14    Therefore, the update path that we have from

          15    them to update their classifications is done

          16    through the census.

          17              I want to talk a little bit about

          18    the 2002 economic census for the

          19    manufacturing sector.  The census bureau does

          20    not mail every establishment in the country a

          21    questionnaire.  We have what's called a

          22    non-mailed file, it is defined as single unit

           1    manufacturing establishments with less than

           2    five employees and these establishments were

           3    not mailed questionnaires.  For the year

           4    2002, this file contained approximately

           5    160,000 establishments.

           6              The Census Bureau uses

           7    administrative data from other government

           8    agencies to estimate for these establishments

           9    and they account for approximately 3 percent

          10    of the published totals.  Now, if you have a

          11    non-mailed file, then you have a mailed file,

          12    and the definition of the mailed file is the

          13    ones you don't -- the ones you sent

          14    questionnaires to.  They are the single unit

          15    establishments with more than five employees

          16    and all multi-unit manufacturing

          17    establishments were mailed questionnaires.

          19    have those addresses?

           4    addresses come from those, and others would

           8              MR. HOUGH:  Okay, the mailed file

           9    contained approximately 200,000 manufacturing

          10    establishments for the survey year 2002.

          11    Okay, the data that's collected during the

          12    census from the manufacturing establishments

          13    -- we collect operational data on employment,

          14    receipts, inventories, costs, assets,

          15    purchase services, et cetera.  Among the cost

          16    data we collect from the establishments are

          17    cost of fuels and cost of electricity.

          18              And when Stacey comes up, he's

          19    going to read for quite a bit to this cost of

          20    energy, that is what we use to define the

          21    cost of energy.  We take the cost of the

          22    fuels reported and the cost of electricity

           3    to defer now to Stacey and he's going to

           4    start off by talking a little bit about the

           5    sample design.

           6              SPEAKER:  Which one's up?

           7              MR. COLE:  Good Morning.  Basically

           8    my area was responsible for going to in

           9    developing a sample design for the MEC

          10    survey.  The key goal of MECS is to produce

          11    detailed aspects of energy consumption at the

          12    national level for industries as well as

          13    regional level for industries.  The target

          14    population is basically the mail panel of the

          15    -- every portion of the census.  Single

          16    location establishments with more than five

          17    employees and all multi unit establishments.

          18              The mail file was used as just

          19    said, every establishment in the mailed file

          20    was classified to a specific industry code,

          21    and everyone has to sign cost of energy data

          22    which came from historical sources.  For many

           1    cases the cost of energy data came from the

           2    2001 annual survey manufacturers, for other

           3    cases it came from the 1997 government

           4    census.  So in some cases, it's very, very

           5    old.

           6              We used a salvation approach to go

           7    through the sample, there were 473 specific

           8    manufacturing industries, way too many to

           9    cover in detail for MECS but fortunately

          10    energy use is concentrated to a great deal.

          11    There are 37 industries that are of high

          12    interest to EIA, for the most part these

          13    account for almost half of the energy

          14    consumed in manufacturing.  The balance of

          15    the -- the remaining 440 -- 400 and whatever

          16    is -- 436 whatever it is -- industries were

          17    collapsed to higher levels, so between both

          18    groups that cover the can clear the entire

          19    sector of manufacturing.

          20              And also there was a desire for

          21    some states and some sub- national level

          22    data, so we collapsed the stage to Census

           4    establishments.  The allocation was also

           5    challenged, we have a sample of only 15,000

           6    establishments.

           9    the collection unit, the collection unit as

          10    well as the sample unit, and also the

          11    collection unit.  We have a sliding scale of

          12    reliability constraints, basically we think

          13    the cells that have the most amount of

          14    activity are the cells of the highest

          15    interests, so we tried to do a really good

          16    job in the cells with a lot of activity.

          17              The smaller cells have fairly high

          18    C V constraints to inflation.  I believe the

          19    C V constraints range from 2 percent to about

          20    10 percent.  Again the big cells had higher

          21    constraints.  The section approach basically

           1    one of the 267 stratum, within each stratum,

           2    we've a PPS approach.  The establishment size

           3    does matter, establishments that have a large

           4    consumption of energy had a -- a very high

           5    problem with selection.  Again, the energy

           6    data we had for such level came from the year

           7    19 -- 2001 ASM or historical data.

           8              We also imposed a minimum

           9    probability of.02, this helps to prevent in

          10    the cases where we end up with large weights

          11    and surprisingly large data, which causes

          12    problems for estimation as well as the

          13    variances.  Estimation is really a four-stage

          14    process, I only have three on here, but the

          15    first stage is obviously to collect the data

          16    and like most surveys, we do not get all the

          17    mailed cases in.  There's a small amount of

          18    all that -- not a small amount, there's about

          19    a 25 percent non-responses rate to a survey.

          20              We mailed out 15,000 forms and we

          21    got about 12,000 back in.  Historically we

           2    The first and third board there, I think,

           3    we've done historically in MECS.  The middle

           4    board is something basically brand new.  In

           5    non- response weight adjustment process, we,

           6    no, go back a second, we did it by stratum.

           7    With each stratum we said, we broke down in

           8    to sub-stratum, we said within each stratum

           9    there are certainties and non-certainties,

          10    response rate varies between the two

          11    subgroups, and we wanted to go through and

          12    adjust their weights separately.  That's also

          13    an enhancement for 2002 MECS.

          14              It is basically a standard form of

          15    the non-response weight adjustment, where the

          16    numerator is basically equal to the weighted

          17    data from the entire sample on a sample frame

          18    and the denominator was the observed data

          19    from respondents, I'm sorry, it's the data

          20    trivial to respondents.  So every response in

          21    the cell that did the adjustment factor is

          22    equal to 1.  In most cells that one didn't

           4    concerned about sample frame.

           5              Basically we are using a 2002 mail

           6    file, we are worried about the coverage of

           7    the target population, we are worried of the

           8    classification of the el, and we are worried

           9    about the cost of energy data being accurate.

          10    The coverage, we know that the mailed file

          11    includes records that will ultimately not be

          12    in your factory when your mail questionnaire

          13    is censused, they'll come back in

          14    re-classified into wholesale, retail or

          15    construction or other areas.

          16              Initially there were cases data

          17    being mailed as retail/ wholesale for census,

          18    they can be classified in manufacturing.  You

          19    know, that's a problem.  In addition, we have

          20    cases that -- the classification within

          21    manufacturing will have changed between 1997

          22    and 2002 and this affects the thin strata of

           1    variability, and the cost of energy data is

           2    also a problem because it's quite volatile

           3    year to year, in addition for most of the

           4    records, the last testimony of the

          16    establishments.  So we were able to go

          17    through and basically re-assemble the frame

          18    based upon the more current information,

          19    which is what we did.

           1    also developed an estimate of that from the

           2    sample cases in that stratum, so we were able

           3    to do a comparison between the target

           4    population energy data and the sample

           5    estimate of that, and here's a graph that

           6    shows the comparison between the actual and

           7    the estimated total.

           8              For the most part, the estimates

           9    are pretty close to the actual data, but

          10    there are a handful of cells where the

          11    estimate is quite a bit higher than the

          12    actual total from the census.  Look at those

          13    cells and determined that -- that cause was

          14    caused primarily by the big weight and big

          15    data problem, had some cases we thought they

          16    were quite small, but in reality they end up

          17    being quite large.

          18              So we had a handful of cells where

          19    the estimates was quite a bit greater than

          20    the actual population total.     We are

          21    looking for a function that will go back and

          22    adjust the sample weights of the sample

           1    cases, so that the weight adjusted estimate

           2    will equal the controlled total.  We wanted a

           3    function where we didn't adjust the weights

           4    of a certainty cases.  They are a

           5    self-representing cases during the selection

           6    process and we want them to remain that way

           7    during the estimation process.

           8              We also wanted to avoid a problem

           9    of lowering weights on non-certainties to the

          10    point where they became less than one, which

          11    is kind of a hard concept to understand,

          12    weight less than one.  So we develop a

          13    process where the K is our factor, K is

          14    linear, it goes to the point 1.1 and 1.1 is

          15    the axis, it swings round that at a point,

          16    and it's the purple area, if we have the

          17    estimate as less than the population, we have

          18    to adjust the weights up.

          19              In the blue area, we are saying

          20    basically the estimate is greater than the

          21    population and we have to adjust the weights

          22    downward.  That's the graphic display.  And

           1    here's the actual formula that we used,

           2    basically numerator represents the amount of

           3    energy data associated with establishments

           4    are not part of the sample.  Basically it's

           5    the cap end of the total, the first time is

           6    the published total, and the second time is

           7    what we observe in the MECS sample.  So

           8    basically the numerator is what was not in

           9    the MECS sample.  And the denominator is

          10    basically an estimate of the numerator.

          11              So hopefully, our ratio is close to

          12    one, and if it's one, we are really happy.

          13    The sample was -- after we get the case for

          14    each stratum we go back and we adjust the

          15    sample weights further by the K.  Just look

          16    at the top of the slide there, you can see

          17    that the certainty cases, the cases where

          18    WI=1, are never going to be adjusted.

          19    They're going to remain -- retain their

          20    sample weight of one, and never will it get

          21    to miss an adjustment, but it's not a linear,

          22    but not proportionate.

           1              In my example I have got myself --

           2    got cable.8.  The first by the weight of two

           3    goes done by only 10 percent to 1.8 but the

           4    weight of 20 goes down by almost 20 percent

           5    down to 16.2.  So basically the

           6    establishments with higher sample weights are

           7    more impacted by the adjustment than the

           8    cases with small sample weights.  And I just

           9    said that, okay actually in truth when we

          10    classify the population and develop a control

          11    total, we had almost a 1,000 establishments

          12    that switched strata within manufacturing.

          13    It's a little high than we expected but they

          14    have often verified.

          15              The overall impact on the estimate

          16    of the energy at the national level was to

          17    provide the down load by about 1.8 percent.

          18    About half this stratum was just up and half

          19    went down.  So we are pretty pleased it

          20    wasn't anything systematically suggesting

          21    that we had a upper bias, redundant bias and

          22    for the cells that were adjustable, that were

           2    little under 4 percent well, 3.7 percent.

           3              So we weren't making major

           4    adjustments on most of the cells.  There were

           5    a handful of cells that went down by a 30 or

           6    40 percent.  The color adjustment, this has

           7    been done in the past, this is not a new

           8    activity for MECS.  The sample frame is a

           9    mail file, it does not include those were

          10    identified after we mailed out the census and

          11    not they are not part of the mail file, they

          12    are not put in the estimates and in addition

           4    they were advanced, so we drew a sample of

           5    them.  So our sample represents the number of

           6    deaths in the actual frame, so these cases

           7    can be removed from MECS, and they were.

           8              But the births and the -- in the

           9    transport and manufacturing were not in a

          10    sample frame and yet they are still part of

          15    births and incoming transfers who were a part

          18    developed a revised stratum cost of energy

           4    applied that to establishments in each cell.

           5    This is done at each one of the cells levels.

           6    About 3/4 of the strata were adjusted upward.

           7    The remaining quarter, they were no births or

           8    there no incoming transfers, cases like

           9    chemical plants and refineries, pulp mills

          10    are not likely to have incoming transfers and

          11    their adjustment was about 3 percent.  So

          12    that point we finished the process we had

           6    change into both. Does that have an impact?

           9    to that or something like that?

          10              DR. HENGARTNER:  I mean the analogy

           2    variances on the -- before and after the non

           3    response adjustment and after the K

           4    adjustment and about 80 percent of the

           5    variances went down.  But our big question

           6    became, how would me measures bias and that

           7    was something we hadn't come up with yet and

           8    we are so interested in knowing how to

           9    approach and attack that problem.

          10              DR. FEDER:  Actually you also

          11    talked about -- felt that the stage for my

          12    question is, could you do stimulations to

          13    examine the bias issue, because by looking at

          14    your formula it's not apparent to me that

          15    there is no bias here because of the

          16    selection issue because you are changing the

          17    weights in a disproportional way, so

          18    obviously the Horowitz-Thomson is out of the

          19    window, so I would recommend doing some

          20    stimulation and see again, if you get good

          21    results I think I certainly would say that

          22    the good paper here.

           1              Now I -- then you revise you

           2    approach, because I haven't seen something

           3    quite like it but it might make sense.  And

           4    actually not just bias or variance, I would

           5    look at them into -- together, because any

           6    calibration method might introduce some bias

           7    but reduce there miniscule error and this

           8    after all would be after, I mean, a little

           9    bit of bias is okay, I learnt from Randy.  I

          10    have questions for Randy although quite a bit

          11    older I mean his contribution is just obvious

          18    and I was wondering, have an idea I could

          19    just bounce off, see it works but I was

          20    thinking of using the actual survey data to

          21    get a regression but then also modeling some

           2    not in the sample then would have much more

           3    variability as opposed to just having measure

           7              DR. FEDER:  One of the things that

           8    you could also do -- stimulation is pretend

           9    that 20 percent you assembled that responded

          10    and 20 did not respond, take them out and try

          11    to figure a method that would give you

          12    anything close to what you actually have.  So

          18    know -- you play God, you make them no

          19    respond, and then you see you will have to

          17    calibrate if you include in you calibration

           1    then you have to worry about attenuation

           2    which is a few random weights.

           3              DR. FEDER:  It's a very complex

           4    thing.  That's why I think if you do

           5    something in relation it could be some

           6    cancellation of some of these errors.  I

           7    think it's and interesting approach affecting

           8    the issue but you know, that the people that

           9    represent themselves on the weight response

          10    would be not change their weight but go until

          16    if you look at the papers that I would give

          17    to you none of them actually proved any

           5    constraints, you're disproportionably

           6    adjusting the weights and that's really going

           7    to play a role and that you know, if you just

           8    sort of set up an obvious fixed framework as

           9    N goes to infinity, you are fine but you have

          10    to imagine a situation where those

           8    is even more important because we are dealing

           9    with a very ---- population which is also the

          10    measure of size, the energy consumption, so I

          11    think when you do this disproportionate wages

          12    adjustment, it might have an attenuated

          13    effect and I think it is really worthwhile to

          17    were able to do this this time because this

          18    -- MECS is currently conducted every four

          19    years.  The census is conducted every five.

          20    This is the first time that the two surveys

          21    fell in the same survey year.  So we were

          22    able to pull a sample from a mail file and

           1    stratify to a final file.

           2              In the future for example, in '06,

           3    we will pull the sample from the completed

           4    '02, which is what we stratified to here.

           5    But things like Stacy talked about will

           6    happen.  We do an annual survey on

           7    manufactures, which is a sample of the

           8    census, that kind of fills the gaps between

           9    census years for manufacturing data.  So the

          10    question would be, if we consider doing this

          11    in the future and the two surveys don't

          12    coincide, is there anything we should

          13    consider if we think about stratifying to

          14    another sample of the census.

          15              So we would want to use, say the

          16    annual survey manufactures are the control

          17    total?  Is there anything we should consider

          18    in doing that, I mean those actual control

          20    one thing, the estimates will themselves

           2              DR. SITTER:  Well, I think you are

           3    going to run into, I mean conceptually run

           4    into same issues that we saw yesterday with

           5    the Natural Gas essentially.  I mean there is

           6    going to be a change in the relationship over

           7    time because you sort of have certain

           8    determined your stratification on the basis

           9    of old information and the relationship is

          10    going to change over time.

          11              So looking at it back over time and

          12    what's happened you may see a pattern as to

          13    how those things might change.  I am speaking

          14    incredibly, vaguely your problem is much more

          15    complicated then the one that was presented,

          16    well, ultimately that's going to be the

          17    problem, it's a lag problem.

          18              MR. HOUGH:  Right.

          19              DR. FEDER:  And in '06 it will be

          20    -- the census data would be as old as

          21    possible because in '07 you're going to have

           3    analysis the '06 data once you get the '07

           4    census in at least it will be more up-to-date

           5    than the '02 census.  Or reanalysis it and at

           6    least assess the impact of the uncertainty by

           7    the way, but I would at least try to analysis

           8    the '06 MECS with the '07 census.  We have

           9    been -- our surveys of individuals are a

          10    problem because we use census data which is

          11    only 10 years in the -- analyzing unlike in

          12    Canada and so we sometimes use a 10-year-old

          13    census to calibrate our population estimates.

          14    And as you know, there was quite a surprise

          15    because the last census -- some of the

          16    demographics, clearly we face the same

          17    problem.  But they do projections for the

          18    inter census years, I don't know if anything

          19    is prevalent here.

          20              DR. HENGARTNER:  The problem is of

          21    course because the countries addressing,

           4              DR. HENGARTNER:  Yes.

           5              MR. HOUGH:  Well, we would use the

           6    -- rederive the cost of energy from the

           7    annual survey manufacture, the most

           8    reasonably the survey manufactures.  So we

           9    will mail the 2006 MECS at the beginning of

          10    '07 and as we process that, the annual

          11    survey, I mean the 2006 annual survey

          12    manufactures will be processed.  So by the

          13    time we get to where we are ready to publish

          14    our estimates, we will have an '06 ASM data

          15    base to reestablish the control totals.  But

          16    my question was that since we were able to do

          17    it this time to the census which is the

          18    universe which doesn't contain any sampling

          19    error and doesn't you know, it contains all

          20    those smaller establishments.

          21              In the ASM, the smaller

          22    establishments are sampled with weights, so

           1    they're representative of other smaller

           2    establishments, so the control total would

           3    contain some level of error.  Whether or not

           4    we should consider that when we think about

           5    doing this again, you know, we could analysis

           6    the data certainly and look at.

           7              DR. FEDER:  Can I go back to the

           8    original question of the weight adjustment.

           9    Looking at the formula, I see one thing, I

          10    think someone, Nick said that it's likely or

          11    that as many small companies won't respond

          12    and the larger ones will but let's assume for

          13    the moment that the opposite happened.  So

          14    many companies that had to weight of close to

          15    one do not respond, the other company that

          16    had the weight close to one which are more

          17    like them, their weight will me adjusted much

          18    if you look at the formula, which ones will

          19    get adjusted, the ones that had the weight

          20    far away from one.  So I'm worried about bias

          21    here.

          22              And that's why a simulation of

           1    their first, can I propose, may not be the

           2    best because may be the way the population is

           3    it's not so bad and my concern is not so

           4    real.  If you take the other kind of

           5    validation by throwing away 20 percent of

           6    your sample, just saying 20, some part of the

           7    sampling, see the impact, you will able to do

           8    it and I really like what Rick suggested

           9    doing based on the weight.

          10              Make it's own respondents, two

          11    exercise, one with those that have weights

          12    are close to one and study the impact and one

          13    which would tend to be large companies.  Self

          14    representing, close to being self represented

          15    and then another exercise when you make the

          16    non-respondent fictitious with churn the

          17    respondents to ones that have weights far

          18    away from one and see the impact.  Because in

          19    theory, this estimate in my opinion would be

          20    general bias just because of the phenomena --

          21    knows nothing about because it's tends to not

          22    alter the weight of units that have weights

           3    in the same way, that's my concern.  It might

           4    not be a problem with your population, that's

           5    why I --

           6              MR. HOUGH:  The reality of the

           7    survey is that the coverage rate is about 89

           8    percent, so we are getting those large

           9    companies and the majority of the

          10    non-response is absolutely, definitely in the

          11    higher weight and smaller establishments --

          12    so I think if we do this simulation, we

          13    assume that some of the certainty cases are

          14    non response, you are going to see a lot

          15    different look to these ways.

          16              MR. COLE:  We know who the non

          17    response were.  And we could tell them to

          18    look at their size, and we could probably go

          19    through and say, well, looking at the

          20    respondents can we stimulate in our response

          21    to be a mirror image of the non respondents.

           1    cases didn't respond and look at the

           3    them had not responded either, what would

           4    have been the impact on the weights.  We do

           5    have -- most big cases do respond, most small

           6    cases don't respond.  Well most of the

           7    respondents are small.  But it think if we go

           8    through just stimulate random non response, I

           9    don't think it was random.  I think there was

          10    a pattern with small cases not responding.

          11              DR. FEDER:  So use what you know

          12    about the non response --

          14              DR. FEDER:  Like the weight

          15    distribution and actually that might --

          16              MR. COLE:  Good point.

          17              DR. FEDER:  Support this approach

          18    because then you are saying that companies

          19    that have big size, their weight is close to

          20    one, their weight shouldn't be changed, so

          21    may be it's okay, I think we need to validate

          22    this but if you don't put this into

           1    consideration just on general principles,

           2    this is a biased approach but it's not if

           3    your big companies respond, big companies

           4    that have the weight close to one.

           5              MR. COLE:  Right.

           6              DR. FEDER:  And again a bias is not

           7    always so bad if we tell the miniscule error.

           8    That's why we have look that miniscule error

           9    are notified.

          10              DR. HENGARTNER:  Well, except that

          11    in this case the bias can be a problem

          12    because errors and variables, we have found a

          13    big consistency.  That means you will not

          14    estimate what you want to even

          15    asymptotically.  And so unless you are

          16    careful with what you are doing and that is I

          17    think what Randy is saying is that you need

          18    to careful how you do your asymptotically in

          19    the first place.

          20              So usually bias is another small

          21    problem because it's vote of one over the end

          22    and I went over the sample size where

           5              MR. SLANDA:  I remember one NAICS

           6    by region that we are looking at, there was

           7    only one or two of them that was like that

           8    and they had the certainties reported and

           9    then there were some non certainties that

          10    were shifted in from another NAICS code

          11    region I think that's what I should say and

          12    they were non reporters and it ended up

          13    getting or actually maybe non reporters but

          14    they were non selects because they were in

          15    the population but not necessarily in the

          16    sample and the measure of size for the cost

          17    of energy was higher than that -- for one

          18    company was hirer than for any of the

          19    certainties.  So that cost just in that one

          20    cell it caused a little problem but the other

           2              MR. SLANDA:  We had to look at that

           3    for a while.  It can happen.

           4              DR. HENGARTNER:  You need to be

           5    careful here.

           6              MS. WAUGH:  One of the other

           7    thoughts and it s related to the fourth

           8    question about metrics is that EIA publishes

           9    this data along with shadow tapes of the

          10    relative standard errors and I think it would

          11    be useful if the committee could address what

          12    tables EIA must want to publish that would

          13    communicate to the users about the errors

          14    associated with the data.  And the other

          15    thing you should know is that when they

          16    publish the data they may withhold it because

          17    of non-disclosure or they may not publish the

          18    data due to quality, so if they have a

          19    relative standard error of fifty, they won't

          20    publish the data.

          21              DR. SITTER:  Then there's no

          22    problem.

           1              MS. WAUGH:  Well, actually our data

           2    users may consider that a problem.

           3              DR. SITTER:  That's too hard, I

           4    think.

           5              DR. FEDER:  One of the things that

           6    I know in my limited experience, this is just

           7    a suspicion is that a lot of what we do in

           8    variance estimation is still based on the

           9    unrealistic assumption that the weights are

          10    in fact the inverse conclusion probabilities,

          11    in other words the Horwitz-Thompson weights

          12    and we ignore post stratification and

          13    response adjustment, to some extent, and

          14    implication variance although some people on

          15    this committee have done some work on that,

          16    but we don't practice what we preach on that,

          17    and there are a lot of things that we don't

          18    do, and we need to and I think a reality

          19    check is really a good idea.

          20              And again, I want to iterate again

          21    that part of it can be done by doing the

          22    exercise I've proposed, but you're right.

           1    But in practice people used the weights and

           2    say "if I have a weight of 2 that means the

          14    mentioning the issue of thinking about post

           4    optimized for economic rather than energy so,

           5    I don't know whether that would have anything

           6    to do with the thought of using a post

           7    stratification where the numerator is now at

           8    different type of estimates based on a

           9    different type of sample other than a --

          10              DR. SITTER:  But it's done

          11    essentially independently, correct?

          15    falling into the sort of two phase sampling

          16    idea, I mean if you would do the simplest

          17    possible calibration on a previous survey

          18    based on a bigger sample, therefore you think

          19    it is more accurate than you're really in a

          20    two-phase situation.  So I'm sure that that's

          21    essentially what you are ending up in and now

           5    issue then --

           6              MR. HOUGH:  Well, I'm comfortable

           7    with that definitely the size of the

           8    establishment and energy use are correlated

           9    and the ASM will pick up the largest

          10    establishments because those are the ones

          11    that have the most effect on economic data.

          10    as, like for example, we pull a sample, if

          15    strata's of these certainty cases, then you'd

           1    the point where the control total from '06 is

           2    drastically different, then that may have an

           3    effect.  But if the strata remains relatively

           4    level from '05 to '06, the certainty cases

           5    are driving those estimates.  I don't know if

           6    the weight effect would be, can you think of

           7    anything?

           8              MR. COLE:  I think that the process

           9    should, not only adjusting the weights of the

          10    non-certainties there is no impact for

          11    certainties, they are basically wiped out, in

          12    a way that it's not there.

          13              MR. HOUGH:  Okay, it's different

          14    from one doesn't mean we have a bad estimate

          15    itself, it means we have bad samples on

          16    certainty but the total being driven by

          17    certainty, in that case, you still have a --

          19              MR. HOUGH:  You still have a very

          20    good estimate, even though we had bad samples

          21    on certainties.

           1    question about what to do just when the

           2    survey data are old and you know, like an old

           3    thing, - I want to mention some things that

           4    my colleague Jim Kromy, once -- he had some

           5    thoughts, he said to me, you know the census

           6    data, I'm talking about the Census of

           7    population is conducted every ten years and

           8    what do you do, that's nine years after the

           9    Census, we use the Census Projection and we

          10    use them to calibrate our large scale survey

          11    which has about seventy thousand respondents,

          12    I'm talking about the household survey of

          13    drug use, which is a distant theory has

          14    unbiased estimates.

          15              So why do you calibrate an unbiased

          16    large scale sample which is - supposedly has

          17    small min - small variants, no bias and you

          18    calibrate it to census that, I know your

          19    colleagues are doing a terrific job in doing

          20    the interferential projections, but they are

          21    old, nine years old and what we do and that's

          22    what we do in practice, we calibrate it and

           1    we treat the Census numbers as being

           2    non-random.  No error on variables made, and

           3    is that correct or not and there's a lots of

           4    talks about it and one thing that I said why

           5    don't we do the next year when we have the

           6    census data go back and check our

           7    assumptions.  And I would suggest the same

           8    thing to you.  We do a lot of think--

           9              MR. HOUGH:  I think that's the best

          10    we've got.

          11              DR. FEDER:  Because we are dealing

          12    with reality and uncertainty in a complex

          13    statistical estimation that sometimes

          14    requires maybe some refinement.  But those

          15    questions are not only with your situation;

          16    we face them in our cases too.

          17              DR. HENGARTNER:  Isn't there going

          18    to be a problem with your suggestion that by

          19    going to next year's inventory or census,

          20    some companies may not exist anymore at that

          21    time?

          22              DR. FEDER:  But if you go back four

           1    years there is a greater problem, you have

           2    one either way.

           3              DR. HENGARTNER:  All right.

           4              DR. FEDER:  Yes.

           5              MR. HOUGH:  It's always an issue

           6    with the survey, the timing.  You're always

           7    drawing the sample problem, the data census

           8    that will be updated as we process our

           9    survey.

          10              DR. SITTER:  Do you have a public

          11    perception issue, is that one of the reasons

          12    that you're calibrating or is it not a matter

          13    to you, because I think that in some of the

          14    cases that Moshe is talking about it's

          15    probably a public perception issue.  That is

          16    there are some key variables and if you put

          17    out estimates that's different from the

          18    previous census, that is you put it out and

          19    they take your weights and calculate it and

          20    you are way off on some key demographic

          21    characteristics or something--

           2    into question.

           3              DR. FEDER:  Our published estimates

           4    are on drug use, mental health and things

           5    like that, so there's no issue there, but

           7              DR. FEDER:  But we have tried to as

           8    a quality measure to see, what if you go back

           9    and estimate.  In fact well, I cannot talk

          10    about specifics, but I've done some

          11    experiments and I didn't like the results and

          12    I talked about it, because, it has to do with

          13    I think with the state of the art of

          14    calibration which is still evolving, because,

          15    I remember actually again if I might digress

          16    a little bit, when I came to STATS Canada I

          17    was new to statistics and taking courses from

          18    Randy, I -- people were still doing

          19    regression type of calibration where negative

          20    weights were generated.

          21              We're talking about something which

          22    is quite recent, we're talking about

           1    mid-nineties and people said "Hey how can I",

           2    I mean you're worried about the weights

           3    smaller than one, people said "How can I have

           4    a negative weight?" and I remember a

           5    situation, we did some projection for certain

           6    region of Canada, where Dwight had turned up

           7    and we said, "you know you don't have to go

           8    down because of calibration", he said "no, no

           9    that's wrong", so people said "you know, you

          10    can do smaller estimation if you have

          11    negative weights because some small areas get

          12    negative estimates of total of a positive

          13    quantity", so then all my colleagues who were

          14    much more advanced in this topic than I was

          15    came up with wrecking ratio adjustments or

          16    what we call in Britain, SPREE and some other

          17    methods of doing calibration that guarantees

          18    positive weights.

          19              Then people were happy for a while,

          20    then they said, no, weight has to be greater

          21    than one.  Okay so I think and then you go to

          22    cross extreme weights and they had leverage

           1    on the various estimates, we are still moving

           3    statistician because I haven't been doing

           4    statistics for that long.  I see a lot of

           5    progress in that but it's still quite in

           6    evolution.

           7              DR. SITTER:  And more recently

           8    there's a empirical likelihood methods to

           9    guarantee positive weights, there is some

          10    rich aggression methods, there is quite a lot

          11    of work on this where you want these weight

          12    adjustments to have constraints.  I think

          13    there is some literature there but --, and I

          14    think that a lot of that literature is driven

          17              I think they are still at this

           4    studies?  I mean they were in sync, now that

           5    sync works, why don't we just keep it.

           7              MR. FRENCH:  And keep the census

           8    and MECS relative during the same year.

           9              MR. HOUGH:  We have to go back to

          10    the back there.

          11              MR. FRENCH:  I think we've already

          12    expanded the interval between the MECS year

          13    to the point where we are worried about

          14    relevance, so it's every 4 years now, and for

          15    it to be in sync with the census, it would be

          16    every 5 years --

          17              MR. HSEN:  And we don't have an

          18    annual manufacturing survey in the interim.

           6    like I said every time we do this survey,

           8    stratifying to a new control total, it's

           9    always going to be an option, the way the

          10    surveys are done and the way our surveys are

          11    done.  Next time we come across, we came up

          12    with this method for when we had the census

          13    this time, that's not going to happen for 20

          15              DR. FEDER:  But I think we are

          17    we should put it on the committee's agenda

          18    for next time because you could think about

          19    many ways maybe like a rolling survey where

          20    every one of those 4 years or 3 years you do

          21    part of the sample so you have a way to

          22    measure change, maybe a panel, a survey

           1    whenever a company is observed, maybe at

           2    least a couple of times we can measure change

           3    more effectively, I mean there is a lot of

           4    things so, maybe what we should do is put it

           5    on next meeting in April, I think it'll be

           6    and discuss not just the estimation issue but

           7    also the design issue.

           8              DR. SITTER:  How stable are things

           9    over the years?  Have you looked at patterns

          10    in terms of the relationships from census to

          11    your survey?  I mean in some sense having it

          12    badly coordinated with the census can give

          13    you sort or more data in a sense that you

          14    know, you -- if things are reasonably stable

          15    then you have some relationship between how

          16    things deteriorate from the census over time.

          17    I mean we are talking about long time windows

          18    here and I don't know your industry that well

          19    but did you have some data?

          20              MR. HOUGH:  Well the energy data is

          21    going to be correlated with the production so

          22    the industry has increase in revenue; we

           2    direction.  Over the past 4 years it's been

           3    going, it's been on a decline and that's the

           4    result that we've had this time.

           5              MR. COLE:  Is that quantity-based

           6    or is that value based?

           7              MR. HOUGH:  It has to be value

           8    based, that's what it is based on -- that's

           9    what the measure and size is based on values,

          10    that's all -- that's all we've got but then

          11    MECS collects quantity detail as well as,

          14    cycles are quite often quite a bit quicker

          15    than your census.

          16              MR. FRENCH:  And that doesn't get

          17    into the issue of the fact that MECS collects

          18    things like non-purchased fuels and other

          19    things that's used in very different places,

          12    about post stratification methodology -- hey.

          13              DR. FEDER:  With a very interesting

          14    description of a problem with the MECS

          15    surveys, say I've to look there, it's the

          16    Manufacturers Energy consumption Survey,

          17    which uses the economic census conducted

          18    every five years on business they did it

          19    October 7, to construct a calibration

          20    weights.  And in 2002, the two surveys

          21    occurred at the same time because the MECS is

          22    conducted now every four years, it used to be

           1    every three years since 1985, and 2002 was

           2    unique in the sense that every 20 years of

           3    the current design was to survey, as I said,

           4    the survey and the census coincides.

           5              So there was an opportunity also to

           6    use the economic census in calibrating the

           7    weight.  Now, the, what we heard is about an

           8    approach to, first of all, I should go

           9    through the steps of the weight adjustments

          10    and there are three of them.  First they do

          11    the non-response adjustments, which is a

          12    simpler simple ratio adjustment that to

          13    calibrate the weight to the census -- to the

          14    weight of census total energy consumption.

          15              The next step is a post

          16    stratification adjustment and that's followed

          17    by a coverage adjustment, because there's a

          18    typical, I guess with this kind of

          19    establishment as per new companies that are

          20    created, that are not covered by the survey.

          21    There's also some companies that transferring

          22    the manufacturing, which in the census says

           1    that is also a birth.  There's also death,

           2    but the deaths are caught by the center

           3    because when you, a survey or -- a company

           4    turns out to no longer be in business or not

           5    doing manufacturing that you can account for

           6    that.  So all those things lead to a coverage

           7    adjustment.

           8              And the goal of the study was to

           9    come up with a certain weight adjustment,

          10    that will have two features.  One, it will

          11    calibrate to the census total weight of

          12    consumption figures and also they wanted to

          13    guarantee that units that were self

          14    representing in the sense that their analytic

          15    weight was equal to one, their weight

          16    wouldn't change.  So what they proposed is a

          17    new weighted weight, which is actually, it's

          18    in your handout, it's equal to 1 plus K times

          19    the old weight minus 1.

          20              And if you look at the formula as

          21    to weight is equal to one, that the

          22    adjustment is one and the weight remains the

           1    same.  And there was some concern about the

           2    statistical property of those adjustments and

           3    what impact it will have on the standard

           4    errors.  Somebody mentioned that EIA

           5    publishes this every table, a scheduled table

           6    of standard errors and that also used in

           7    determine -- determination whether figures

           8    should be released or not based on quality

           9    and other consideration.  So the committee

          10    was asked a few questions related to that.

          11              And also another important question

          12    that was raised by the presenters was that

          13    2002, what happened here like this perfect

          14    storm of the two, two things happening at the

          15    same time, the survey and the census will not

          16    occur again for another 30 years, so what do

          17    you do, with the censile information is old

          18    like the next time MECS is going to be

          19    conducted is '06.  But the last census then

          20    would still be '02, so what do you do about

          21    that.

          22              And there were some other related

           1    questions and a lively discussion about what

           2    would happen here.  And if I may quote, one

           3    of the committee members said, the problem is

           4    actually hard and some of it is not clear and

           5    we were also asked, have you seen this method

           6    before, and the answer was not exactly like

           7    that.  It was mentioned that the calibration,

           8    the concern about calibrated weights being

           9    greater than one is actually quite common.

          10    It's done in most long surveys and are

          11    procedures to do it.

          12              So a committee member suggested to

          13    look at that and maybe use some other

          14    calibration method.  But the question still

          15    remain, how do you evaluate the current

          16    method.  There was some question whether

          17    there is or isn't a bias, and a simulation

          18    might help here, another suggestion that was

          19    made was to perhaps take the 100% of the

          20    sample, set aside, say 20% of it.  Use the

          21    80, treat them as if they were

          22    non-respondents, apply the method to the 80%

           1    and validate your prediction for those

           2    missing units using the new weights.  I wont

           3    go in to the mathematics but there were some

           4    issues that if units that have the weight

           5    close to one are different from the ones

           6    whose weights are far greater than one, then

           7    a bias would occur, so that's one way to

           8    check that.

           9              Let's see if, yes, there was some

          10    issue here about the -- about the weights,

          11    the randomness of the weights should be

          12    treated as error and variables issue which

          13    can lead to bias even asymptotically, as was

          14    pointed out and that's a hard problem and

          15    this was mentioned that in all practical

          16    applications, this is the problem and there's

          17    no clear solution to that.

          18              And there was some other discussion

          19    about using the ASM, which is independent of

          20    the survey in doing the weight adjustments

          21    and the calculation, it shouldn't be very

          22    hard because of the independence.  So that's

           5    being at the same time as the survey.  It was

           6    mentioned that they had the design issue and

           7    maybe the survey could redesigned, maybe

           8    having a part of the sample data in each

           9    year, rather than having it once every four

          10    years or so, what I am -- we were wondering,

           1    are asked to enter their information on fuel

           2    consumption, generation and stocks of fuels

           3    on every month.  And within -- I think within

           4    45 days of the end of the month they're

           5    supposed to enter the data and the -- while

           6    they're entering the data you want to give

           7    them comment, so to help them -- the idea is

           8    to help them enter the correct data.

           9              So that we can kind of cut down

          10    your edit work later on and so that you get

          11    the data in, person who is supplying the data

          12    give you as correct a data as possible, that

          13    is the overall objective.  This gives rise to

          14    a very complex database, because every plant

          15    has several types of prime movers and each

          16    prime mover has several types of fuels that

          17    it can consume and so on.  So we have to --

          18    they have to fill in a form like this with a

          19    lot of different units going down there and

          20    different fuels for each unit and so on.  So

          21    it gives rise to a very complex database.

          22              The current system I think, the

           1    current edit that is being applied right now

           2    is essentially data plant taking up data

           3    plant and compute the mean and standard

           4    deviation for that over a 24- month period.

           5    And compute an interval like mean plus or

           6    minus 1.5 standard deviation, and if the

           7    entered data is outside that, then flag it

           8    and invite them to correct the data points,

           9    and give them mild warning saying that the

          10    data you have entered is not correct or not

          11    in the range perhaps and so on.

          12              So one of the problems of this

          13    system is that you know, if you have

          14    autocorrelation in your data for example, you

          15    might miss it, or seasonality in the data you

          16    might miss it.  And of course you know, there

          17    are some modification and this is what I told

          18    you is the simplest form of the edit.  There

          19    are some, you know further checks on the --

          20    this system, this method to incorporate

          21    seasonality and so on but still it seems to

          22    me, you know, the autocorrelation part might

           1    be missed completely.

           2              So that's why the proposal on the

           3    -- in the paper right now is to look at

           4    something like, simple exponential smoothing,

           5    that we capture the autocorrelation.  And you

           6    know, help you pick up some outliers that you

           7    may not normally consider outliers.  So

           8    number of questions to the committee on this

           9    one is to -- I think the primary question is

          10    how to choose the best alpha.  That is one of

          11    them and alpha will be a smoothing parameter,

          12    or another -- another way of putting up the

          13    same question is that, are you happy with the

          14    alpha you chose?

          15              And also another aspect that I know

          16    whether you have a handout here, I think if

          17    you look at the picture, if you compute the

          18    smoothing parameter for every plant and make

          19    a histogram, that sort of looks like a

          20    bimodal thing like this for some of the

          21    parameters.  And why do we get lots of zero

          22    alphas and lots of 1 alphas and what does it

           1    mean and so on.

           2              In this case it so happens that if

           3    you have alpha that is very close to zero,

           4    then you're sort of back to the mean edit

           5    situation.  And if alpha very close to 1,

           6    that means that you don't trust the mean very

           7    much because you want to startup

           8    autocorrelation in the data.  So some of the

           9    -- some of the decision, I mean there was a

          10    lot of discussion, I think, in this case I

          11    think committee really acted like a

          12    committee.  I think we really did not have a

          13    solution for any of the bullets.  So we have

          14    a lot of suggestions today, and that's more

          15    like the all the, you know, all the non and

          16    in the PHD committee, all the non-chairs do

          17    that, right?  Chair is the only one who

          18    worries about getting it done.  So -- that is

          19    what we were acting like the other committee

          20    members.

          21              And so, the issue I think is that

          22    -- you know think overall we felt very

           1    comfortable with the proposal.  Because

           2    especially it picks up alpha and you know

           3    that it is really kind of an improvement on

           4    what you're doing right now.  You're not

           5    really completely throwing away what is being

           6    done and starting something new.  It is an

           7    improvement on what is being done right now,

           8    so it seems like it is something definitely

           9    that remains to be explored.  But one of the

          10    critical issue here is, we don't know who is

          11    right.

          12              You know, suppose you apply this

          13    old edit as well as the new edit and the old

          14    edit kicks this out and the new edit kicks, I

          15    mean does not kick it out, we don't know who

          16    is right, who is wrong.  That is one of the

          17    critical issues.  It may be worthwhile coming

          18    up with a data set that you may want to say,

          19    okay, we all agree that these are the correct

          20    values, now let us evaluate the different

          21    edit systems.  It may be a worthwhile

          22    exercise to spend sometime coming up with a

           1    "test database" where you feel comfortable in

           2    accepting some values as the correct values.

           3              Now, that is one of the things, and

           4    as far as estimating alpha right now as one

           5    of the heat I would say is that the smoothing

           6    parameters are estimated using SAS.  You

           7    know, I'm sure there are many softwares that

           8    can help you in that one but I think SAS is

           9    being used, but then again you know, it seems

          10    most of the simple things like kicking it out

          11    and kicking it in and things like that are

          12    probably done on a spreadsheet and you have

          13    to combine the SAS output with the

          14    spreadsheet, send it to somebody else and so

          15    on.

          16              So one of the suggestions might be

          17    to use a simple estimate that is -- can be

          18    done in like a one line for moving average

          19    smoothing parameter, we can write down a

          20    formula for you know, getting a decent

          21    estimate for the alpha, instead of using a

          22    sophisticated software.  So that is something

           1    that, if you do that, then your ability to

           2    manipulate lot of these things will probably

           3    go up.  The other suggestion was to consider

           4    a grid of alpha.

           5              Not just you know, if the estimated

           6    alpha is something, then simple estimate is

           7    some 0.3, then go down a few, go up a few or,

           8    you know, and see well how this, how many,

           9    what percentage of the flagging and so on.

          10    Yet another suggestion we got was, perhaps if

          11    you look at some of the plots there are too

          12    many large numbers, lots of zeros and large,

          13    you know, it's kind of a oscillating thing.

          14    So one might want to consider some

          15    transformation of the data, so that something

          16    that is not being buried somewhere, some are

          17    data points.  Then that is some of the

          18    information we got.

          19              But we ended up discussing a lot

          20    about, you know, how can we incorporate some

          21    of the other information that is available,

          22    like, the type of fuel for example.  Use of

           5    auxiliary information that can be used for

           6    edits and there were a lot of suggestions and

           7    I think fortunately we were -- we had both

           8    the people there, they seemed to be nodding

           9    and saying that maybe we can try that you

          10    know, we have no idea what we were saying

          11    right or wrong, but I think, when you can see

          12    them nodding, I said, okay, not too bad.

          16              For example, one of the slightly

          17    more complicated suggestion that came out

          18    was, for certain types of plants there is a

          19    special pattern that kind of goes on line and

          20    come -- goes to zero for a while, comes back

          21    on line for little bit and goes back to zero.

           2    trying to edit is of one of that type.  So

           3    you may want to build in a memory sort of, we

           6    so you just entered zero, is it, you know,

           7    supposed to be zero that, so some special

           9    suggestions on that one.

          10              So overall I think committee seems

          11    to be very excited with the project.  I mean

          12    it was lot of excitement and the, and I

          15    skirting.  That may not be that important an

          17              I think this specific bullet apart,

          18    whether should we consider mean absolute

          19    prediction error or mean square error?  I

          20    mean that may not be that critical in this

          21    case, I think there are lot of other issues

           3              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  Okay.  Thanks

           4    Nagaraj.  Are there comments or questions or

           5    corrections?

           6              DR. FEDER:  I wasn't at the meeting

           7    but I looked at the handout and I want to

           8    make a few comments.  Just that they're all

           9    focused on the time series adjustments.  One

          10    thing is said, if you look at the model, it

          11    assumes stationarity of this, no allowance

          12    for snow and there's a method by

          13    Holton-Winters which, I mean it convinces(?)

          14    it's in Howry's book on structural time

          15    series models, which is also very simple mind

          16    it, more than, very simple.  It just allows

          17    for a slope and there's another version, it

          18    also allows for seasonality which might be

          19    appropriate here.

          20              I would like to not have too many

          21    alphas but I would, because of their pattern

          22    that Nagaraj was talking about with some

           1    plants phasing in and phasing out to do

           2    production, maybe stratified by something and

           3    then just treat the ones that exhibit more

           4    regular pattern, perhaps with or without

           5    seasonality, I don't know enough about those

           6    plans to say one way or the other.

           7              And finally the selection of the

           8    alpha are we seeing as (?)IBEC in Canada had

           9    a forecasting issue when we also dealt with a

          10    very short time series.  Actually we ended up

          11    using something like a variant of the common

          12    filter but the way to do it, also with

          13    Holt-Winters by using a penalty function.  By

          14    that I mean to following.  You start with the

          15    series what you know and every -- for every

          16    time point you look at the Holt-Winters on,

          17    the exponential smoothing, best estimates for

          18    that time point, look at the difference,

          19    that's called the innovation between what you

          20    observed and what you predicted, you square

          21    it, you edit up, that's your penalty.

          22              Of course you look to minimize

           1    that, you want your prediction to be what you

           2    observe.  And the alpha that is best -- that

           3    minimizes that is your choice of alpha.  It's

           4    sort of an objective way of coming up with

           5    alpha which is very easy to program and we

           6    had the satisfactory results with that.

           7              But I think having too many alphas

           8    defeats the whole purpose, because it will

           9    tend to favor I think the last observation

          10    rather than a smooth estimate.  But certainly

          11    I think because of the nature of those time

          12    series, I would allow for a slope and for

          13    seasonality.

          14              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  The exponential,

          15    some of it is allowed for a local linear

          16    change, so it's --

          17              DR. FEDER:  Yeah that's -- that's

          18    just included in the Holt-Winters.  I mean --

          19    Holt- Winters is exponential -- or maybe I'm

          20    wrong about the terminology.

          21              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  Yeah, not on

           3    there was no allowance for that one --

           4              CHAIRMAN BREIDT:  What I mean is a

           5    stochastic change, a local linear change.

           6    Not a perimetric change.

           7              MS. KIRKENDALL:  It is adaptive,

           8    it's just -- if there is a real trend in the

           9    day, then it's not good enough.  But if it's

          10    just some changing over time -- then it --

          11              DR. FEDER:  Oh yeah.

          12              MS. KIRKENDALL:  It is a change.

          13    We haven't seen many trends in this area.  We

          14    see some seasonality in the data.

          15              DR. FEDER:  Okay.

          16              DR. HENGARTNER:  Explicitly more

          17    than the seasonality of them, smoothing the

          18    residuals using the exponential weighting

          19    might actually be a good idea.  Because to

          20    control better the variance, that way.

           2    some seasonal versions of the moving average

           4              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes, here I think

           5    we had a brief discussion about this and one

           6    of the things to remember is that, these

           7    edits on at a facility level, so you'd have

           8    to the seasonality on whatever structure that

           9    you're talking about, each facility

          10    separately.  And so this is not you know,

          11    like you're doing cross section across

          12    facilities.  So that just increases, you

          13    know, and that's an enormous preposition.

          14              DR. FEDER:  We'd have too many

          15    problems because we did with, but why can't

          16    you assume the same seasonality within the

          17    structure?

          18              DR. HENGARTNER:  Well, it is like

          18    yesterday, that's why I was not here.  West

          19    Virginia is a fairly affluent state, which --

           1    and they were having a conference and they

           2    asked for representation.  I did talk with

           3    him last night, he indicated that this

           4    meeting is so great.  So future meetings,

           5    hope we won't be able to talk about, but it's

           6    nice to be here with you.  But you know, as

           7    you know we're periodically reassessing how

           8    we can continue to fulfill our mission?

           9              And again it's a tough place to be

          10    King or Crown Prince or whatever role we play

          11    here because, you know, we do have this

          13    lots of technical skills combine the needs in

          14    the areas of expertise, it is a growing you

          16    the world economy and the energy

          17    environments.  I think that -- try and look

          18    at this years blow out in the oil markets

          19    where I think really demand, well,

          20    particularly Asia that was not anticipated I

          21    think by anybody and the data available was

          22    quite poor.

           1              There's a lot of concern about the

           2    quality of international data in this area.

           3    There's a joint oil data initiative underway

           4    to try to improve it.  So there was lot of

           5    pressure to improve the quality of data.

           6    There is unrelenting demand for product

           7    promos, service reports, data and model

           8    improvements.  I guess, yesterday you heard a

           9    lot about the STEO, the regionalization of

          10    the Short Term Energy Outlook, there's a lot

          11    of interest in that.  There's a lot of

          12    interest in natural gas data, we are planning

          13    a new natural gas production survey.  And

          14    then so what, rising demand and then a pretty

          15    tough budget situation, which I'll elaborate

          16    on a little bit.  EIA has been doing a lot of

          17    -- for in some sense we've been doing it on

          18    an unsustainable basis, in that we've been

          19    living beyond, we've been spending more than

          20    our current budget in each of the last couple

          21    of fiscal years.

          22              That's been done by reducing what

           2    So money from earlier years that was carried

           3    over, that we were spending, but if you look

           4    at how we've been delivering our program,

           5    we've actually been spending a fair amount

           6    more than we're budgeted on, on a yearly

           7    basis.  That how we can continue, roughly 60%

           8    of our budget supports staffing and staff

           9    related costs and increases in those areas

          10    are driven by Congressional action on pay.

          11              Certainly we have a well-qualified

          12    staff and we want them to be well paid.  But

          13    in the environment where last couple of years

          14    that has been, maybe what, 4% each year, in

          15    that area and I don't know where they will

          16    come out this year, it's one of the last

          17    things they'll do.  It will probably 3% I'm

          18    hearing, 3 or 3.5%.  But this cost of

          19    pressure in that area and it's also a very

          20    tough budget environment.

          21              EIA can try to swim upstream in

          22    that tough budget environment, because we're

           1    a very small fish, so that's a good news I

           2    guess.  If we were a big piece of the

           3    domestic discretionary budget, it would be

           4    very hard to be going in a different

           5    direction then that whole overall budget and

           6    that is a strategy that the administrator and

           7    I are trying to pursue and I think that, at

           8    least in the administrations budget proposal

           9    for this fiscal year that started this month,

          10    without a budget yet.

          11              The administration only has

          12    proposed a pretty substantial increase for

          13    us, for about $81.1 million to $85 million,

          14    which for us is a good increase.  Congress

          15    has not acted on it, but there's no guarantee

          16    that that success, the administration would

          17    propose significant budget increases for EIA

          18    in 3-4 years.  That Congress would provide

          19    the money, we're in a tough league here,

          20    we're in the interior budget.

          21              So you know we're competing with

          22    smoking the bear and keeping national parks

           2    in the West, and all kinds of, you know,

           3    other programs that are important too.  So we

           4    think EIA's important, obviously other

           5    programs have other constituencies, I think

           6    they're important.  So we always need to

           7    think about how to deal with, you know, best

           8    employing the resources that we have, how to

           9    make trade offs between products if we have

          10    to do that.

          11              How to balance, you know, meeting

          12    immediate needs and requests of today with

          13    still being our capability to meet tomorrows,

          14    our questions, how to deal with the

          15    turnovers, some of our personnel, they're

          16    interested in, there are just a lot of

          17    questions.  How to deal with domestic versus

          18    international data?  How to deal with the

          19    split between surveys and analyses.  How to

          20    prioritize from other surveys?  If indeed we

          21    run into trouble, how to choose between

          22    changes and periodicity and sampling

           1    strategies that might save some resources

           2    versus perhaps terminating some surveys.  And

           3    we have in the 2005 budget, even with the

           4    increase from $81.1 to $85 million, proposed

           5    to terminate one survey in the electricity

           6    area.

           7              Again there's always an issue about

           8    how to deal with these questions.  And we're

           9    dealing with them on an everyday basis,

          10    sometimes we get tunnel vision, there's a

          11    real advantage in bringing folks in from the

          12    outside who might have some ideas in these

          13    areas.  So I just like to rally throw it

          14    open, there are lot of challenges before us

          15    in running what I think is, a pretty good

          16    program at EIA or a very good program at EIA.

          17    But we do have challenges and if you were the

          18    king or queen or crown prince, or whatever it

          19    is, what would you be thinking about, are

          20    some of these questions?

          21              And we can break it up into the

          22    technical expertise area, so how to trade off

           2    savings, which are always welcome.  I think

           3    our staff and you always like to talk, yeah,

           4    I think it is about cognizance and a sense of

           5    frontier that you try to get to, we're

           6    trading off cost on the one hand and then you

           7    have quality and timeliness, which are the,

           8    you know, very important dimensions for EIA

           9    and I think we in EIA naturally always tend

          10    to think about ways to improve quality,

          11    improve timeliness, well, the discussion

          12    around, this program is about that.

          13              We also need to think potentially

          14    about ways to save money, holding quality and

          15    timeliness constant.  It's not as much fun

          16    for out staff or maybe for you to think in

          17    those terms, but again if you have ideas in

          18    those area, it will be very helpful.

          19              MR. BLAIR:  You just touched on

          20    staff and I think that obviously the issues

          21    of quality and timeliness are important, but

          22    I think staff frustration, staff burden, how

           3    something that you want to factor into the

           4    equation.  I know, few meetings ago, there

           5    was a big discussion on the issues of

           6    recruiting and maintenance and losing senior

           7    managers and so forth.  So I've -- I just

           8    recommend that it should not get lost in the

           9    equation.

          10              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Yeah, it is

          11    interesting.  We have done some, that's

          12    right, we have been very interested and over

          13    the past year have introduced some new ways

          14    of recruiting staff.  We used it for our

          15    entry level, each office as they needed

          16    people would put out an individual

          17    announcement, which then had to be cleared

          18    through the departments personnel system.

          19    And there was a very high cost for each

          20    announcement.

          21              Even though we realized pretty

          22    early on that, at the entry levels which is

           1    out of, either out of under graduate or just

           2    out of gradate school levels, we really

           3    weren't looking for people who had, it didn't

           4    matter so much if you're going it pretty well

           5    in gas activity, you just have to have a lot

           6    of oil and gas expertise.  As along as you

           7    went through with the activity, you didn't

           8    really need to have a lot of, look through

           9    the expertise in those levels.

          10              We're really looking for, you know,

          11    we'll teach you the field expertise, we

          12    really want the best math staffs, the best

          13    survey staffs, the best operations research

          14    analysts, the best economists.  So we went to

          15    a EIA wide recruiting at those levels,

          16    although again at the higher levels, we're

          17    still recruiting office by office with

          18    individual announcement.

          19              I think we had a fair degree of

          20    success with some of that recruiting, we

          21    managed to bring some good people and I think

          22    we're going to try that approach again, we've

           8    a lot of pretty good people.  So we're able

           9    to recruit, which is good.

          10              We don't have some of the

           4              MS. KHANNA:  I wanted to say or

           5    what should be done -- but I don't know

           6    without making any difference in the cost of

           7    doing it in-house versus doing outside, but

           8    one of the problems you see with a contractor

           9    is, you have no control over what's happening

          10    within the contracting agency.  For example,

          11    if I was working with Abt consultant and you

          12    know I worked in a particular project and

          13    then 6 months later, Abt gets the same

          14    continuation of the project, it maybe

          15    somebody else.

          16              And you have no control over the

          17    composition of the team that actually does

          18    the work, whereas if you do it in-house, not

          19    only are you keeping the skills, especially

          20    determined, you're trying to recruit and

          21    build up the skill levels of the younger

          22    staff members.  You know, there's a long term

           1    payback in doing it in house whereas it maybe

           2    a short term payback in doing it through a

           3    contract, and maybe that's something you may

           4    want to think about when you take that

           5    decision.

           7              DR. BURTON:  It's getting close to

           8    the -- the advantages that come with

           9    contracting are more pronounced when there's

          10    a great deal of variability in project

          11    natures and in workload.  When you have a

          12    very consistent set of tasks, that you're

          13    doing through time, the advantages of

          14    contracting out are not nearly as big and

          15    it's my sense that most of what happens here

          16    happens with a little very predictable

          17    regularity so that that probably the

          18    advantage is that a lot of front seat

          19    contracting wouldn't be -- wouldn't

          20    necessarily be realized in this specific

          21    setting.  That's kind of what I have.

          22              MR. BLAIR:  There are some ways to

           1    control for that and I know that has given

           2    some projects with different contractors is a

           3    problem, you know, but keep moving staff

           4    around and shifting up from one project to

           5    another, but I -- I think there's some

           6    contractual ways of dealing, it is with some

           7    of that.  The other perspective that I would

           8    take on it and this is very similar to a

           9    perspective we take on you know, we

          10    subcontract out something as opposed to doing

          11    it ourselves.

          12              Again goes back to sort of, what is

          13    it you're trying to develop internally as

          14    skills, what competencies are you trying to

          15    maintain when you contract out.  Is it

          16    something that, you know is an area that you

          17    know, you're not trying to build in

          18    internally, by means of a particular project

          19    normally, but I think in the back of your

          20    mind it should be, you know you're

          21    contracting out something that you should be

          22    building the capability for internally.

           1              DR. FEDER:  Howard, to your

           2    question, if I were king, I would still be a

           3    member of this committee, but I want to quote

           4    one of my colleagues from Australia, David

           5    Steele.  He said that, "If you have poor data

           6    then the best estimation method is still not

           7    going to get you very much but if you have

           8    good data, even decent estimation will be --

           9    will give you almost as good."  What that

          10    tells me is that if I were king and I had to

          11    decide where to --

          12              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  You're going to

          13    the priority question?

          14              DR. FEDER:  Yes, I would say look

          15    at your data, first of all use of

          16    administrative, already available data is of

          17    course the cheapest and sometimes the most

          18    efficient way and anything that can be done

          19    there should be -- but the -- we talked today

          20    about some issues on some surveys that led us

          21    to think that maybe design issues should be

          22    looked at.  And for myself, I'm actually more

           2    data when it's already been collected.  It's

           3    sometimes used after the data had been

           4    collected and it's already done.  And it

           5    drives me sometimes crazy when I look at it,

           6    when I see that certain data, the

           7    questionnaire had been changed, you cannot

           8    even look at consistency because trends are

           9    sometimes much more important than levels.

          10              There is a lot of interest now to

          11    know why we see a spike in -- hopefully it's

          12    a peak, which is going to come down, but you

          13    know, cost avoidance so and so, you raise the

          14    issue of international data in it's quality

          15    and I think maybe there are some sources and

          16    some kind of relationships that EIA can build

          17    with other organizations in other countries

          18    to help there.

          19              And I would put my emphasis or best

          20    part of my effort in improving data quality

          21    prior to data analysis, just because, and of

          22    course the simulation is important because it

           3    data on this and I'm saying it although

           4    personally I'd like to do data analysis, but

           5    that's my viewpoint.

           6              DR. SITTER:  Now, I think that on

           7    that issue, I probably as king would be more

           8    inclined to cut surveys than quality as a

           9    general rule.  It has two basic advantages.

          10    The worst thing you can do is deteriorate on

          11    average overall.  Secondly you know, when you

          12    state your budgets, you state your budget

          13    requests on, well okay, under this budget we

          14    can do this, otherwise we can't.  I mean --

          15              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Well, that's what

          16    we tried to do.

          17              DR. SITTER:  That's all you can do.

          18              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  I think this is

          19    something that really -- I really started and

          20    I -- were in the budget request it spells

          21    out, at this level we drop in this survey,

          22    we've not done that before.  Because I think

           1    that, you know that, every, lot of agencies

           2    and a lot of people are been in there, sort

           3    of a streamlining process for a long time

           4    now.  And I mean maybe early on that the

           5    solution is different.  Because I think that,

           6    you know, you come from fat times to lean

           7    times, areas start to trim, I mean you can

           8    become more efficient, you can decrease costs

           9    and it's a good thing.  But my feel has been

          10    over my time in this committee that you

          11    passed that.

          12              There's a lot of fact determined in

          13    terms of we could do things quicker, faster,

          14    more efficiently, decrease cost, and it

          15    doesn't seem to really be there.  And the

          16    budget you're talking about doesn't, you

          17    know, say, well we're going to have to have

          18    to drop a position or something, these are

          19    millions of dollar changes, right.  When they

          20    drop your budget, they drop you by enough

          21    that may cost the entire, an entire survey

          22    easily.  So now that's my consensus.

           3              MR. BLAIR:  Kind of to second

           4    Randy's comment in that, it also maybe less

           5    disruptive internally in a sense if you, you

           6    know, just have to cut out a piece of you

           7    know, as hard as that is, rather than trying

           8    to tinker with a whole bunch of things, this

           9    is in terms of how well you can do it, that

          10    might also be done with that.

          11              DR. BURTON:  I know, I'm probably

          12    preaching to the choir but I was talking with

          13    one of the staff yesterday and I mean a lot

          14    of the reason I think the EIA has been able

          15    to do as much as it is done, as well as it is

          16    done it, with a actual decline in real

          17    dollars, so over the last decade it is

          18    because of we increased productivity this

          19    largely, attributable to technology and

          20    communications.  Those opportunities for

          21    productivity I think have been fully taken

          22    advantage of, the ability to ring anymore out

           1    in terms of additional productivity, my guess

           3    this but I'll tell it to anybody else you'd

           4    like me to.  So I think if you're going to go

           5    forward and keep doing what you're doing,

           6    much less do anything additional, if you got

           7    anymore resources.

           8              DR. HENGARTNER:  I mean, my

           9    comments come from discussions we've had

          10    yesterday and it is I think a fact that many

          11    of your surveys, survey the same companies

          12    for different purposes.  And there is maybe a

          13    little bit in efficiency of being able to

          14    say, I just kind of pin each company once a

          15    year or once a month, so whatever the

          16    frequency is that we need to, I get all the

          17    information on both oil and electricity and

          18    whatever else we're asking.

          19              Now the problem with that is that

          20    this is going to require lots of money to

          21    change the e, and the equation is, is it

          22    worth the energy in the long term to do that

          17    I'm ---- that it dropped four months of that

          18    survey.  I mean DLS dropped four months of

           1    good suggestion but I think it largely

           2    assumes that there is a certain amount of

           3    coordination going on in the company side,

           4    because you might have a survey --

           5              DR. BURTON:  That's a different

           6    form.

           7              DR. NEERCHAL:  Yeah, once I was

           8    dealing with, you know, second floor and the

           9    other one in the fourth floor, and they don't

          10    talk to each other then it's probably not

          11    going to be much of a use coordinating from

          12    one side.  I wanted to mention a couple of

          13    things about the recruiting.  One of the

          14    things I feel that you can really help in

          15    your recruiting is to let the younger people

          16    like graduate students and the younger people

          17    who know the kind of work that is going on in

          18    EIA.  So it'll be -- I think this has been,

          19    this idea has been thrown around in this

          20    committee before, if the project sponsor a

          21    session in ASA perhaps with the EIA work, the

          22    kind of statistical work that is going on

           1    here.

           2              So that you really let the

           3    students, the graduating students know that

           4    there is an interesting work going on in the

           5    agency and some things are, you know, that

           6    doesn't have to be in the ASA.  It could be

           7    some of the smaller satellite conferences, or

           8    even in the modeling area there might be some

           9    conferences, where, which is suitable.  So

          10    you really kind of showcase your work and

          11    with plenty of interesting things going on

          12    here and that is one of the attraction for

          13    the students when they graduate, go ahead to

          14    work in.  They do have lot of choices now and

          15    statistics really is selling.

          16              DR. SITTER:  Well, on the

          17    recruiting issue.  So here's a question, are

          18    you having trouble recruiting still?  I think

          19    last time it just came up, the economy was

          20    blooming right.  So I know that at least all

          21    the students I know seemed to have as many

          22    choices as they wish.  We had master

           1    students, master students from Vancouver,

           2    turned down flights to the East Coast because

           3    they just can't travel that much for

           4    interview.  So it's not the case, that you

           5    are having trouble.

           6              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  I always think

           7    about, the troubles that I focus on are

           8    always the internal ones of moving paper

           9    through the department systems.  It -- my

          10    sense is that we're getting some pretty good

          11    applicants.

          12              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes, I think we've

          13    been getting pretty good applicants.

          14              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  And so far we

          15    think we are all right.

          16              DR. SITTER:  Because I have --

          17              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  If you're giving

          18    us a heads up, that's the environment is --

          19              DR. SITTER:  It's not changing.

          20              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Not changing.

          21              DR. SITTER:  So that just means you

           1    think that there are still lots of jobs and

           2    the students have lots of choices.  It just

           4    choice now --

           5              DR. HENGARTNER:  There's always a

           6    problem that you require US Citizenship.

           7              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes.

           8              DR. HENGARTNER:  And if you look

           9    at, the school of graduate students, half of

          10    them are out.

          11              MS. KHANNA:  More than half of

          12    them.

          13              DR. SITTER:  Yeah, that -- that's a

          15              DR. HENGARTNER:  That is a problem.

          17              DR. HENGARTNER:  And if that could

          19    that would help a lot.

           1    interesting because that's what changed here

           2    in the last year is that now even our

           3    contractors have to be US citizens, well, uh.

           4              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Yes, complicated

           5    there.  Certainly an issue that we're looking

           6    at, very hard, there's officially --

           7              SPEAKER:  Some conflicting items

           8    right there, I would say but access of

           9    foreign nationals to certain systems, you

          10    know, in headquarters, it's a problem and in

          11    our case if you can't have access to our

          12    systems what're you going to do.

          13              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  So it's almost,

          14    it's not that foreign nationals are ruled out

          15    as contractors, but it's just access to

          16    systems issue.

          17              DR. NEERCHAL:  Of course, the top

          18    of the line is the airport security, you need

          19    that.

          20              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  So there are --

          21    that is the challenge.  You know, both --

          22    there are challenges in the contractor area

           1    as well.  It hasn't gone to the point of an

           2    absolute bar, but it's a problem.  --- 3b

           3              MR. BLAIR:  I'd like to reinforce

           4    the point that Moshe made about having the

           5    data versus sort of what you can devote to

           6    analysis and to give that is not just your

           7    analysis of course but it's the analysis of

           8    other users and that having the data out

           9    there, you know is important to them.

          10              But I think more broadly yesterday

          11    in a lot of the different parts of

          12    discussions we had, we were I think as

          13    committee saying, we think, you know, this is

          14    I guess primarily with an OMB directive and

          15    that's saying like, you know, you guys, you

          16    know do a good job now and you aren't

          17    appreciated sort of for what you're doing

          18    though, you know, hopefully that's not in all

          19    quarter and that most of you are appreciated

          20    and that you have a reputation for excellence

          21    and when it comes to having to make choices,

          22    I still kind of go with sort of Randy's

           1    approach, it's better to cut out a survey

           2    however painful that maybe and whatever

           3    constituency that might affect than to tinker

           4    here and there.  If you start to have a

           5    reputation for sliding in terms of quality

           6    and in terms of excellence, that takes a long

           7    long time to recuperate from.

           8              So, if I'm, you know, looking at

           9    choices and also trying to keep in mind the

          10    long-term, I think that things, you know, are

          11    very hard to reverse once they start to --

          12    once they start to slide.

          13              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I think over the

          14    last ten years a lot of those changes in

          15    sample sizes is to get a lower precision.

          16    Those have already been done.  So we are much

          17    lower than we've got now, you don't know if I

          18    have anything much left.

          19              MR. BLAIR:  Yeah, if you're not to

          20    the point of diminishing returns you're

          21    awfully close to.

           1              MR. WOOD:  Just on the diminishing

           2    returns, you know, you casually said there

           3    might be some efficiencies in going to a

           4    company to get all the EIA data.  Many of the

           5    companies, let's say Exxon Mobil have many

           6    times the size of EIA and vastly many times

           7    the size of the budget.  There would be some

           8    efficiency, if you were going to run an oil

           9    survey and a big oil production survey and a

          10    gas production survey, that would be

          11    efficient to go to the production accounting

          12    department, but if you were going to go to

          13    Exxon Mobil for all the types of information

          14    that EIA actually surveys, you would add, I

          15    would say significant cost and an efficiency

          16    to do so because you know they have this

          17    diverse interest on most of all the interior

          18    department and all the department of energy,

          19    etcetera.  So there are limited areas where

          20    you could still potentially gain something,

          21    or just a blanket go to Exxon and ask them

          22    all the questions that you want to know is

          17    for example some of your surveys are now used

          18    in derivative products; I mean make them

          19    hurt, so --

           5    procedures and some of the things that we've

           6    done that, you know make our work more

          11    maybe we should analyze this more, well then

          12    you have, you know, less efficiency in the

          13    group, you know you take one system that was

          14    producing that survey and others, you say,

          15    no, this only has to be done separately, so

          16    the number of people who has access to it has

          17    to be reduced to the minimum, well then, you

          18    know, yes, it's become more important,

          19    professionally those changes are making it

          20    more costly for us and we have to do more to

           3              These are all things that we have

           4    never worried about.  I mean -- you guys are

           6    NAS, and over to the Department of

          18    out surveys every week, that you say now

          19    these derivatives are startling and all but

          20    almost that it's worked the other way, you

          21    know, have it, the fact that is, that these

           3    little bit of efficiency to improve security.

           4              So at least in the short term it's

           6    additional resources.  So, it's interesting

           1    related question, do you -- I think there was

           2    a session -- related session, couple of

           3    meetings ago, do you have a fairly good

           4    understanding of who they uses for each

           5    survey is and I think you know, you might

           6    give a power ranking on each of them -- each

           7    of your user, so you know where to push the

           8    button if you ever need to -- I think, I also

           9    agree, I think that you need to, people will

          10    know how an important survey is when it is

          11    gone, like we have been complaining about the

          12    BLS survey, and you see it is gone, you know

          13    how important it was.  So once in a while you

          14    just let people now, what it feels like if

          15    you're not there.

          16              So, it maybe an important thing for

          17    you to know, who the customers are for each

          18    survey and you know, who are the important

          19    players in each group.

          20              MS. KIRKENDALL:  We have spotty

          21    data on that, for some offices they have been

          22    very good in keeping tabs on who is using

           1    their data profiles and other offices haven't

           2    paid too much attention.  Dwight French's

           3    office survey, energy consumption survey, has

           4    always done a good job knowing who the users

           5    are.  The outside users, the outside federal

           6    users especially.

           7              MS. KHANNA:  Well, I think we are

           8    all saying this ma'am, I'm just going to

           9    restate.  One of the things that we want to

          10    keep in mind is what are the goals of the

          11    exercise?  Is it really -- this is our budget

          12    for this year and we have to live with it and

          13    so then we trim or is this our budget

          14    projections for next year and there is chance

          15    to actually getting an increase and then we

          16    cut where it hurts, you know because the -- I

          17    mean your strategy is going to depend on the

          18    goal and so I think we need to first -- each

          19    time actually define the goal before we

          20    decide what to do.

          21              DR. BURTON:  Howard, there is

           1    about this in the past, I can't recall for

           2    sure.  I mean certainly you all develop

           3    products that people would pay for and is

           4    there an opportunity to develop revenues

           5    through those products.  I like being able to

           9              DR. HENGARTNER:  No, no but you

          10    have to be careful, user fees from the

          11    private sector pay and the government pays

           9    particular products or whole surveys, or

          10    you're doing tinkering inside to try to make

          11    adjustments and that is visibility, don't do

          12    these things without the outside world kind

          13    of being aware of what's going on and what's

          14    in the pipeline, particularly it's, you know,

          15    you're making small changes inside, nobody

          16    sees that, nobody cares you know as long as

          17    they are getting so.

          18              But if you've got things in the

           9              DR. FEDER:  Sorry, again summing

          10    from my Canadian experience, when provinces

          11    need -- province specific estimates or they

          12    want more position to augment a simple size,

          13    setting a province or some transfer of

          14    funding from the province, I don't know if --

          15              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Yes, we've had

          16    some of that, I think we had working with

          17    certain States --

          18              MR. FRENCH:  We've mostly worked

          19    with other federal agencies to do things to

          20    add questions on surveys and do things

          21    generally.  Now with our consumption survey

           1    surveys to try to have the capability of

           2    going down the smaller geographic areas, so

           3    if there's somebody who does want to pay for

           4    something to supplemental survey for a

           5    particular area, we're more capable of doing

           6    that, but we thought a few years ago that

           7    that might be a distinct possibility as there

           8    was some States that maybe interested in

           9    doing that.  But I think States feel squeezed

          10    and we're not hearing that the same way as we

          11    were a few years ago.  Well, we can still do

          12    our re-designs to try to provide as much

          13    capability for that as possible, if somebody

          14    comes out of his work.

          15              MR. WOOD:  By the way, maybe 15

          16    years ago at an ASA meeting, we had as a

          17    topic, kind of the value of publicly

          18    available data and it was one of the MIT

          19    professors and it was just a brilliant

          20    presentation, but the fundamental conclusion

          21    was the same as we already heard this

          22    morning, that if you've got some important

           3    the rest of the world.

           4              That is, it loses it's monetary

          11    it's a million dollars a year.  And the

           2    don't go all the way and start really

           3    delicate.  An agency that has the mechanism

           4    in fact to sell it, I think this might be

           5    pushing the envelop you know if you had a

           6    subscription survey but that's the way huge

           7    numbers of consulting firms are actually

           8    doing.

           9              Many of them are in that secondary

          10    market and every single slide in a million

          11    dollar customer oriented cost survey and EIA

          12    is that data collector and often the analyses

          18              DR. SITTER:  I think that this

          20    is willing to pay and so forth really tides

           1    was discussed yesterday.  One of the main

           2    ideas about what you do well and don't do

           3    well when presenting is, you know, who is

           4    using your data and the other thing is how

           5    much do they value your data and I think that

           6    if your going to go through the exercise

           7    anyway, it might be a good idea to you know

           8    have some of your big customers, take a look

           9    at you and talk this things over with them as

          10    part of your OMG thing and maybe they'll tell

          11    you that they really value your data and when

          12    you start talking about well we've really got

          13    problems, maybe they will be some help for

          14    you there both in your OMG evaluation and at

          15    the same you'll get some input, maybe you're

          16    wrong, maybe they don't value your data that

          17    much.  Good to know.

          18              MR. BLAIR:  I like that idea a lot

          19    and I think if there was some way to make it

          20    part of the process in the sense that almost

          21    -- like you know, part of an advisory board

          22    or whatever that, you know would comment and

           2    process that they're talking about in terms

           3    of improving the agency's effectiveness, that

           4    there could be, you know, depending on how

          10    criterion I think we do reach out, but I

          11    think there are a lot of good ideas here,

          12    some of which would have significant

          13    implementation problems, but others I think

          14    that we could pursue, and it's really

          15    appreciated.  Guy, do you have any?

          10    There's an agenda item on committee

          14              Yeah, see the public as we make

           1    do that -- what I would like to say is that I

           2    was struck by how willing and cooperative and

           3    collegial this group was and how interested

           4    the group was in trying to do better and also

           5    how hard this group works.  I come out of a

           6    couple of different communities, I've spend a

           7    lot of time in the Department of Defense and

           8    a lot of time in industry, IBM being one of

           9    the places and so I wanted to say that this

          10    sort of willingness to work through things I

          11    think it's very positive and that there are a

          12    number of communities that have some of those

          13    same interest and that by talking you can

          14    find ways to go forward.  So that's what I

          15    think.

           3    say thank you as well, so.  First I wanted to

           4    thank the members of the committee for

           5    agreeing to participate in the committee and

           6    being very robust and flexible and dealing

           7    with all of the different kinds of problems

           8    we've dealt with over the years.  It's really

           9    been a privilege to work with such a talented

          10    and diverse group, I've learned a lot, I

          11    don't normally interact with econometricians

          12    and survey methodologist, my normal herd is

          13    math-stat type people but it's nice to get

          14    out and meet new people, so that's been a

          15    pleasure.

          16              It's also really been a pleasure to

          17    work with EIA.  I didn't really know anything

          18    about the agency before serving on this

          19    committee but I learned a lot about it and I

          20    now feel this allegiance that Nancy and Randy

          21    were talking about yesterday, so.  In the six

           1    talked about many many different kinds of

           2    problems but almost every time it was not a

           3    question of how do we do this but how do we

           4    do this better and it's just an obvious

           5    dedication to quality throughout this agency

           6    that's really impressive and a pleasure to

           7    work with.

           8              So, I would like to thank the

          10    interact with committee but they all slipped

          11    off right when -- but you know there's many

          12    many people that regularly interact and it's

          13    -- we see them again and again and get to

          14    know them, which is nice and then of course I

          15    want to thank Nancy for all her work and Bill

          16    in particular for all the logistical support,

          17    handling everything making this Chairmanship

          18    job very easy, so.  So, then it's been real

          19    pleasure, thanks very much and we're

          20    adjourned.

          22                   PROCEEDINGS were adjourned.)
