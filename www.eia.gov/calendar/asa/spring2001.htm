</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  <strong>Spring, 2001 Meeting of the</strong>
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
<strong>ASA Committee on Energy Statistics</strong>
</CENTER>
<P>1. General Session: Introductory remarks from the Acting Administrator: L.A. 
Pettis; and The Status of the EIA-sponsored ASA Fellowship: Nancy Kirkendall, 
Statistics and Methods Group 
<P>These opening remarks to the Committee neither sought nor received 
recommendations. 
<P>2. General Session: <U>Progress Briefing on the International (MARKAL) Model 
Development</U>: Mary Hutzler, Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting. 
<P>This briefing to the Committee neither sought nor received recommendations. 
<P>3. General Session: <U>Update and Results of Cognitive Testing of EIA 
Graphics</U>: Herb Miller, Statistics and Methods Group; with coauthors Colleen 
Blessing, National Energy Information Center, and Howard Bradsher-Fredrick, 
Antoinette Martin, Renee Miller and Robert Rutchik, Statistics and Methods 
Group. 
<P>Abstract: Update on results since the November 2000 meeting; progress, next 
steps and questions to the Committee. 
<P>Committee Reactions: The Committee thought the cognitive approach to testing 
EIA graphs was good and agreed with all of the conclusions and recommendations 
that were presented. A suggestion was made to include an explanation of the 
process in the write-up of the results. A reference to "Cognitive Aspects of 
Designing Statistical Maps," conducted by the National Center for Health 
Statistics was also provided as background information. We received an excellent 
presentation from Nicolas Hengartner on "What are Good Graphs?" Deficiencies in 
some of EIA's graphs were also presented - i.e., titles can be too wordy. Advice 
was also given on dual y-axis graphs, i.e. try to ensure that the lines do not 
cross. The advantages of multiple bar graphs compared to stacked bar charts was 
also presented. 
<P>EIA Response: The EIA team will incorporate committee recommendations and 
will next discuss how to get the recommendations implemented throughout EIA. 
<P>4. General Session: <U>Out One Door and In the Other - Knowledge Sharing In a 
Period of Transition</U> : John Weiner, Colleen Blessing and Renee Miller, EIA's 
Quality Council. 
<P>Abstract: Anticipating the imminent retirement of a significant number of 
long-time EIA employees and the arrival of a new generation of EIA staff, the 
EIA Quality Council established a series of knowledge and experience sharing 
activities. This presentation was a report to the Committee on the status of 
these activities and a request for comments and suggestions on other activities 
that have worked well in their organizations. 
<P>Committee Reactions: Generally, the ASA Committee agreed with the need to 
address knowledge-sharing issues, and how EIA proposes to do so. Major comments: 
(1) EIA should pay special attention to good documentation and up-to-date files, 
which are any organization's insurance policy, (2) As the senior generation 
retires, EIA might use the opportunity to consider strategies to pass authority 
to younger employees, (3) "EIA 101" courses should be mandatory, and their scope 
and frequency should be expanded, (4) successful recruitment requires much 
closer contact with top candidates throughout the application process. 
<P>EIA Response: The team will take all the ASA recommendations back to the EIA 
Quality Council. 
<P>5. Break-out session: <U>EIA Interagency Project: Disclosure Auditing 
System</U>: Mark Schipper , Office of Energy Markets and End Use. 
<P>Abstract: EIA, jointly with six other federal statistical agencies and the 
interagency Confidentiality and Data Access Committee, has been developing 
disclosure auditing software. To protect the confidentiality of survey 
respondents, statistical agencies, suppress table cells that might reveal 
individual/company data. While agencies sometimes use sophisticated suppression 
software, most software does not provide an evaluation of its suppression 
pattern. Auditing - estimating the minimum and maximum values for each 
suppressed table cell - provides information for such an evaluation. This was 
the third discussion with the committee about the audit project and included a 
demonstration of the beta version of the Disclosure Auditing System (DAS). 
<P>Committee Reaction: Although time was limited due to the lengthy 
demonstration, one of the Committee members related that the Benford 
distribution was discovered by the American astronomer Simon Newcomb in 1881 who 
noticed that the first pages of books of logarithms were soiled much more than 
the remaining pages. In 1938, Frank Benford arrived at same formula (below) 
after a comprehensive investigation of listings of data covering a variety of 
natural phenomena. In general, "…if the numbers under investigation are not 
entirely random but somehow socially or naturally related, then the distribution 
of the first digit is not uniform. More accurately, digit D appears as the first 
digit with the frequency proportional to log10(1 + 1/D)." 
<P>EIA Response: This was a follow-on presentation near the end of the software 
development project. This was primarily an update. Concerning the interesting 
item noted above, the software does not currently make use of a distributional 
assumption for the rounded values. 
<P>6. Break-out session: <U>How to Develop "Emergency" Surveys: Suggestions for 
"Cutting Corners"</U>. Beth Campbell, Office of Oil and Gas; Stan Freedman, 
Statistics and Methods Group. 
<P>Abstract: The focus of this session was on survey design methodology not 
particular surveys. The Committee was asked to suggest ways EIA should do things 
differently to move from "quick and dirty" to something better Examples were 
drawn from EIA experience with the EIA-911. 
<P>Committee Reaction: For short lead time surveys, the Committee emphasized the 
importance of early focus on the analysis objectives before designing the data 
collection approach. The Committee proposed that emergency surveys were probably 
not a miniature of other survey efforts - i.e., something that was done as 
business-as-usual but faster or with some cutting of corners. They advised 
thinking about the management effort in a different way. They particularly 
thought it might be useful to look for parallel work in different areas, to 
prioritize the work by complexity of problems, and to use formats that would be 
familiar to respondents. Finally, they suggested that EIA prepare an 
"after-action" summary of their efforts on emergency surveys and take it to 
specialists in short turnaround surveys in the private sector or other agencies 
to ask for advice. In this way it would be possible to develop a record and 
assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of emergency surveys which could be 
shared in the future with originators of similar requests. They felt EIA should 
be prepared to go back to originators to discuss and amend the request based on 
the assessments of these emergency surveys. 
<P>EIA Response: EIA will prepare an "after-action" summary, and will give 
serious consideration to asking for advice from other experienced parties. 
<P>7. Break-out session: <U>Monte Carlo Analysis of Uncertainty in Greenhouse 
Gas Emission Estimates</U>, Perry M. Lindstrom and Souad A. Benromdhane, Office 
of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting. 
<P>Abstract: In response to "best practices" guidelines under development by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a "Tier 2" procedure for 
uncertainty analysis is applied using Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo 
techniques are used to combine probability distribution functions (PDFs) for 
various sources of energy-related greenhouse gas emission data. The advantage of 
the Monte Carlo approach over the "Tier 1" procedure (the square root of the sum 
of the squares) is that it allows for the combination of normal and skewed PDFs 
that reflect as realistically as possible the nature of the various parameters. 
This is the first phase of the work which will eventually encompass all the 
major greenhouse gases. <STRONG>(</STRONG>This is further follow-up from the 
previous 2 meetings.) 
<P>Committee Reactions: The committee pointed out that presenting the range 
observed in simulation (minimum and maximum values) is not an appropriate 
measure as these values will go to infinity as the number of iterations go to 
infinity. They suggested that an interval in terms of percentiles(e.g. from 2.5 
to 97.5 percent) be presented instead. Also, the committee felt that a normal 
distribution was probably the best assumption to use for all the Probability 
Density Functions (PDFs) and that it was not necessary to recreate the exact 
distribution from the original data at the level of aggregation at which this 
analysis is being performed. Therefore, they suggested abandoning the use of the 
uniform distribution. Finally, the committee urged that the work consider 
dependence across sectors and across time. 
<P>EIA Response: The results will be presented using an interval in terms of 
percentiles in the final paper. Where possible the simulations will be run using 
normal distributions in the place of uniform distributions. If time and 
resources permit we will consider dependence among variables. This later point 
may be limited by the choice of software that is being used for the study. 
<P>8. General Session: <U>Analysis of Strategies for Reducing Multiple Emissions 
from Power Plants</U>: Scott Sitzer, Office of Integrated Analysis and 
Forecasting. 
<P>Abstract: At the request of the House Government Reform Committee, EIA 
analyzed various strategies for reducing power plant emissions of sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, and mercury. The Committee also 
requested an analysis of the impact on these emissions of a Renewable Portfolio 
Standard (RPS). The first part of the study, released at the end of 2000, 
analyzed the costs to consumers and the industry of reductions in 
SO<SUB>2</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The second part of the study 
will be released this spring. 
<P>The analysis examined a number of cases specified by the Committee, including 
cases that required reductions of each emission separately, plus integrated 
cases. The targets specified for SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB> were 75 
percent below their 1997 levels, with a compliance date of either 2005 or 2008; 
for CO<SUB>2</SUB>, the target was a level of emissions equivalent to 1990 
levels by either 2005 or 2008; and 7 percent below 1990 levels by the period 
2008-2012, similar to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. 
<P>The general findings were that an integrated approach would result in lower 
costs than a "piecemeal" approach; that reduction requirements for 
SO<SUB>2</SUB> and/or NO<SUB>x</SUB> would have little impact on electricity 
prices; that reductions in CO<SUB>2</SUB> would have much more impact on prices, 
either alone or as part of an integrated strategy; and that the costs of 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction requirements would dominate in an integrated case 
assuming SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions as well. There is also 
considerable uncertainty about the ability of the electricity and natural gas 
industries to meet such requirements by the earlier 2005 target date. 
<P>This briefing to the Committee neither sought nor received recommendations. 
<P>9. Break-out Session: <U>Verifying an Electricity Model;</U> Douglas Hale, 
Statistics and Methods Group. 
<P>Abstract: This paper presents the preliminary results of a project to compare 
the prices calculated by an optimal power flow representation of the 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland power area with market data. The paper 
relates the correspondence of actual and calculated results to the quality of 
publicly available data, especially cost data. The work is underway and there is 
real risk that the correspondence may be poor. 
<P>Committee Reaction: The committee suggested that EIA look at whether capacity 
withholding from 11AM until about 4PM would improve the fit of calculated to 
actual prices. 
<P>EIA Response: The committee's recommendation will be taken. 
<P>10. Break-out Session: <U>Frequently Asked Questions About Survey Response 
Rates</U>: Ruey-Pyng Lu and Nancy Kirkendall. 
<P>Abstract: In this session we will discuss survey response rates in light of a 
project currently undertaken by EIA staff in support of OMB's statistical policy 
branch. The purpose is to provide agencies and OMB personnel who approve surveys 
with information about response rates: how to compute them, how to decide 
whether response rates are acceptable, how to encourage response, and how and 
when to assess whether there is nonresponse bias. The resulting paper will be 
part of an OMB product entitled "Frequently Asked Statistical Questions". 
<P>Committee Reaction: The Committee thought that the survey response rate 
project is a challenging task. They did not like the regression model that was 
used in the original FASQ to estimate response rates because it can project a 
response rate greater than 100%. They agreed that it is important to get a 
sufficiently high response rate, and recommended that our guidance should 
include ways to make sure that in low response cases data can be used to support 
analysis. In particular, we should discuss:<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>investigating the differences between respondents and nonrespondents; 
  perhaps by comparing late respondents with on-time respondents, or selecting a 
  sample of nonrespondents for extensive follow-up efforts; or evaluating the 
  patterns of response for various subgroups (e.g. large companies versus small 
  for economic surveys, or by race or gender for demographic surveys.) 
  <LI>discuss the relationship between response rate and projected use of the 
  data. There are cost implications to striving for a high response rate -- when 
  is it important and when is it less important? There was some thought that 
  response rates do not have to be as high if the data will be used as input to 
  modeling as they do if the estimated parameters will be used directly in 
  policymaking. 
  <LI>identify strategies for contacting hard-to-reach populations. 
</LI></OL> 
The committee provided some articles addressing these issues. 
<P>EIA Response: EIA will incorporate these ideas in a revised draft of the FASQ 
on response rates and give the committee an opportunity to review itin the 
future. 
<P>11. Break-out Session: <U>How Does EIA Measure the Impact of its Data?</U> 
Howard Magnas. 
<P>Abstract: EIA's current mission statement says: "EIA is a leader in providing 
high quality, policy-independent energy information to meet the requirements of 
Government, industry, and the public in a manner that promotes sound 
policymaking, efficient markets, and public understanding." Currently EIA uses 
as a measure of "sound policymaking" the number of information products for 
Federal policymakers per year (including briefings, testimony, reports); as a 
measure of "efficient markets" it uses the total number of web site visits in a 
year; and as a measure of "public understanding" it uses the number of media 
citations of EIA data in a year. 
<P>But measuring our impact on markets is difficult. As a next step towards 
this, we asked economist Edward Leamer to consider the approaches for evaluating 
the impact our Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) forecasts have on markets. His 
paper will provide a springboard for other approaches to this admittedly 
difficult problem. 
<P>Committee Reaction: Participants discussed EIA's ongoing collection of 
performance measures (web hits, media citations of EIA data and Congressional 
and Policy briefings) and utilizing user surveys to measure impact of EIA data. 
The committee suggested that we add citations in academic and research work to 
the two media measures which we currently track. They also asked if we could 
track data references, where researchers are using our data and performing their 
own forecasts and analysis. ASA also suggested developing a list of important 
customers including others that produce energy forecasts, the association of 
energy economists, etc. They offered to help in the development of such a list. 
Individuals on this list could be contacted to get input on the use of our 
products, and their importance to users. One of EIA's customers was present as 
an observer and also offered to help in this effort. 
<P>EIA discussed the high cost of user surveys and EIA's projected budget cut 
for 2002. ASA suggested using conjoint analysis to developing a ranking for 
products that are being considered for elimination -- this would provide user 
input to the development of budget decrements when budgets become tight. A 
discussion emerged on the relative value and importance of EIA data projects 
compared to analysis and modeling work. ASA participants felt that EIA analysis 
and modeling projects were of less importance than EIA data; private modeling 
firms use EIA data in their models and these private modeling firm's models were 
used more extensively than EIA's. 
<P>It was suggested that we collect data to see whether futures prices move when 
EIA comes out with surprising data. This may be a long-shot, but it is also low 
cost. A committee member pointed out that USDA produces crop forecasts, and they 
do see futures prices move. 
<P>EIA Response: EIA will work to obtain citations in academic and research 
papers and references to use of EIA data in forecasts and analysis. We plan to 
develop a list of important customers and review it with committee members. We 
will then plan on an approach to solicit information from these customers 
concerning the use and importance of EIA products. The suggestion to examining 
the relationship between EIA releases and futures prices will be shared with 
other EIA offices. 
<P>12. General Session:<U>Measures of Data Quality for EIA Surveys:</U> Tom 
Broene, Statistics and Methods Group 
<P>Abstract: EIA conducts surveys of many different populations, and our 
knowledge of the quality of our data has varied from one survey to another. We 
have not prepared a full quality profile for many years, and are looking at 
alternatives that are easier for us to produce and for our users to digest. In 
order to obtain better and more uniform indicators of the quality of our data, 
we are seeking to implement a minimum standard set of measures for data quality. 
This paper reviews recent literature, past work within the agency, similar work 
elsewhere, and our recommended set of measures. We are particularly interested 
in the Committee's opinions on whether we are missing key items. 
<P>Committee Reactions: 
<P>The two ASA Committee discussants pointed out several items needing 
clarification or refinement. Both discussants thought that our summary of work 
elsewhere was thorough, and that our recommended quantitative measures were a 
good start. But they suggested more direct measures for several areas including 
frames, imputation, edits, and measurement error and agreed that having and 
using a checklist for survey managers to record whether, when and how often 
specific activities are conducted would be useful. 
<P>The question of whether or not to release information to the public was 
formally presented with a list or pro's and con's. Many useful suggestions were 
received from the committee, including displaying item response rates as a 
histogram across items, and limiting our measures to a few key items from each 
survey. 
<P>One committee member voiced the opinion that a composite quality index would 
not be a good idea. 
<P>EIA Response: EIA will proceed to implement selected performance measures in 
their newly revised computer survey systems, and will pursue the development of 
a checklist to be used by survey managers. We will also consider alternative 
ways of presenting the performance information. The opinion about a composite 
quality index may help us in evaluating future requests for this type of index. 
<P>General Session: <U>Invited Paper Session at the Joint Statistical 
Meetings</U>. Carol Gotway Crawford, ASA Energy Committee. 
<P>Abstract: Every year ASA Committees are allowed to request an Invited Paper 
Session at the Joint Statistical Meetings This year requests must be received by 
ASA in the June, 2001. The requests are all reviewed by the Committee on 
Meetings (this year, in August, 2001), and the winners are selected. Winners 
then have an invited paper session at the next Joint Statistical Meetings 
(August 2002). 
<P>This is an opportunity for the Committee to contribute ideas and potentially 
to participate. We are looking for perhaps 4 issues of interest to EIA -- with 2 
EIA people and 2 Committee people to make presentations at the August 2002 
Meeting. EIA is inviting a Committee discussion to stimulate this dialogue and 
see that this happens. 
<P>This discussion was not advisory in nature. 
<P>14. Break-Out Session: <U>Electricity 2002: New Data Forms and New 
Confidentiality Policy</U>. Dean Fennell, Office of Coal, Nuclear, Electricity 
and Alternative Fuels. 
<P>Abstract: EIA has been conducting an analysis of its electricity data 
collection forms for the past two years to determine what information should be 
collected in light of the changing structure of the industry. To accomplish 
that, EIA established the Electricity 2002 Project, which the ASA was briefed on 
at its last meeting. The purpose of this presentation is to summarize the 
proposed changes to the data collection forms and the proposed new data 
confidentiality policy. Both of these proposals were released to the public for 
their comment the week of March 12, 2001 in the Federal Register. EIA plans to 
submit its final proposals to the Office of Management and Budget in the fall. 
<P>Committee Reaction: The committee thought that the approach used by the 
Electric Power Division (EPD) in developing data requirements and adopting new 
confidentiality policy was appropriate. The committee suggested that a 
memorandum of understanding between EIA and State Public Utility Commissions 
might be one way by which confidential data could be shared. They also proposed 
that the EPD use a systematic approach for soliciting comments about 
confidentiality in addition the voluntary comments received from the <U>Federal 
Register</U> process. The systematic approach would require a mandatory response 
to a separate survey, which would require the approval from the Office of 
Management and Budget OMB. 
<P>EIA Response: The EPD looked into developing memoranda of understanding with 
the Public Utility Commissions a few years ago and learned that Federal agencies 
can only have formal agreements concerning the sharing of confidential data with 
other national government entities. EIA needs to send the Electric Power forms 
to OMB for clearance soon if data are to be collected beginning in January 2001. 
The timing constraints make the separate systematic survey approach to 
soliciting input concerning confidentiality untenable for the current forms. 
However, the committee's advice will be considered in the future.
