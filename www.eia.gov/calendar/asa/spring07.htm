<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><b>1.  <u>Modeling Regional Electricity Generation</u></b>,
  Phillip Tseng, SMG, EIA</p>
<p class=Default style='text-align:justify'>In recent years, natural gas use in
  the electric power sector has been on the rise. As a result, impacts of power
  generation from natural gas plants on the very tight
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    U.S.</st1:country-region>
  natural gas market are
  becoming more pronounced. The ability to predict gas plant dispatching
  decisions can help analysts understand natural gas market conditions and the
  direction of price changes. Theoretically, dispatching decisions should be
  based on variable costs. However, considerations such as costs and accessibility
  of transmission lines, transmission and distribution losses, long-term
  contracts, distance to load centers, availability of fuels, ability to quickly
  ramp up or down generation, and cost and efficiency of available technologies,
  all play very important roles in power dispatching. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>This paper has two objectives: 1.
  Present a model built on historical generation, capacity, and sales data to
  predict monthly dispatching of coal and natural gas power plants. 2.
  Demonstrate that the same modeling framework can be used to simulate the
  effects of capacity loss in a sub-region on regional generation patterns and
  trade flow. Preliminary model results show that the model can produce good
  projections. However, the model can be further improved to capture fuel
  switching for dual fired oil- gas generators.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>One of the key comments from the
  committee is the use of bin numbers.&nbsp; Several committee members suggested
  that EIA use the utilization rates directly to create cumulative distribution
  functions as proxy for coal, gas, diesel, and residual fuel supply curves.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>EIA will try the approach and
  test the results.&nbsp; Previously, EIA had used the CDF approach but did not
  get good results.&nbsp; We will implement the suggested method and compare the
  results from both approaches.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><b>2.  <u>Petroleum
  Imports Data</u></b>, Howard Bradsher-Fredrick, SMG, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>EIA is presently investigating
  Customs/Census Bureau petroleum imports data as a data source or as a means for
  providing a mechanism for cross checking EIA petroleum imports data.  EIA presently collects petroleum imports data
  on its survey form EIA-814, “Monthly Imports Report.”  In order to do so, EIA directly surveys the
  actual importers of petroleum products, typically large oil companies.  Significant resources are expended in
  conducting this survey.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The Customs Service collects
  duties on imports in accordance with current policies and laws.  In so doing, the Customs Service collects
  detailed data on each importation transaction.  These transactions are made public to subscribers through the Census
  Bureau on a monthly basis with company-level identifying information
  removed.  </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>This preliminary work has
  involved determining to what extent EIA data are quantitatively comparable on a
  monthly basis with the data provided by the Customs Service.  It has also involved determining the
  comparability of EIA and Customs Service petroleum product definitions and
  geographical coverage.  While it has been
  discovered that quantitative, definitional and geographical coverage
  differences exist for some or all products, Customs data could still prove
  somewhat useful to EIA.      </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The presentation concerned itself
  with comparing EIA monthly petroleum imports data with similar data collected
  by the U.S. Customs Service.  The
  presentation showed that the definitions used by the two sources were quite
  different in many cases, the data reported were also usually quite different
  and issues of geographical coverage, timing, etc. could also be significantly
  different.  The primary question posed to
  the committee was how the Customs data should be best used by EIA, but EIA is
  also interested in any general advice the committee might have.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The committee members recommended
  that EIA interview respondents (to the EIA-814 Form) to discover if, and why,
  they are reporting different data to EIA than they do to the Customs Service.
  They also recommended that EIA meet with the Census/Customs staff members and
  discuss petroleum product definitions to determine if some of these differences
  in definitions can be reconciled. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>EIA (with participants from OOG
  and SMG) have already arranged a meeting with experts at the Census Bureau to
  discuss petroleum product classification issues.  SMG will also discuss the issue of
  interviewing EIA-814 respondents with OOG staff members to determine if this is
  a useful project to undertake. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><b>3.  <u>Modeling Ethanol and Other Fuels</u></b>, Anthony Radich, OAIF, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>EIA’s Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting has changed the way
  that liquid fuels are accounted for and reported in the Annual Energy
  Outlook.&nbsp; Petroleum products are now more accurately called “liquid
  fuels”, reflecting the potential displacement of petroleum-derived liquids by
  liquids from coal, natural gas, corn, vegetable oil, and cellulosic
  biomass.&nbsp; EIA has also changed its accounting for energy use in ethanol
  and biodiesel production processes.&nbsp; Corn and vegetable oil are now part
  of total biomass use, since coal and natural gas used to produce liquid fuels
  are counted as coal and natural gas use.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations and EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Committee recommendations are
  being reviewed to determine and EIA’s intended response is forthcoming.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><strong>4.</strong>  <b><u>Electricity 2008:  </u></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><b>(A)  <u>Clearance of Electricity Surveys</u>, </b>Robert Schnapp, Director,
  Electric Power Division, CNEAF, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>Electricity 2008 is a project to assess and revise the
  Energy Information Administration electric industry surveys to more accurately
  collect and disseminate information about the electric power industry.  The American Statistical Association has been
  briefed at prior ASA meetings on the issues that Electricity 2008 would be
  addressing.  This presentation will
  describe the two major efforts to merger six surveys into two.  The first would merge the existing Form
  EIA-906 “Power Plant Report,” Form EIA-920, “Combined Heat and Power Plant
  Report,” and Form EIA-423, “Monthly Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric
  Plants,” as well as transferring operational information from the Form EIA-767,
  “Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Report,” to the proposed new Form
  EIA-923 “Power Plant Operations Report.”  It would also have companies currently reporting on the FERC Form-423, “Monthly
  Report of Cost and Quality of Fuel for Electric Plants,” report cost and
  quality of fuel information on Form EIA-923.  The second effort would transfer the static information collected on
  Form EIA-767, “Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Report,” to the Form
  EIA-860, “Annual Electric Generator Report.”</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span class="style3"><b>ASA Committee
  Recommendations</b> and <b>EIA Intended
    Response(s):</b></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>This session was an overview to
  inform the committee of EIA’s progress in this area. &nbsp;No summary of
  committee advice or statement of EIA’s intentions is required. &nbsp;</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><b>(B)</b>  <b><u>Forms
  Design and Data Collection</u></b>, Bob Rutchik, SMG, EIA</p>
<p>This presentation had two purposes. Bob Rutchik first went
  into detail on how EIA combined the four electric power surveys – EIA-423,
  EIA-906, EIA-920, and the EIA-767 into the Form EIA-923. Bob then illustrated
  and asked the Committee’s advice on some of the problems that arose in testing
  and notifying electric power plants from combining the four surveys. Specifically, </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>Whether
    EIA should do a cognitive or a field test?</li>
  <li>What
    is the best sampling design to conduct a cognitive or field test with
    limited time to get the most valid and reliable results?</li>
  <li>What
    is the best strategy to notify respondents about the Form EIA-923?</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter problem is particularly crucial. Currently, one
  plant receives up to three surveys. That means there are three different
  respondents or contacts in a plant. With the Form EIA-923, one survey will be
  sent to a plant, or more specifically one contact. This person will need to get
  the different schedules to the right people/departments to complete it. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span class="style4"><b>ASA Committee
  Recommendations</b> and <b>EIA Intended
    Response(s):</b></span></p>
<p>The Committee provided EIA with advice in all these areas,
  advice which EIA is currently or will be implementing. The committee advised
  EIA to conduct a combination field and cognitive test. EIA will send the Form
  EIA-923 to respondents and ask them to complete it and then analyze the
  data.  That is the field test part. After
  that, it will debrief respondents about their answers. That is the cognitive
  part.</p>
<p>The Committee added that part of the testing should be on
  how the plants distributed, or not distributed, the survey among various
  departments to complete it. The Committee also recommended that a stratified
  sampling scheme was a “sensible” way to conduct the test. </p>
<p>Further, since the survey will eventually be an Internet
  Data Collection the Committee said usability testing “is the issue.” </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><strong>5. </strong> <b><u>National
  Institute for Statistical Science: Project Descriptions</u>,</b> Ruey-Pyng Lu,
  SMG, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>The Energy Information
  Administration (EIA) has established an Applied Methodology Student Research
  Program to be conducted jointly with the National Institute of Statistical
  Sciences (NISS). This program is designed to engage students in graduate
  programs in collaborative, interdisciplinary research on topics of interest to
  EIA. Research projects undertaken by students and their technical mentors at
  their home universities and their research sponsors at EIA will advance
  methodology and address specific research questions that are important to EIA
  programs. Students may apply either for full-time summer support or for
  research support during the academic year as either a full or partial stipend
  or as a cooperative arrangement that would provide research access to sensitive
  microdata. Ordinarily academic year research will be conducted at the student’s
  university; summer research may be conducted either on-site at EIA or at the
  student’s university with visits to EIA as necessary to consult with the EIA
  project sponsor and to access and utilize EIA data, as required by the
  particular project. Graduate students in statistical science disciplines
  (statistics, operations research, economics, etc) together with their faculty
  mentors are encouraged to identify a research area proposed by EIA and to
  define research objectives in conjunction with EIA staff preparatory to
  submitting a full proposal. Awards are made based on the strength of the
  applications. These are renewable based on accomplishments and approved future
  plans. Citizenship is not required; women and members of minority groups are
  especially encouraged to apply. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>We are in the process of
  developing specific project statements, in the hope of encouraging students to
  work on specific projects of use to EIA. We know it is important to provide
  enough detail so the researcher will have an idea as to the methodology and to
  data and its availability. So far we have developed draft descriptions of four
  research projects.</p>
<p><em><b>ASA Committee
  Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p>EIA could develop a couple of different types of grants that
  people could apply for. One which would be a shorter term, smaller-scale
  project versus a year-long fellowship in which they could apply. Be more
  explicit in terms of your project description about the dates and the terms of
  the contract, EIA could provide more information at your website;  Look at the EPA Star fellowship website, it’s
  a good template to use. Also, EIA may want relationship with the instructor,
  not with the student. </p>
<p>The Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex systems (MITACS), and the National Program on Complex Data Structures (NPCDS) training initiative has a joint project with Statistics Canada to grant internship to students working on the identified specific projects, and this could be another reference for EIA to develop Applied Methodology Research program.</p>
<p><em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>
<ol>
  <li> EIA has reviewed other programs and is considering using
    the EPA Star fellowship program as a model to enhance the EIA-NISS Applied
    Methodology Research program.<br>
  </li>
  <li>EIA may develop a couple of different types of grants for
  which researchers could apply; this could also serve as a recruiting tool.</li>
</ol>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><strong>6. </strong> <b><u>Allocating
  Municipal Solid Waste to Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy</u></b><u>,</u> Marie LaRiviere, CNEAF, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Municipal solid waste (MSW) has
  widely been viewed as composed principally of biomass.  Therefore, EIA and many other sources have
  historically classified it as a renewable energy source.  However, because MSW is composed of both
  biogenic (renewable) and non-biogenic (non-renewable) material, some members of
  the energy community have expressed concern that EIA has been incorrectly
  classifying all energy produced from MSW as renewable.  To answer these concerns, EIA has estimated
  the shares of MSW, both by weight and heat content, derived from renewable and
  non-renewable materials by year from 1989-2005. The methodology used to
  calculate the split is documented in this report.  </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In general, combustible
  non-renewable materials (e.g., plastics) are characterized by higher heat
  contents per unit weight than combustible renewable materials (e.g., paper
  products).  Thus, the ratio of renewable
  to non-renewable material volumes can have a considerable effect on the heat
  content of the waste stream.  Analysis of
  the calculated split showed the heat content per unit of weight of the waste
  stream has been steadily increasing over time.  This change can likely be attributed to the changing composition of the
  MSW stream, as increasingly more plastics are being discarded at the same time
  that decreasing amounts of paper and paper products are entering the waste
  stream.  </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>EIA will split MSW into renewable
  and non-renewable components for its future data releases, and the renewable
  and nonrenewable components of MSW will be reflected in restatements of prior
  data back to 2001.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Compare the plant average reported MSW heat content
    to EPA’s national average to get an idea of recycling trends, which could
  then be used in the forecast.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Expand survey to obtain (at the plant level) the
    mixture of MSW that is being combusted.</li>
</ol>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>
<ol>
  <li>The paper for this year has already been published,
    but it may be possible to integrate some sort of aggregated recycling
    trend into the model used when the next EPA report comes out in 2008. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The overall percentage of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
      w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    electricity created by
    combusting MSW is very small, so EIA cannot justify increasing the survey
    burden to these respondents for such an minute amount of production.  Also, plant design makes it difficult
    for the operators of the plants to know exactly what is being
    combusted.  At best, they can give
    us tonnage in, electricity out and average heat content of MSW that was
  combusted. </li>

  of Different Methods of Computing Yearly Growth Rates For Petroleum Supply, 1995-2004</u></strong><b>, </b>Carol Blumberg, PD, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'>This paper is part of a bigger project to compare the
  congruence of the monthly petroleum product supply values (in thousands of
  barrels per day) for finished motor gasoline supplied, distillate fuel oil
  supplied, and total products supplied as reported in various publications of
  the Petroleum Division of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) for the
  years 1995 to 2004. The focus of this paper is to compare 15 methods of using
  the data from these publications when year-to-year growth rates are computed by
  dividing the estimated average quantity per day for a month in a particular
  year by an estimate for that same month in the previous year. The monthly-based
  estimates used in computing these growth rates come from <i>Petroleum Supply
    Monthly </i>(<i>PSM) </i>and <i>Petroleum Supply Annual </i>(<i>PSA</i>).
  Weekly-based estimates, from data reported in <i>Weekly Petroleum Status Report
    (WPSR)</i>, are used three different ways to compute monthly estimates. These
  five different estimates of monthly product supply are then used in various
  combinations to form the ratios that estimate the year-to-year growth rates.
  The reason that comparing growth rates based on weekly data, monthly data as
  reported in <i>PSM</i>, and monthly data as reported in <i>PSA </i>is important
  is that weekly-based estimates for a month are available much sooner than the
  others. The weekly-based estimates are available within 11 days of the end of
  the month while the <i>PSM </i>numbers take up to 60 days to be released and
  the <i>PSA </i>data take about 6 months after the end of the calendar year to
  be released. Since the weekly-based estimates are based on samples and the <i>PSM </i>and <i>PSA </i>measurements are based on censuses, the <i>PSM </i>and <i>PSA </i>data are generally more accurate. The <i>PSA </i>numbers contain revisions
  of the data published in the <i>PSM </i>due to late submissions or
  resubmissions. So, the question of main interest here is whether growth rates
  using weekly-based estimates or <i>PSM </i>numbers can mirror closely the
  growth rates computed using the PSA numbers.</p>

  Researcher Access to EIA Microdata</u></b>, Jacob Bournazian, SMG, EIA</p>
<p>This break-out session was on evaluating alternative methods
  for expanding researcher access to energy microdata.  One option discussed was to enter into an

  Center.   A second option was to grant researcher
  access through some type of secure remote access facility.  This would be through a new program offered
  by the

  Center that is used or
  considered for use by smaller statistical agencies.  A third option was to sponsor a research
  program, such as the National Institute for Statistical Science Researcher
  Program, where researchers work on-site in the Forrestal building on
  pre-approved research projects.    The
  presentation discussed these three options for expanding researcher access to
  EIA microdata and solicited feedback from the committee members on the agency’s
  best approach for expanding researcher access. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p>The committee members recommended pursuing the researcher
  program through the National Institute for Statistical Science and also
  pursuing either of the other two options to expand researcher access to
  micro-level data.   EIA would need to
  provide consultative services to researchers to explain how to use the
  files.  EIA should consider developing
  synthetic data sets for researchers to access so they can become familiar with
  the file structure and variables.  Researchers should replace the synthetic data with actual company data
  level after the researcher’s computer programs are working properly.   Another consideration is that often, a
  researcher desires to merge the requested data with other data sets.  The discussants’ preference was to host EIA
  microdata at research data centers where other data series would be available
  and there is technical support for working with the files and merging EIA data
  with other outside data series.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>EIA Intended Response(s):</b></em></p>
<p><u>EIA’s Responses</u>.  EIA will pursue a research program that allows access to microlevel data
  with the National Institute for Statistical Science.  It will consider agency resources for
  expanding access at a research data center or granting researcher access to
  microlevel data through some type of remote access arrangement. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><strong>9. </strong> <b><u>Update:  NEMS Forecast Evaluation Methodology</u></b>, George
  Lady, Consultant to SMG, EIA</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The NEMS forecast evaluation
  methodology is intended to measure the differences between NEMS’ forecasts of
  energy production and consumption; and given this, to partition the differences
  found among the important, contributory influences, e.g., weather, product
  prices, and the level of economic activity. There are basically three methods
  that may be used for this purpose:</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Method #1: Archive the versions
  of NEMS used to make forecasts. When the time comes, re-run NEMS substituting
  actual with assumed values for important assumptions. Configure the runs to
  isolate the impact of important influences.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Method #2: When forecasts are
  made initially, design and implement a roster of NEMS solutions designed to
  isolate the influence of important assumptions. Pool the solution data and
  summarize the model output through regression analyses of the implicit,
  embodied market supply and demand for energy products. When the time comes, use
  the regression equations, or other derivations based on the solution data, to
  isolate the impact on the forecast value of differences between assumed and
  actual values for the important assumptions.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Method #3: The same as Method #2,
  except limiting the solution set used to the NEMS scenarios prepared for the
  Annual Energy Outlook.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Initial results of using Method
  #3 were presented to the ASA on October 6, 2006. At that time the committee
  approved of the goals of the evaluation method and proposed approach.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>For the update, presented April
  20, 2007, results based on both Method #2 and Method #3 were presented. Special
  runs were made by OIAF staff to isolate the weather effects in the AEO2007
  version of NEMS. Over 70 NEMS solutions were made available to the project that
  isolated the effects on energy demand of energy product prices, based upon the
  AEO2006 version of NEMS. The results presented to the Committee included the
  weather and price sensitivities from these runs as well as regression results
  based upon data pooled with these solutions. Method #2 was proposed to the
  committee as a practical way to isolate the impact of explanatory variables
  when comparing forecasts with the eventual, historical data.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>ASA Committee Recommendations:</b></em></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Written comments provided by
  Committee members before the presentation identified Method #1 as the best way
  to undertake the impact analysis. Nevertheless, this recommendation recognized
  the substantial, practical difficulties of archiving, and then reestablishing,
  computer environments and associated software, potentially decades after they
  were current. Given this, the regression approach was accepted as an
  acceptable, practical alternative.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In the discussion following the
  presentation, Committee members agreed with the purposes of the evaluation method
  and accepted the regression approach, based upon specialized NEMS solutions, as
  the best practical method for conducting the forecast evaluation. Concern was
  expressed over the experimental design used to configure the NEMS solutions to
  be used. The runs presented to the Committee were based upon the variation of a
  single assumption compared to a reference case. Other methods, involving
  multivariate changes in assumptions were identified and recommended for
  consideration.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><em><b>Intended EIA Response(s):</b></em></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>SMG has a project underway to
  continue to develop and implement the evaluation of NEMS forecasts. One of the
  project tasks is to assimilate selected NEMS modules, those projecting the
  demand for energy products by the residential, commercial, industrial, and
  transportation sectors, and be able to run the modules with respect to selected
  variations in important input assumptions. Following the advice of the ASA
  Committee, the literature on designing solution sets for the purpose of impact
  analysis will be reviewed and; subject to project resource limitations, a
  multi-variate design will be formulated and implemented. The solution data
  generated by this process will then be pooled and submitted to a regression
  analysis. The impact of assumptions on forecasts differences will then be
  assessed using the regression results.</p>
