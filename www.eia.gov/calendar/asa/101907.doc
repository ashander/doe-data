\par 
\par           7    and William Watson.
\par 
\par           8              MR. HOLTBERG:  All right, good
\par 
\par           9    morning.  The Annual Energy Outlook is one of
\par 
\par          10    only four hard copy publications which is
\par 
\par          11    still published by EIA.  And to understand
\par 
\par          12    the process that leads the release of the
\par 
\par          13    AEO, what I tend to do is review the quality
\par 
\par          14    control process that we go through for the
\par 
\par          15    AEO.
\par 
\par          16              Now since the AEO is a major EIA
\par 
\par          17    publication, it involves one of the most
\par 
\par          18    complete quality control processes of any of
\par 
\par          19    the EIA publications.  So some will be done
\par 
\par          20    to a lesser extent than what I am showing you
\par 
\par          21    here on a generic basis.
\par 
\par          22              Again the AEO is one of four annual

\par 
\par           1    products produced by the EIA office of
\par 
\par           2    Integrated Analysis and Forecasting.  The
\par 
\par           3    others are the International Energy Outlook,
\par 
\par           4    the voluntary report on greenhouse gases, and
\par 
\par           5    the emissions of greenhouse gas, the
\par 
\par           6    inventory report.  This is just the cover of
\par 
\par           7    the AEO just to put it in reference if you've
\par 
\par           8    seen the publication itself.
\par 
\par           9              Now, the AEO is produced using the
\par 
\par          10    national energy modeling system which is
\par 
\par          11    summarized here.  I don't intend to discuss
\par 
\par          12    the model itself.  I am just putting this up
\par 
\par          13    here for a reference.  But if you have
\par 
\par          14    questions, I'd be happy to try to answer
\par 
\par          15    them.
\par 
\par          16              And before I get into the nuts and
\par 
\par          17    bolts, I wanted to pose some questions I'd
\par 
\par          18    like the committee to keep in mind as I go
\par 
\par          19    through my presentation.  First, is the
\par 
\par          20    external review process sufficient?  Do we
\par 
\par          21    need to expand the number, or type of
\par 
\par          22    reviewers included in the process?  Are there

\par                                                              7
\par 
\par           1    ways in which the review process could be
\par 
\par           2    streamlined?  As I'll point our later, it
\par 
\par           3    takes a great deal of time the way it is done
\par 
\par           4    right now.
\par 
\par           5              Are there other aspects of the AEO
\par 
\par           6    that need to be reviewed, which we are not
\par 
\par           7    touching on?  And how do we balance that need
\par 
\par           8    to provide an independent projection and
\par 
\par           9    analysis with stakeholders' inputs, which we
\par 
\par          10    may or may not agree with?
\par 
\par          11              And we try to balance fi\ltrpar ve major
\par 
\par          12    objectives in producing the AEO.  First, we
\par 
\par          13    want to ensure that the AEO addresses areas
\par 
\par          14    of interest to stakeholders.  They want it to
\par 
\par          15    have some relevancy.  The AEO is an EIA
\par 
\par          16    product not an OIAF product, so we want to
\par 
\par          17    make sure the projections include input from
\par 
\par          18    all of EIA.
\par 
\par          19              The projections include data that
\par 
\par          20    EIA reports as historical time series and
\par 
\par          21    other publications.  We want to make sure
\par 
\par          22    that the data reported in the AEO was

\par 
\par           1    reasonably consistent with the reported EIA
\par 
\par           2    historical data.  The models need to be
\par 
\par           3    regularly reviewed to make sure they are
\par 
\par           4    consistent with current thought, policy,
\par 
\par           5    market trends, and technology, so that they
\par 
\par           6    provide an unbiased projection.  And we want
\par 
\par           7    to make sure that the models and results are
\par 
\par           8    completely documented for use as a reference.
\par 
\par           9              Now, the AEO production process
\par 
\par          10    itself is a year round process.  In fact it
\par 
\par          11    takes a little more than a year to actually
\par 
\par          12    complete.  The data and model development
\par 
\par          13    takes place roughly between January and
\par 
\par          14    September of a calendar year.  The projection
\par 
\par          15    development and analysis takes place between
\par 
\par          16    August and roughly October, sometimes a
\par 
\par          17    little later, with the projection development
\par 
\par          18    process focused during the early months of
\par 
\par          19    that period and the analysis during the later
\par 
\par          20    months of that period.
\par 
\par          21              The publication and documentation
\par 
\par          22    processes are completed between roughly

\par 
\par           1    October and April.  Again, that slips a
\par 
\par           2    little bit depending on the year.  And that
\par 
\par           3    process includes multiple documents.  We have
\par 
\par           4    what's called the AEO Retrospective Review,
\par 
\par           5    which is completed between August and
\par 
\par           6    January, which looks at the AEO relative to
\par 
\par           7    another year of actual historical data and
\par 
\par           8    looks for the biases or errors within the AEO
\par 
\par           9    forecast itself, so it's really looking back
\par 
\par          10    one year.  It's done with a retrospective,
\par 
\par          11    the previous AEO.
\par 
\par          12              The AEO Summary Publication, which
\par 
\par          13    is the cover I showed you before, which is
\par 
\par          14    completed between October and roughly
\par 
\par          15    February.  And the methodology reports are
\par 
\par          16    which are completed between January and April
\par 
\par          17    and sometimes a little bit later, depending
\par 
\par          18    on where we are.  There's a series of a 12 or
\par 
\par          19    13 different methodology reports.
\par 
\par          20              Now, the AEO Quality Control
\par 
\par          21    Process is applied at all steps of the
\par 
\par          22    process.  We do a reassessment of newly

\par 
\par           1    available historical data, which is used as
\par 
\par           2    an input to update the model's relationships
\par 
\par           3    and to develop assumptions.  We regularly
\par 
\par           4    review and revise the models to add
\par 
\par           5    additional modeling capability.
\par 
\par           6              The preliminary projection results
\par 
\par           7    are regularly reviewed for many weeks before
\par 
\par           8    they are actually finalized and put out as an
\par 
\par           9    EIA product.  And all publications and
\par 
\par          10    documentations of both the projection results
\par 
\par          11    and the models are carefully reviewed before
\par 
\par          12    they are released.
\par 
\par          13              Now, the process involve employees,
\par 
\par          14    both external and internal stakeholders in
\par 
\par          15    the process.  The external reviews are both
\par 
\par          16    formal, for example, surveys, peer review
\par 
\par          17    process, working groups, independent expert
\par 
\par          18    reviews, as well as the conference
\par 
\par          19    presentations themselves, and informal,

\par          20    questions we receive from users after the

\par 
\par           1    course of the year.
\par 
\par           2              Now, the internal reviews are
\par 
\par           3    completed at multiple levels within EIA.  For
\par 
\par           4    example, at the OIAF office level by staff
\par 
\par           5    and management, by other EIA offices through
\par 
\par           6    the category-run review process to
\par 
\par           7    participation in the working groups I
\par 
\par           8    mentioned, participation in the development
\par 
\par           9    of assumptions and models, the direct review
\par 
\par          10    of draft of the projection results as well as
\par 
\par          11    a review of the documentation.
\par 
\par          12              We also have participation by EIA
\par 
\par          13    senior management, through multiple
\par 
\par          14    presentations of key assumptions as well as
\par 
\par          15    projection results.
\par 
\par          16              Now, the timing of the input to the
\par 
\par          17    quality control process varies.  For example,
\par 
\par          18    much of the external input, particularly the
\par 
\par          19    informal input, is after the fact.  Users are
\par 
\par          20    reacting to published results.  So that type
\par 
\par          21    of review tends to impact the following
\par 
\par          22    year's AEO.  It's really a following process.

\par           1              However, that's not always the
\par 
\par           2    case.  Some of the external review includes
\par 
\par           3    as I said the independent expert reviews,
\par 
\par           4    working groups, which are completed during
\par 
\par           5    the development process or in some cases
\par 
\par           6    before we begin the development process for
\par 
\par           7    certain model pieces.  The internal input
\par 
\par           8    tends to coincide with the process, and is
\par 
\par           9    incorporated into the AEO prior to release.
\par 
\par          10              Now, the next few slides I'll step
\par

\par 
\par          12    major step in the AEO, starting with the data
\par 
\par          13    update process.
\par 
\par          14              Now, quality control during the
\par

\par 
\par           8    with the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The
\par 
\par           9    STEO projection is reviewed by OIAF analysts
\par 
\par          10    and management for consistency, relative to
\par 
\par          11    what the forecast would do for the same
\par 
\par          12    years.  And that's not just done after the
\par 
\par          13    STEO is completed.  It involves discussion

\par 
\par           3              And turning to the Model Update
\par 
\par           4    Process, the need for model updates is
\par 
\par           5    identified through independent expert
\par 
\par           6    reviews, customer comments received on the
\par 
\par           7    previous AEO, and of course internal analyst
\par 
\par           8    review of energy market trends.  A lot of the
\par 
\par           9    information comes right out of that.
\par 
\par          10              The proposed model updates are
\par 
\par          11    discussed with working groups, which are
\par 
\par          12    composed of a mix of internal and external
\par 
\par          13    stakeholders at the beginning of the AEO
\par 
\par          14    process and with OIAF management.  Once the
\par 
\par          15    updates are completed they are reviewed by
\par 
\par          16    the analysts, OIAF management, and the
\par 
\par          17    working groups again at a later time.
\par 
\par          18              The OIAF managers also hold weekly
\par 
\par          19    run reviews with the analyst to track model
\par 
\par          20    progress.  We do those in three sub groups
\par 
\par          21    stretched out over about three hours once a
\par 
\par          22    week.  So it's a pretty extensive process and

\par

\par 
\par           4    management, and again in those working group
\par 
\par           5    meetings.  Major updates are those that are
\par 
\par           6    particularly sensitive include a review by
\par 
\par           7    EIA's most senior management, for example,
\par 
\par           8    last year we did a lot of work in the area of
\par 
\par           9    ethanol and we talked directly with senior
\par 
\par          10    management before those that was finally
\par 
\par          11    incorporated.  The model updates are also
\par 
\par          12    reviewed by SMG, as part the documentation
\par 
\par          13    review.
\par 
\par          14              And finally we conduct an external
\par 
\par          15    peer review that includes questions on the
\par 
\par          16    modeling, which feed into the next year's
\par 
\par          17    AEO.  The external review are composed of
\par

\par 
\par          19    familiar with the models and projections,

\par 
\par           3    who look at the forecast.
\par 
\par           4              And next is the projection analysis
\par 
\par           5    quality control process.  Again OIAF managers
\par 
\par           6    meet weekly to discuss projection progress to
\par 
\par           7    identify issues and priorities.  A weekly run
\par 
\par           8    review is again had with the analyst to
\par 
\par           9    discuss draft results, to identify issues and
\par 
\par          10    track projection progress.  It's again
\par 
\par          11    formatted in to the same breakout in terms of
\par 
\par          12    three subgroups for about three hours once a

\par 
\par          16    done as one large joint session.  And that
\par 
\par          17    allows the analyst to provide comments
\par 
\par          18    outside their work area, so I can have the
\par 
\par          19    residential analyst saying something about

\par 
\par           4    prices are going to be much higher or much
\par 
\par           5    lower, because it directly impacts what their

\par           7    capacities is going to look like.

\par           8              Now, early in the process the
\par

\par

\par 
\par          13    discussed with the working groups.  This is

\par 
\par          15    working groups to basically allow input prior
\par 
\par          16    to finalization of the numbers.
\par 
\par          17              We also brief all the EIA offices
\par 
\par          18    on preliminarily projection results prior to
\par 
\par          19    completion, to get their input.  The

\par

\par 
\par           6    themselves, not just the modeling which
\par 
\par           7    provides input to future AEOs.  And that
\par 
\par           8    retrospective review which I mentioned
\par 
\par           9    earlier measures the error in the AEO

\par 
\par          14    information on the magnitude as well as the
\par 
\par          15    direction of error and it uses it in the

\par

\par

\par 
\par           6              That summarizes the quality control
\par 
\par           7    process.  It's an extensive process and I
\par 
\par           8    hope that it leads you to assume that the
\par 
\par           9    analysis that we are putting out is actually
\par 
\par          10    heavily reviewed, and it works.
\par 
\par          11              It involves both internal and
\par 
\par          12    external participants.  It is applied at all
\par 
\par          13    levels of the production process.  It
\par 
\par          14    provides input to both the current and future
\par 
\par          15    AEOs.
\par 
\par          16              But one drawback, I think, of the
\par 
\par          17    process as it's currently done is it's very
\par 
\par          18    time consuming and resource-intensive.  So
\par 
\par          19    you have to weigh that cost/benefit that's
\par 
\par          20    going on.
\par 
\par          21              For example, the quality control

\par 
\par           4    some questions I'd like the committee to
\par 
\par           5    address.  Again, first, is the external
\par 
\par           6    review process sufficient?  I think you know
\par 
\par           7    my answer, but I'll wait for yours.
\par 
\par           8              Do we need to expand the number or
\par 
\par       \ltrpar     9    type of reviewers included in the process?
\par 
\par          10    Are there ways in which the review process
\par 
\par          11    could be streamlined?  Are there other
\par 
\par          12    aspects of the AEO that need to be reviewed,
\par 
\par          13    either more extensively or in a different
\par 
\par          14    way?
\par 
\par          15              And how do we balance that need to
\par 
\par          16    provide an independent projection which is
\par 
\par          17    what the AEO is, with stakeholders' inputs
\par 
\par          18    which we may or may not agree with?  We can't
\par 
\par          19    satisfy every single comment we get, because
\par 
\par          20    they are many times conflicting.
\par 
\par          21              And that's it.  I'd be happy to
\par 
\par          22    answer any clarifying questions if anyone has

\par 
\par          10    his questions, not Paul's questions.  So if
\par 
\par          11    you have some input --
\par 
\par          12              MR. HOLTBERG:  I could do it any
\par

\par

\par 
\par           5    have one particular question and that was
\par 
\par           6    specifically I haven't looked at the,
\par 
\par           7    basically what you call the retrospective
\par 
\par           8    review.  Can you say a just a few sentences
\par 
\par           9    about how good or accurate the Annual Energy
\par 
\par          10    Outlook is?
\par 
\par          11              And I know you forecast hundreds,
\par 
\par          12    if not thousands of variables under dozens of
\par 
\par          13    different scenarios, so it's a challenge to
\par 
\par          14    try to summarize that in a few sentences, but
\par 
\par          15    perhaps you reflected on that, and can do
\par 
\par          16    that.
\par 
\par          17              MR. HOLTBERG:  Let me correct you
\par 
\par          18    on one thing first, and I try to say this in
\par 
\par          19    every audience I can.  The AEO is a
\par 
\par          20    projection, not a forecast.
\par 
\par          21              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Okay.
\par 
\par          22              MR. HOLTBERG:  And why that's

\par 
\par           1    important is because by definition we do not
\par 
\par           2    assume or try to forecast new policy or new
\par 
\par           3    changes.
\par 
\par           4              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  No, I understand
\par 
\par           5    that.
\par 
\par           6              MR. HOLTBERG:  And so when you are
\par 
\par           7    looking back at older AEOs it's somewhat
\par 
\par           8    undermined if that policy is changed over
\par 
\par           9    time.  That said and done, when we look at it
\par 
\par          10    usually we are the furthest off in terms of
\par 
\par          11    energy prices.
\par 
\par          12              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  You mean that's
\par 
\par          13    where the error is the highest.
\par 
\par          14              MR. HOLTBERG:  That's where you see
\par 
\par          15    the highest errors, okay?
\par 
\par          16              We are much better on economic
\par 
\par          17    growth, we are actually much better on energy
\par 
\par          18    consumption.  And we are much better from the
\par 
\par          19    supply to many extents, which means those
\par 
\par          20    prices tend to be offsetting.  They tend to
\par 
\par          21    be moving in the same direction, the error
\par 
\par          22    tends to be moving in the same direction.

\par

\par           4    And it has shown a marked improvement with a
\par 
\par           5    newer modeling structure than what we had
\par 
\par           6    previously been doing, so we are starting at

\par 
\par          14    you get from internal and external reviewers?

\par          15              MR. HOLTBERG:  All kinds.
\par

\par 
\par          17              MR. HOLTBERG:  No, I mean,
\par 
\par          18    seriously, it really does go the gamut,
\par 
\par          19    because you have people who have vested
\par 
\par          20    interests in what they are commenting on, and
\par 
\par          21    they'd like to see results go in one

\par 
\par          11              It really has to do with are we
\par 
\par          12    meeting certain trends that people see out
\par 
\par          13    there.  For example, are we reflecting
\par 
\par          14    improvements in efficiency, adoption of
\par 
\par          15    renewables, a lot of criticism based on the
\par 
\par          16    issue of carbon.
\par 
\par          17              Since there is no regulation out
\par 
\par          18    there in the AEO we do not assume carbon
\par 
\par          19    emissions regulation.  However, we do a lot
\par 
\par          20    of side cases and analysis, where we do look
\par 
\par          21    at potential policy on car\ltrpar bon, which we do
\par 
\par          22    point people to.

\par           1              But that's a common criticism.  I
\par

\par 
\par           3    only thing I heard.
\par 
\par           4              Okay?  Thank you, I'll be happy to
\par 
\par           5    answer and I'll be here.
\par 
\par           6              MR. NEERCHAL:  There will be more
\par 
\par           7    questions later on.  And I am sure they will
\par 
\par           8    want a discussion.
\par 
\par           9              MR. WATSON:  Good morning.  Is
\par 
\par          10    everybody able to hear me okay?
\par 
\par          11              I am pleased to be able to spend
\par 
\par          12    time with you and look forward to the
\par 
\par          13    comments and suggestions provided by the
\par 
\par          14    committee.  What I am going to be doing here
\par 
\par          15    this morning in the next 15 minutes will be
\par 
\par          16    to give you a quick overview of the coal data
\par 
\par          17    surveys and the QA processes that we use to
\par 
\par          18    look at the data.
\par 
\par          19              I am also going to pose several
\par 
\par          20    questions to the committee and solicit their
\par 
\par          21    answers to those questions.  First, a little
\par 
\par          22    bit of an overview of our program.  We do

\par 
\par           1    have four surveys on the coal side of our
\par 
\par           2    data collection effort.  And here is some
\par 
\par           3    data or information about those surveys.
\par 
\par           4              I am going to be emphasizing the
\par 
\par           5    IDC, the Internet Data Collection
\par 
\par           6    implementation of our surveys, because that's
\par 
\par           7    where we really get good payoff in terms of
\par 
\par           8    QA, and I'll try to emphasize that as I go
\par 
\par           9    through the presentation.
\par 
\par          10              Roughly speaking these surveys in
\par 
\par          11    total represent about 4,500 individual survey
\par 
\par          12    forms that come back and have to be processed
\par 
\par          13    on an annual basis.  And you can see the IDC
\par 
\par          14    implementation was early as 2003, and then a
\par 
\par          15    little bit later on some of the other
\par 
\par          16    surveys.
\par 
\par          17              Here's some additional data about
\par 
\par          18    that process, as background information.  I
\par 
\par          19    am not going to be spending a lot of time
\par 
\par          20    talking about the 6A survey, because this
\par 
\par          21    next cycle will be the last for that.  And I
\par 
\par          22    am not going to be talking very much about

\par 
\par           1    the 5, which is a very small survey that goes
\par 
\par           2    to the coke plants in the U.S., and there are
\par 
\par           3    only 19 of those.
\par 
\par           4              So, most of my remarks will be
\par 
\par           5    directed primarily at the 7A and at the 3.
\par 
\par           6    The 7A -- we went by it very quickly -- is a
\par 
\par           7    data survey that goes to all U.S. coal mines.
\par 
\par           8    And the three 3 survey is the survey that
\par 
\par           9    goes to all U.S. manufacturing plants that
\par 
\par          10    utilize coal.
\par 
\par          11              I would call your attention to the
\par 
\par          12    column that has the percent IDC, and the 7,
\par 
\par          13    we are around 74 percent at this point.  The
\par 
\par          14    6, we are around 64.  The 3, we've been over
\par 
\par          15    95 percent from the implementation of the IDC
\par 
\par          16    back in the beginning of 2004.  And there was
\par 
\par          17    a direct coalition between IDC rate and the
\par 
\par          18    success of our QA processes.
\par 
\par          19              What do we mean by QA in this
\par 
\par          20    situation?  There are really two parts to it.
\par 
\par          21    One is, is the frame or the list of
\par 
\par          22    respondents that are supposed to be reporting

\par 
\par           1    on this survey a complete list?  How do we
\par 
\par           2    know that?  How do we know we have complete
\par 
\par           3    coverage of everybody that should be in the
\par 
\par           4    survey?
\par 
\par           5              And then after that, the next major
\par 
\par           6    issue here is what strategies and processes
\par 
\par           7    do we have to assure data accuracy when we
\par 
\par           8    receive data from our respondents?
\par 
\par           9              Here is a little bit of information
\par 
\par          10    about the frame process.  We do have
\par 
\par          11    thresholds, cut-off thresholds.  If you're
\par 
\par          12    below that threshold, you don't have to
\par 
\par          13    report on the survey.  Those thresholds are
\par 
\par          14    set according to industry standards and block
\par 
\par          15    out very few firms, and over time, of course,
\par 
\par          16    because of economies of scale, and
\par 
\par          17    consolidation, the thresholds have even less
\par 
\par          18    effect on who is required to submit data.
\par 
\par          19              We do have to establish a base
\par 
\par          20    frame, identify the people that are supposed
\par 
\par          21    to be in the list of respondents, and we have
\par 
\par          22    to revise that over time.

\par 
\par           1              Two of our surveys, the 6 and 7,
\par 
\par           2    you could say that they are self-maintained
\par 
\par           3    in the sense that both of them depend largely
\par 
\par           4    upon frame information that we receive from
\par 
\par           5    the Mine Safety and Health Administration.
\par 
\par           6              Every coal mine in the U.S. legally
\par 
\par           7    is required to establish an MSHA ID and
\par 
\par           8    register with Mine Safety and Health
\par 
\par           9    Administration, and we use that information
\par 
\par          10    to keep our respondent list up to date in
\par 
\par          11    that case.
\par 
\par          12              In the case of the 3, which goes to
\par 
\par          13    manufacturing firms, we definitely have a
\par 
\par          14    problem there.  We are challenged to keep
\par 
\par          15    that frame maintained and I'll come back to
\par 
\par          16    that point a little bit later.
\par 
\par          17              Okay, here is some information
\par 
\par          18    about what we do with our data survey in
\par 
\par          19    terms of both gathering it from the
\par 
\par          20    respondents and internal checking that we do.
\par 
\par          21              We spend a lot of time reviewing
\par 
\par          22    the instructions on our data survey forms,

\par 
\par           1    and we take feedback from our respondents as
\par 
\par           2    a basis for those revisions.  If anything is
\par 
\par           3    confusing, obviously that needs to be
\par 
\par        \ltrpar    4    changed, so there's a lot of common sense
\par 
\par           5    approach here to keep things moving in a good
\par 
\par           6    direction.
\par 
\par           7              We're also constantly working to
\par 
\par           8    make our Internet data collection interface
\par 
\par           9    user-friendly and to simplify the process in
\par 
\par          10    order to minimize human error.  So we have a
\par 
\par          11    lot of dropdown lists there, standardized
\par 
\par          12    names, those kinds of things that help our
\par 
\par          13    respondents accurately respond to the request
\par 
\par          14    for the data.
\par 
\par          15              The two things that are really,
\par 
\par          16    really powerful with Internet data collection
\par 
\par          17    are the next two items, and they are really
\par 
\par          18    respondent-side processes.  A respondent to
\par 
\par          19    one of our surveys must resolve all of the
\par 
\par          20    imbalances that could occur inside the form.
\par 
\par          21              For example, some of our forms
\par 
\par          22    require information on stocks, consumption,

\par 
\par           1    receipts and there is a balance equation
\par 
\par           2    involved.  Namely, in that case, your
\par 
\par           3    beginning stocks plus your receipts minus
\par 
\par           4    your consumption plus adjustment to stocks
\par 
\par           5    must be equal to ending stocks.  And if
\par 
\par           6    that's not satisfied by the data that you
\par 
\par           7    entered, you have to resolve that before you
\par 
\par           8    can submit your data survey to us.
\par 
\par           9              The other is automated edit flag
\par 
\par          10    checks.  We have certain ranges on certain
\par 
\par          11    data.  For example, prices.  Your price must
\par 
\par          12    be within a certain percentage of the last
\par 
\par          13    period price and an edit flag goes up, the
\par 
\par          14    respondent is challenged.
\par 
\par          15              They can resolve that by entering
\par 
\par          16    corrected data or they can put in an override
\par 
\par          17    comment explaining why the data falls outside
\par 
\par          18    the range.  And so we have for the most part,
\par 
\par          19    almost complete editing on the respondent
\par 
\par          20    side here.
\par 
\par          21              Now, what do we do on the federal
\par 
\par          22    side?  Because we don't necessarily want to

\par 
\par           7    this tool and it will have a default status
\par 
\par           8    of pending.
\par 
\par           9              The next thing that happens is, our
\par 
\par          10    contractor goes through the pending records
\par 
\par          11    and looks at the comment that the respondent
\par 
\par          12    has put in about that edit flag and makes a
\par 
\par          13    quick judgment as to whether or not that's a
\par 
\par          14    reasonable comment.  If it is, they hit a
\par 
\par          15    "fast acceptance," a standard message is
\par 
\par          16    recorded into the data bank and the status
\par 
\par          17    then is changed to "Completed."  And that
\par 
\par          18    would include every IDC form submitted with
\par 
\par          19    an override comment.
\par 
\par          20              Of course at the beginning of the
\par 
\par          21    process that's mainly what we're getting.

\par 
\par           2    override comment.
\par 
\par           3              Now, we don't stop there.  The
\par 
\par           4    federal staff actually reviews those
\par 
\par           5    fast-acceptance cases and identifies forms
\par 
\par           6    for recheck, because our federal staff has
\par 
\par           7    specialized information about the industry
\par 
\par           8    that probably exceeds that of our contractor
\par 
\par           9    in many cases.
\par 
\par          10              So they have to impose their
\par 
\par          11    judgment about whether or not those
\par 
\par          12    fast-accepted cases are good or not, and we
\par 
\par          13    just iterate around that process for a while,
\par 
\par          14    and we don't close our surveys until all the
\par 
\par          15    statuses are set equal to "completed," which
\par 
\par          16    means they've gone through this two-step
\par 
\par          17    process.
\par 
\par          18              Here's a level 3 check that we do
\par 
\par          19    after all of that's over, which is built
\par 
\par          20    around the idea that sometimes outliers will
\par 
\par          21    reveal problems with the data.  So once all

\par 
\par           1    cleared everything in terms of giving
\par 
\par           2    everything a "completed" status, we run a

\par 
\par           4    doing sorts from highest to lowest.
\par 
\par           5              And we're looking at the top and
\par 
\par           6    the bottom of that list, at those outliers
\par 
\par           7    specifically, because sometimes somebody can
\par 
\par           8    make a mistake and here is an example.
\par 
\par           9              On some of our forms the
\par 
\par          10    respondents are asked to put in the percent
\par 
\par          11    of sulfur by weight, and they're supposed to
\par 
\par          12    put a "4" as 4 percent.  But if they get a
\par 
\par          13    lab report back and it's got 0.04, they might
\par 
\par          14    overlook that and put 0.04 into the data
\par 
\par          15    form.  They're challenged and they put in a
\par 
\par          16    comment that says that's the value I got from
\par 
\par          17    the lab.
\par 
\par          18              The contractor sees that, that's an
\par 
\par          19    acceptable response and they accept it.  Our
\par 
\par          20    federal staff looks at what the contractor
\par 
\par          21    did with it.  They react in the same way.  We
\par 
\par          22    see that when we look at the outliers and we

\par 
\par           2    of data this way that are inaccurate as a
\par 
\par           3    result of problems such as the one that I've
\par 
\par           4    just given you as an example.
\par 
\par           5              The other part of the level 3 is,
\par 
\par           6    we also search all of the fields for null
\par 
\par           7    entries, because again, even though
\par 
\par           8    everything is reviewed twice before we even
\par 
\par           9    get to this stage, through a variety of
\par 
\par          10    routes something can sneak through and often
\par 
\par          11    does.  Not many, but some do, because of the
\par 
\par     \ltrpar      12    comment override feature of the system.
\par 
\par          13              And we also do a bunch of balance
\par 
\par          14    checks.  Here is a page 1, page 2, where a
\par 
\par          15    part of the form upfront has total receipts,
\par 
\par          16    and page 2 has some detail broken out by
\par 
\par          17    receipts, but the sum of the receipts on the
\par 
\par          18    page 2 should be equal to the page 1
\par 
\par          19    receipts.
\par 
\par          20              That is flagged to the respondent
\par

\par 
\par           3    where we can catch that kind of thing.  So
\par 
\par           4    these are sort of backup systems to try to
\par 
\par           5    get the data straightened out as best we can.
\par 
\par           6              All of this is guided by what we
\par 
\par           7    call a checklist, and this is a document
\par 
\par           8    which can run something like five pages or
\par 
\par           9    so, and it provides a timeline, and all of
\par 
\par          10    our survey managers follow the checklist, and
\par 
\par          11    they're supposed to, as the process unfolds,
\par 
\par          12    put in comments electronically.
\par 
\par          13              Of course it's a Word document so
\par 
\par          14    they can get in there and say, "I've gotten
\par 
\par          15    to this stage today" and "This is the problem
\par 
\par          16    we're having" or "We ought to spend some time
\par 
\par          17    working over here in this area" and so on.
\par 
\par          18    And so that documents issues and problems
\par 
\par          19    that we have as we work along.
\par 
\par          20              They also have the ability to
\par 
\par          21    recommend changes, and then they're required
\par 
\par          22    to sign this at the end of the reporting

\par 
\par           3    checklist document on a regular basis to
\par 
\par           4    refine that process.  The other thing we do
\par 
\par           5    is we hold weekly, biweekly status review
\par 
\par           6    meetings.  There we're looking mainly at
\par 
\par           7    response rate charts and cleanup progress
\par 
\par           8    charts, and then we have an end-of-cycle
\par 
\par           9    wrap-up review, what worked, what didn't
\par 
\par          10    work, what needs to be fine-tuned.
\par 
\par          11              And here are some data on some of
\par 
\par          12    our surveys.  This is the 2007, quarter 1,
\par 
\par          13    EIA survey to manufacturing firms.  The
\par 
\par          14    broken line shows you the response rate.  The
\par 
\par          15    due date for this survey is 30 days after the
\par 
\par          16    reporting cycle starts and you can see we're
\par 
\par          17    right at 85 percent.  By that time we've
\par 
\par          18    received 85 percent of the surveys.
\par 
\par          19              Because of the fact that we have a
\par 
\par          20    very high IDC rate here, our staff is able to
\par 
\par          21    clean these up also very rapidly as we move
\par 
\par          22    along here.  So the percent clean of

\par 
\par           1    everything received is well above 90 percent
\par 
\par           2    from day one, because we're cleaning right
\par 
\par           3    away.  This is a good example of what you can
\par 
\par           4    do with an IDC system when you have a high
\par 
\par           5    IDC enrollment.
\par 
\par           6              Contrast that with the 7A which
\par 
\par           7    goes to coal mines.  This is the latest
\par 
\par           8    survey.  This survey is due 60 days after the
\par 
\par           9    start of the reporting cycle, and at that
\par 
\par          10    point we had about 55 percent of the people
\par 
\par          11    reporting back in, but notice that the
\par 
\par          12    cleaning is delayed and stretched out a lot
\par 
\par          13    and doesn't actually get to 100 percent until
\par 
\par          14    the end.  And we're working on that, so I'm
\par 
\par          15    going to come to that in a minute.
\par 
\par          16              This gives you some sort of overall
\par 
\par          17    picture of what happens here and supports the
\par 
\par          18    two graphs that we just saw before.  So for
\par 
\par          19    example on the 3, where we have about 2,000
\par 
\par          20    survey forms every year, we have 920 roughly
\par 
\par          21    of these edit flags.  This is representative
\par 
\par          22    of what happens every cycle.

\par 
\par           1              Only about 250 of those actually
\par 
\par           2    require a check-back with the respondent, by
\par 
\par           3    which I mean we actually have to get on the
\par 
\par           4    phone and we have to send e-mail.  Now, there
\par 
\par           5    are multiple flags for a particular site.  So
\par 
\par           6    this doesn't represent 250 separate people
\par 
\par           7    that have to be called, it represents roughly
\par 
\par           8    a 125 people.  That's a very manageable
\par 
\par           9    number.
\par 
\par          10              Then you come to the 7, where
\par 
\par          11    because of the low IDC enrollment, a lot of
\par 
\par          12    our forms come to us as hard copy forms, and
\par 
\par          13    we enter those forms ourselves.  And when
\par 
\par          14    they blow off edit flags, the respondent is
\par 
\par          15    not sitting there dealing with that.  We
\par 
\par          16    immediately have to schedule time to get on
\par 
\par          17    the phone with the respondent and clean that
\par 
\par          18    up.
\par 
\par          19              So a lot of the edit flags in that
\par 
\par          20    case require respondent contact.  That
\par 
\par          21    represents roughly about a 1,000 telephone
\par

\par 
\par           2              The 6 is a little bit better in
\par 
\par           3    that sense, the respondent contact is more or
\par 
\par           4    less in a manageable size, but we could
\par 
\par           5    easily cut that in half because we have
\par 
\par           6    discovered recently that we have a bunch of
\par 
\par           7    un-needed edit flags there and if we got rid
\par 
\par           8    of those, why, it would cut these data in
\par 
\par           9    half, and we're in the process of doing that
\par 
\par          10    currently.
\par 
\par          11              Okay.  Here are micro-strategies to
\par 
\par          12    improve quality, and number one, get that IDC
\par 
\par          13    enrollment high, hopefully above 95 percent.
\par 
\par          14    We're there on the 3.  We need to do that on
\par 
\par          15    the 7.  Why?  Because of the powerful feature
\par 
\par          16    of the self-editing by the respondent, and on
\par 
\par          17    our side it just lets us do a lot of fast
\par 
\par          18    compil\ltrpar ations of the edit flag and a fast
\par 
\par          19    review and resolution of the pending edits.
\par 
\par          20    And it allows time where we haven't spent
\par 
\par          21    very much time at this point, I have to say,
\par 
\par          22    on cross-survey comparisons, where we were

\par           2    opportunities for doing that.
\par 
\par           3              But at this point we're pretty much
\par 
\par           4    tasked with our current resources just to
\par

\par 
\par           7              In terms of macro-strategies, here
\par 
\par           8    I come back to the EIA-3, the survey that
\par 
\par           9    goes to the U.S. manufacturing firms.  We
\par 
\par          10    have to rely upon industry newsletters and
\par 
\par          11    reports to identify new coal users.
\par 
\par          12              We tried looking at certain state
\par 
\par          13    level and federal level inventories on
\par 
\par          14    environmental regulations, because after all
\par 
\par          15    this is coal burning and coal is highly
\par 
\par          16    regulated on the environmental side.  We
\par 
\par          17    tried to see if we could get information to
\par 
\par          18    keep to maintain our frame.  We haven't had
\par 
\par          19    great luck there, I have to say.  Maybe some
\par 
\par          20    of you have some ideas about that.
\par 
\par          21              And then we can do some
\par 
\par          22    cross-reference to some of our other surveys.

\par 
\par           1    We've done that, and that's helped us a
\par 
\par           2    little bit.
\par 
\par           3              But that feeds into this business
\par 
\par           4    about aggregate balance.  For the U.S., if
\par 
\par           5    all the data were completely accurate, the
\par 
\par           6    sum of production imports and stock change
\par 
\par           7    should be equal to consumption plus exports.
\par 
\par           8    Or to say that a different way, supply should
\par 
\par           9    be equal to demand.  Turns out that supply in
\par 
\par          10    the aggregate here in our data series for
\par 
\par          11    coal routinely exceeds demand.
\par 
\par          12              And so we need to go further to
\par 
\par          13    figure out who we're missing on the
\par 
\par          14    consumption and export side.  My view is that
\par 
\par          15    it's probably the EIA-3.  We've got some coal
\par 
\par          16    users there that are not in that frame that
\par 
\par          17    need to be there.
\par 
\par          18              There could also be an issue with
\par 
\par          19    whether or not the export data which we get
\par 
\par          20    from the Commerce Department is totally
\par 
\par          21    accurate.  So we need to expend some
\par 
\par          22    resources to look into those two areas, to

\par 
\par           1    help us on the frame side.
\par 
\par           2              So here are the areas that I've
\par 
\par           3    identified that I thought would be things
\par 
\par           4    that possibly the Committee could help us
\par 
\par           5    with.  What weaknesses do you see in our QA
\par 
\par           6    process?  What can we learn about data survey
\par 
\par           7    methods from academic sources?  We've not
\par 
\par           8    spend very much time looking at the
\par 
\par           9    literature on data survey methods.  Maybe we
\par 
\par          10    ought to do that.
\par 
\par          11              If you have recommendations I'd
\par 
\par          12    certainly like to receive them from you.  Are
\par 
\par          13    there best practices we should know and
\par 
\par          14    follow?
\par 
\par          15              There is a problem here of being
\par 
\par          16    parochial.  You know, we're sort of stuck in
\par 
\par          17    our offices and we're busy all the time just
\par 
\par          18    trying to get through all those data series
\par 
\par          19    on a week-by-week basis, so really we don't
\par 
\par          20    get a lot of exposure to what's going on
\par 
\par          21    outside of EIA.  And maybe people outside EIA
\par 
\par          22    are doing things that we should be aware of

\par

\par 
\par          11    Bill's presentation, we entertain that

\par 
\par          16    your supply-demand.  When you're looking at
\par 
\par          17    coal consumers, are they pretty much power
\par 
\par          18    plants and other energy producers that are
\par 
\par          19    producing, say, electricity or steam --
\par 
\par          20    burning?
\par

\par 
\par           1    specifically, there are users for coal that
\par

\par

\par 
\par           4              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  And a quick
\par 
\par           5    example, for example the foundry molding
\par 
\par           6    sands use a lot of coal, or used to, I don't
\par 
\par           7    know if they do today.
\par 
\par           8              MR. WATSON:  What was your example
\par 
\par           9    again, please?
\par 
\par          10              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Foundry molding
\par 
\par          11    sand?  That sand is generally a mix of many
\par 
\par          12    things for a mold that is a cast mold?
\par 
\par          13              MR. WATSON:  Oh, okay.
\par 
\par          14              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  And coal is one
\par 
\par          15    of the ingredients, or used to be one of the
\par 
\par          16    ingredients in it, back in the technology I
\par 
\par          17    knew.
\par 
\par          18              MR. WATSON:  Right.  We do have
\par 
\par          19    foundries in our EIA-3.  We have people who
\par 
\par          20    make the furnaces for kilns, which is a
\par 
\par          21    little bit different than what you're talking

\par

\par 
\par           4    consumption that we survey on the coal

\par

\par 
\par           9    that we have manufacturing, direct
\par 
\par          10    manufacturing using coal.  But there is a
\par 
\par          11    small amount of coal that is used -- well,
\par 
\par          12    actually five to ten million tons of coal are
\par 
\par          13    used in commercial and institutional
\par 
\par          14    facilities such as military bases and state

\par 
\par           6    we burned coal in a tractor was?"  So that
\par 
\par           7    amount of coal has dwindled to practically

\par 
\par          13    I'm familiar with is the people who
\par 
\par          14    manufactured the sand or blended the sand
\par 
\par          15    that went to foundries or sold this to
\par 
\par          16    foundries and it consisted of a number of
\par 
\par          17    organics, one of which was coal.  And they
\par 
\par          18    brought it in car-load blocks, or, you know,

\par           1              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Yeah, and well,
\par 
\par           2    it may be being picked up somewhere, I'm just
\par 
\par           3    saying there will be others like it, and
\par 
\par           4    again, I was --
\par 
\par           5              MR. WATSON:  There are a couple of
\par 
\par           6    others like that that I'm familiar with.
\par 
\par           7              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Okay.
\par 
\par           8              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  How big is the
\par 
\par           9    gap?
\par 
\par          10              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  That's the next
\par 
\par          11    question.  How big is the gap?
\par 
\par          12              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  How big is the
\par 
\par          13    supply-demand gap?
\par 
\par          14              MR. WATSON:  Oh.  It's somewhere in
\par 
\par          15    the order of 5 to 10 million tons a year.
\par 
\par          16    But it's always on one side.
\par 
\par          17              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Right.  That's
\par 
\par          18    half a percent, roughly?  Half percent to one
\par 
\par          19    percent?
\par 
\par          20              MR. WATSON:  Yeah, it's a very
\par 
\par          21    small number, but ideally of course what you
\par 
\par          22    would hope for would be, sometimes positive,

\par 
\par           1    sometimes negative.  I would rather see that
\par 
\par           2    pattern, obviously, than always positive.
\par 
\par           3    Because that means that, systematically,
\par 
\par           4    you're overlooking something.
\par 
\par           5              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Yeah, that's
\par 
\par           6    about 500 unit trains worth of coal.
\par 
\par           7              MR. WATSON:  It's a small amount.
\par 
\par           8    It's not much, but --
\par 
\par           9              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  500 hundred unit
\par 
\par          10    trains impresses me as a big amount of coal.
\par 
\par          11              MR. WATSON:  Uh-huh.
\par 
\par          12              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Yeah.  I'm sure
\par 
\par          13    that much is not going into the foundries.
\par 
\par          14              MR. WATSON:  Yeah, I think we are
\par 
\par          15    going to look more carefully at commercial
\par 
\par          16    and institutional.  We may not have good
\par 
\par          17    coverage there, so we may be able to pick up
\par 
\par          18    a couple million tons or so there, and maybe
\par 
\par          19    a couple of million tons on exports.
\par 
\par          20              And then after that because of the
\par 
\par          21    sort of phasing of when you collect the data,
\par 
\par          22    sometimes of course our data may be out of

\par 
\par           3    zero, sometimes plus, sometimes negative,
\par 
\par           4    that's sort of the pattern that we would like
\par 
\par           5    to see here.
\par 
\par           6              MR. FEDER:  You mentioned
\par 
\par           7    identifying your users through newsletters
\par 
\par           8    and bulletins and things like that.  Is it
\par 
\par           9    possible you might be missing some new users?
\par 
\par          10              MR. WATSON:  True.  Some recent new
\par 
\par          11    users are people that are building these
\par 
\par          12    ethanol plants in the Midwest and they're
\par 
\par          13    using coal for heat in the process there.
\par 
\par          14    And we do get those, we do get notices of
\par 
\par          15    those in industry newsletters and we do have
\par 
\par          16    people who are looking through the
\par 
\par          17    newsletters for that purpose.
\par 
\par          18              But that's an ad hoc procedure.
\par 
\par          19    Maybe there's a newsletter that we're not
\par 
\par          20    looking at that we should be, that would
\par 
\par          21    identify those.  So that is an issue whether
\par 
\par          22    or not we are looking widely enough to get

\par 
\par           2              MR. NEERCHAL:  Is there a business
\par

\par 
\par           4    lots of businesses like Dun and Bradstreet
\par 
\par           5    and things like that?  Will they be useful
\par 
\par           6    for this purpose?
\par 
\par           7              MR. WATSON:  I'll put it down on my
\par 
\par           8    list and see if we --
\par 
\par           9              MR. NEERCHAL:  I mean they have --
\par 
\par          10    essentially it is like a list of all
\par 
\par          11    businesses which can employ at least a
\par 
\par          12    certain number of employees and so on, I
\par 
\par          13    think, I don't know whether --
\par 
\par          14              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  There used to be
\par 
\par          15    something called\ltrpar  Thompson's, but I don't know
\par 
\par          16    if it still exists, or if that's appropriate,
\par 
\par          17    but I don't think they had listed inputs.
\par 
\par          18              MR. NEERCHAL:  No, no, they -- I
\par 
\par          19    mean, at least you can get the addresses, see
\par 
\par          20    whether there is some obvious category that
\par 
\par          21    you're --

\par 
\par           1    something in the way in which they identify
\par 
\par           2    themselves which might be an indicator that
\par 
\par           3    they could be burning coal.
\par 
\par           4              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  But that leads
\par 
\par           5    to the question that the census of
\par 
\par           6    manufacturers conducted by the Bureau of
\par 
\par           7    Census, maybe the -- I'm not sure if BLS does
\par 
\par           8    it for them or who does it for them, but have
\par 
\par           9    you coordinated your frames with theirs?
\par 
\par          10              MR. WATSON:  We have, but it's only
\par 
\par          11    a limited effort, because the data there --
\par 
\par          12    for example, we can compare our data
\par 
\par          13    aggregated up to a state level against that
\par 
\par          14    data.  But then if we identify a difference
\par 
\par          15    they're unable to tell us, because the
\par 
\par          16    confidentiality, anything about the specific
\par 
\par          17    firms that might be involved.  So it's sort
\par 
\par          18    of an unsatisfactory thing except that it
\par 
\par          19    gives us a little bit of a clue perhaps on
\par 
\par          20    where to look in terms of a geographic
\par 
\par          21    location.

\par 
\par           1    the Census Bureau, we gave them our frame and
\par 
\par           2    they matched to the -- whatever data they had
\par 
\par           3    matched with, and I think they found 60 or 70
\par 
\par           4    percent agreement.  Maybe we're a little
\par 
\par           5    closer than that on volumes because of course
\par 
\par           6    you get things that don't match that are
\par 
\par           7    really both there.
\par 
\par           8              And the problem is they couldn't
\par 
\par           9    really tell you very much about what you were
\par 
\par          10    missing.  I think they love it because they
\par 
\par          11    can fix their frames.  But all they would
\par 
\par          12    tell us, they could tell us where we were off
\par 
\par          13    in terms of SIC codes, and tell us where we
\par 
\par          14    were at the geographic level.
\par 
\par          15              MR. WATSON:  And state level too --
\par 
\par          16    yeah, geographic.
\par 
\par          17              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  They can tell
\par 
\par          18    you you're getting warm.
\par 
\par          19              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yeah, so.
\par 
\par          20              MR. WATSON:  Yeah, and there's a
\par 
\par          21    big lag there too, at least in the survey
\par 
\par          22    that Nancy's talking about.  It's called the

\par           1    NECS and it's only done every 4 years, so
\par 
\par           2    we're doing every quarter and so we're pretty
\par 
\par           3    current with this EIA-3 and so we're actually
\par 
\par           4    retrospectively looking to see how we're
\par 
\par           5    doing compared to their latest survey which
\par 
\par           6    they do every 4 years and then has about a
\par 
\par           7    two year lag before we actually get to take a
\par 
\par           8    look.
\par 
\par           9              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Well, the only
\par 
\par          10    other thing I can think of is going to some
\par 
\par          11    of these coal distributors or sellers and
\par 
\par          12    saying, "Could you look over our list to see
\par 
\par          13    if there is somebody big that we're missing"?
\par 
\par          14    And that's just asking for voluntary
\par 
\par          15    collaboration.
\par 
\par          16              MR. WATSON:  Yeah.  The 6A survey
\par 
\par          17    that we run, that talks about or surveys
\par 
\par          18    distribution, so it goes to all U.S. coal
\par 
\par          19    mines.  Actually more accurately it goes to
\par 
\par          20    the coal companies that have coal mines in
\par 
\par          21    each of the coal-producing states and so
\par 
\par          22    they're able to report on all the coal mines

\par 
\par           3              We stopped asking them probably
\par 
\par           4    about 10 years ago the information about who
\par 
\par           5    was purchasing the coal.  So we only know it
\par 
\par           6    goes to EG -- electric generation -- or to
\par 
\par           7    manufacturing, to export, and so forth, that
\par 
\par           8    kind of consumer type.  We don't know
\par 
\par           9    anything specific.

\par          10              In order to do something like that
\par 
\par          11    we have to go to go to OMB and ask

\par 
\par          13    anything that is easily done.
\par 
\par          14              I agree with your point.  That
\par 
\par          15    would have been a beautiful way actually to
\par 
\par          16    have cleaned this up, and we did have
\par 
\par          17    internal discussion about this three years
\par 
\par          18    ago when we did our form 3 authorization, but
\par 
\par          19    there really wasn't much interest among
\par 
\par          20    people above me -- put it that way -- in
\par 
\par          21    doing that.

\par

\par 
\par           4              MR. FEDER:  I guess we're
\par 
\par           5    addressing both presentations.  With respect
\par 
\par           6    to the first one, it's hard for me, as a
\par 
\par           7    humble statistician who doesn't have much
\par 
\par           8    understanding of the substantive matter, to
\par 
\par           9    do it without seeing any numbers, and I was
\par 
\par          10    wondering, there was a mention of
\par 
\par          11    retrospective look at the historical data and
\par 
\par          12    I guess, even though I appreciate the
\par 
\par          13    difference between projections and forecasts,
\par 
\par          14    is there a way to look at those differences
\par 
\par          15    between the projections and the actual
\par 
\par          16    numbers that historically can be obtained?
\par 
\par          17              Maybe in some future meeting, we
\par 
\par          18    could look at this and see how well the AEO
\par 
\par          19    is performing.  It could be easier for
\par 
\par          20    statisticians to look at it.  I think overall
\par 
\par          21    the process is very impressive.  Input is
\par 
\par          22    being solicited from stakeholders.

\par 
\par           1    Internally and externally people are
\par 
\par           2    providing a lot of input.
\par 
\par           3              The speaker was wondering if the
\par 
\par           4    processes may be too intensive.  Hard to
\par 
\par           5    judge, but definitely no stone has been left
\par 
\par           6    unturned.  There's a lot of good thinking
\par 
\par           7    that's going there, and that looks very
\par 
\par           8    impressive, but again, without seeing actual
\par 
\par           9    numbers it's hard to judge.
\par 
\par          10              And I ask also about what criticism
\par 
\par          11    they have received and I understand that you
\par 
\par          12    would get, especially from academics, some
\par 
\par          13    people questioning the assumptions so I'm not
\par 
\par          14    worried about it, it looks like the process
\par 
\par          15    is good.  That's all I have to say.  Ed
\par 
\par          16    probably could say much more.
\par 
\par          17              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  I could speak
\par 
\par          18    more.  Do I say more, is the question.  I
\par 
\par          19    think, in general, we have seen that Paul has
\par 
\par          20    given us a good overview of a process that is
\par 
\par          21    very thoughtful and very reflective and very,
\par 
\par          22    very professional in turning out the annual

\par 
\par           1    energy outlook.  I would recommend or hope
\par 
\par           2    that other agencies emulate the thoroughness.
\par 
\par           3              Having said that, I wonder if
\par 
\par           4    perhaps there's too many internal reviews
\par 
\par           5    that are looking over everybody else's
\par 
\par           6    shoulder and perhaps too many meetings
\par 
\par           7    associated with the actual reviewing, or
\par 
\par           8    perhaps too frequent.  Each type of meeting
\par 
\par           9    may be essential, but do they have to do it
\par 
\par          10    every week?  Or something like that, and that
\par 
\par          11    might help streamline the process.  But there
\par 
\par          12    is going to be a lot of reluctance, I think,
\par 
\par          13    on the part of administrators to shorten that
\par 
\par          14    too much because of the hazard of coming out
\par 
\par          15    with a serious glitch.
\par 
\par          16              The second thing I have to ask then
\par 
\par          17    is, well, I go back to how good is the
\par 
\par          18    result, as the result presented is pretty
\par 
\par          19    good.  But it's got to be compared to what?
\par 
\par          20              So when you come down to saying
\par 
\par          21    prices are the most difficult thing they have
\par 
\par          22    the projections on, I guess my first question

\par 
\par           1    would be, well, what's the accuracy of the
\par 
\par           2    other projections that are made by others,
\par 
\par           3    particularly for the long term?  And
\par 
\par           4    secondly, how does the accuracy of the
\par 
\par           5    short-term energy outlook price projections?
\par 
\par           6    How accurate is that compared to others that
\par 
\par           7    might be officially out there?
\par 
\par           8              Prices are going to be the hardest
\par 
\par           9    thing, I think, to project, more because of
\par 
\par          10    this difference between the idea that this is
\par 
\par          11    not a forecast, this is a projection, and
\par 
\par          12    policies do change and therefore prices that
\par 
\par          13    are actually realized do change.
\par 
\par          14              Markets react to the annual energy
\par 
\par          15    outlook and they say, "Well."  And so they
\par 
\par          16    take that action which would kind of undo
\par 
\par          17    price projections if they are perhaps not
\par 
\par          18    favorable to the economic actor.  So they
\par 
\par          19    protect themselves.
\par 
\par          20              So that one is going to be a hard
\par 
\par          21    one to handle because you can't put policies
\par 
\par          22    in there, except by scenarios, and you've got

\par 
\par           1    enough scenarios as it is, I think, in the
\par 
\par           2    annual energy outlook.
\par 
\par           3              When you ask if the external review
\par 
\par           4    process is sufficient, I'm not sure.  I can't
\par 
\par           5    answer that because I'm not sure what the
\par 
\par           6    types of external reviewers are, the number
\par 
\par           7    of them, or the depth they are asked to go
\par 
\par           8    into.  And so that answers or doesn't answer
\par 
\par           9    or it fails to answer the first and second
\par 
\par          10    questions.  Streamlining, again the internal
\par 
\par          11    review process is very, very extensive.
\par 
\par          12              Finally, I would come back to this
\par 
\par          13    balance question that you have.  I'm not sure
\par 
\par          14    who these other stakeholders are, how you
\par 
\par          15    identify them, and how do you evaluate their
\par 
\par          16    analysis or projections.  And everybody is
\par 
\par          17    making a projection about energy nowadays.
\par 
\par          18    How do you filter out the ones that you don't
\par 
\par          19    consider?
\par 
\par          20              Don't you think you are putting too
\par 
\par          21    many in?  You should be proud of the
\par 
\par          22    projections you do and it is nice to say that

\par 
\par           1    there are other competent projections out
\par 
\par           2    there.  But you don't have to include the
\par 
\par           3    other universe.  The interested user will
\par 
\par           4    find it, particularly if they've got some

\par 
\par           7    some oil.  The oil market is into the action,
\par 
\par           8    so it is not surprising projections are up
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par          11    documents that comes out from the EIA and I
\par 
\par          12    actually very much appreciate the internal
\par 
\par          13    review process that was highlighted by the
\par 
\par          14    presenter because I think the fact that
\par 
\par          15    groups that are not working in that
\par 
\par          16    particular sector, unless you actually get to
\par 
\par          17    read it or talk about it I think is very
\par 
\par          18    important because it ensures consistency
\par 
\par          19    across groups and it actually ensures
\par 
\par          20    communication across different groups of

\par           1    quality of what the EIA puts out.
\par 
\par           2              And the question was how to
\par 
\par           3    streamline the process.  I would strongly
\par 
\par           4    recommend not abridging it, that in keeping
\par 
\par           5    the internal review process, even though you
\par 
\par           6    were talking about possibly, you know, having
\par 
\par           7    it less frequent.
\par 
\par           8              I mean, I don't care about the
\par 
\par           9    number of hours as long as the quality of the
\par 
\par          10    internal review is maintained.  If you can do
\par 
\par          11    that with reducing the number of hours,
\par 
\par          12    great, but a backlog is really important.
\par 
\par          13              The one question I had about the
\par 
\par          14    coal mine service MNA was, you said that is
\par 
\par          15    very low IDC enrollment and that was part of
\par 
\par          16    the reason why it was dramatically \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash 
\par

\par 
\par          18    question is why is there such a limited
\par 
\par          19    \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash .

\par 
\par           2    maybe you should come up to the table too.
\par 
\par           3              MR. HOLTBERG:  Okay.
\par 
\par           4              MR. WATSON:  So several factors.
\par 
\par           5    One has to do with the fact that the frame
\par 
\par           6    there is established by the coal mines that
\par 
\par           7    are enrolled with the Mine Safety and Health
\par 
\par           8    Administration.  So when we start our survey
\par 
\par           9    in January, the Mine Safety and Health
\par 
\par          10    Administration, it is itself -- which is a
\par 
\par          11    quarterly survey -- surveying mines for the
\par 
\par          12    fourth quarter in that January-February-March
\par 
\par          13    period.
\par 
\par          14              And, roughly speaking, every year
\par 
\par          15    in the U.S. coal industry, mining industry,
\par 
\par          16    these are the smaller firms, not the big
\par 
\par          17    ones.  Mines come and go.  We have about 200
\par 
\par          18    to 300 mines out of a base of 1,500 that come
\par 
\par          19    in and leave every year.  And so a good part
\par 
\par          20    of those we don't know about until we get
\par 
\par          21    that last slug of data from the Mine Safety
\par 
\par          22    and Health Administration.  So that's part of

\par 
\par           1    the answer there.
\par 
\par           2              So what we are doing this year is
\par 
\par           3    we are going to meet with MSHA.  They are
\par 
\par           4    able to survey all these 1,500 people on a
\par 
\par           5    quarterly basis within 75 days.  Last year,
\par 
\par           6    it took us 210 days to do it.  So we are kind
\par 
\par           7    of anxious to see what they are doing that we
\par 
\par           8    are not doing, and it could just simply be
\par 
\par           9    they have a lot more resources.  We don't
\par 
\par          10    know yet.  We haven't gone and visited them
\par 
\par          11    yet.  We're going to do that.
\par 
\par          12              And we are also looking for ways to
\par 
\par          13    get from them very early information about
\par 
\par          14    the new people that are joining the frame at
\par 
\par          15    that point.  So that's a part of the
\par 
\par          16    response.
\par 
\par          17              The other part is, we just need to
\par 
\par          18    ask our resources ourselves to push harder on
\par 
\par          19    improving that, and we can do that now.  We
\par 
\par          20    know who was in the frame last year because
\par 
\par          21    if they weren't IDC, we did get a form from
\par 
\par          22    them.  So we can go back and identify them.

\par 
\par           1              And then there is a third reason.
\par 
\par           2    Some small operators in the 21st century
\par 
\par           3    don't know anything about the Internet.  In
\par 
\par           4    order to file IDC, you have to have an
\par 
\par           5    Internet connection.  So there is always
\par 
\par           6    going to be a small number of people who will
\par 
\par           7    only send you a form by fax or by mail.
\par 
\par           8              But if you have any other ideas
\par 
\par           9    why, please.
\par 
\par          10              MR. NEERCHAL:  John.
\par 
\par          11              MR. WEYANT:  Actually, through our
\par 
\par          12    own studies in ICCC and other venues, I spent
\par 
\par          13    a lot of time thinking about scenarios.  I
\par 
\par          14    actually like to start with some fundamental
\par 
\par          15    impressions.
\par 
\par          16              It seems to me that the job of
\par 
\par          17    producing these scenarios is -- just the way
\par 
\par          18    it gets structured is kind of an impossible
\par 
\par          19    task on the one hand.  On the other hand, it
\par 
\par          20    is probably the most useful thing EIA does
\par 
\par          21    that maybe anybody does in the analytic
\par 
\par          22    community.

\par 
\par           1              So let me explain a little bit more
\par 
\par           2    about that.  You know, if you think about
\par 
\par           3    what you are doing, kind of the first rule of
\par 
\par           4    decision theory is be clear about your
\par 
\par           5    objectives and why you are doing the analysis
\par 
\par           6    and stuff before you do anything else.  That
\par 
\par           7    also carries through, I think, to scenario
\par 
\par           8    design.  Because often scenario design is an
\par 
\par           9    element of some analysis.
\par 
\par          10              Now, the problem that you have here
\par 
\par          11    which makes it an almost impossible task is
\par 
\par          12    you have everybody wanting you to do
\par 
\par          13    everything all of the time.  I don't have to
\par 
\par          14 \ltrpar    tell you that.  So I think on Paul's issue
\par 
\par          15    regarding balancing the independent
\par 
\par          16    productions of analysis with stakeholder
\par 
\par          17    inputs, I think the way I come out on that is
\par 
\par          18    you're providing useful information, probably
\par 
\par          19    not credible information, not obtainable
\par 
\par          20    anywhere else, in pieces -- you know,
\par 
\par          21    elasticities, supply schedules, baseline
\par 
\par          22    data, benchmark data for baseline -- but you

\par 
\par           1    can't expect to be moving that information
\par 
\par           2    out in a way that suits the needs of
\par 
\par           3    everybody out there who is trying to make a
\par 
\par           4    corporate decision or a trade association
\par 
\par           5    decision or EPA, or whatever.
\par 
\par           6              The reason I go through this, which
\par 
\par           7    seems kind of academic and abstract, is I
\par 
\par           8    think that's kind of the reality and I think
\par 
\par           9    sometimes I forget and we forget.  So I have
\par 
\par          10    people come up to me and say, wow, there is
\par 
\par          11    an R&D analysis out there that somebody else
\par 
\par          12    has done and they are using that darn EIA
\par 
\par          13    baseline projections.  I'm sure you hear this
\par 
\par          14    all the time.  And I go, jeeze, you know,
\par 
\par          15    you're in one industry, one part of one
\par 
\par          16    industry with one particular objective,
\par 
\par          17    usually with lots of politics involved, and
\par 
\par          18    you want EIA to do the scenario that's the
\par 
\par          19    perfect fulcrum for doing R&D assessment for
\par 
\par          20    that.  Just think about how much comes out of
\par 
\par          21    that.
\par 
\par          22              So I think it's helpful and

\par 
\par           1    probably psychologically good for you guys to
\par 
\par           2    kind of think about, you know, this filling
\par 
\par           3    up half of all of those glasses without ever
\par 
\par           4    feeling unfulfilled because you haven't
\par 
\par           5    filled up everybody's glasses completely at
\par 
\par           6    every turn of the screw.
\par 
\par           7              So I would absolutely not keep
\par 
\par           8    doing this kind of work and I would interface
\par 
\par           9    with the outside world in a way that's
\par 
\par          10    pragmatic and realistic.
\par 
\par          11              Now, on the workload, it does seem
\par 
\par          12    for both of you guys that it seems like a lot
\par 
\par          13    of work.  I mean, it seems like that's got to
\par 
\par          14    occupy a lot of the total resources here.  So
\par 
\par          15    there are two things one could think of
\par 
\par          16    doing.  One is, I think Ed started on, kind
\par 
\par          17    of not doing things, maybe even the whole
\par 
\par          18    outlook.  Is it legally possible to, say, do
\par 
\par          19    an AEO every other year, and an IEO in the
\par 
\par          20    odd years, or something like that?  It may
\par 
\par          21    not be legally possible.
\par 
\par          22              And actually even in things like

\par 
\par           1    the ICCC, which has a 5- or 6-year cycle, a
\par 
\par           2    bunch of us did a critique after four rounds
\par 
\par           3    that said, first of all, you ought to spend
\par 
\par           4    years just assessing how the process has gone
\par 
\par           5    after four rounds.  Secondly, things don't,
\par 
\par           6    even on that cycle, this kind of long-term
\par 
\par           7    issue, things don't move that fast.  So you
\par 
\par           8    may be better off leaving more time.  And
\par 
\par           9    it's actually parallel in a way, so people
\par 
\par          10    can do more new work to be assessed.
\par 
\par          11              I mean, there does seem like, from
\par 
\par          12    an outsider's point of view, when you get

\par          13    these peaks of demand for service reports,
\par 
\par          14    and you have all these other processes going
\par 
\par          15    on simultaneously, that it's like people have
\par 
\par          16    three or four jobs at the same time.
\par 
\par          17              So I don't know.  It's probably
\par 
\par          18    worth considering, but may be hard to do, to
\par 
\par          19    cut down on frequency of issuing these major,
\par 
\par          20    major reports.
\par 
\par          21              And I actually wonder how much

\par 
\par           2    done that every 2 years, there would be an
\par 
\par           3    outcry from the user community and would you
\par 
\par           4    feel like you kind of missed something or you
\par 
\par           5    didn't keep up with what was going on?
\par 
\par           6              On the internal review, you guys
\par 
\par           7    both talked a lot about that.  It does seem
\par 
\par           8    extremely detailed and well done.  I suspect
\par 
\par           9    though that we can't really think of what we
\par 
\par          10    would leave out.
\par 
\par          11              So we could turn it around and ask
\par 
\par          12    you, what do you think is kind of not
\par 
\par          13    worthwhile in the sense of not leading to
\par 
\par          14    very much revision, changes, qualification of
\par 
\par          15    the numbers as you go on?
\par 
\par          16              Is there anything that you would
\par 
\par          17    leave out or do every other year?  Or you
\par 
\par          18    know, you could actually rotate and say, this
\par 
\par          19    round we're going to really focus on this
\par 
\par          20    one, and in the next round we're really going
\par 
\par          21    to -- and you could actually chew that up

\par 
\par           2              Finally on the price thing, I think
\par 
\par           3    the other thing besides the policy
\par 
\par           4    uncertainty is expectations of behavioral
\par 
\par           5    change, I think, affect prices more,
\par 
\par           6    especially changes in expectation.  Again,
\par 
\par           7    I've dabbled a little bit in stock market
\par 
\par           8    analysis so what you see is, if you change
\par 
\par           9    your mind about the future a lot overnight,
\par 
\par          10    that makes you go buy stocks or sell stocks.
\par 
\par          11              This is kind of just a follow-on to
\par 
\par          12    what Ed said.  You could say, oh, it's not
\par 
\par          13    just next year that seems to be changing a
\par 
\par          14    little bit, but that gives me a whole
\par 
\par          15    different idea about what's going to happen
\par 
\par          16    for the next 10 years, and so I'm going to
\par 
\par          17    adjust my capital stock and make new
\par 
\par          18    investments.
\par 
\par          19              And I think that shows up because
\par 
\par          20    of the momentum in the system and the
\par 
\par          21    fixidity \ltrpar of the capital stock in prices
\par 
\par          22    sooner.  So I think that is, as Walter

\par 
\par          13    be -- you know, you could look at some of the
\par 
\par          14    other groups out there, but again they all
\par 
\par          15    have their own issues.  So I think you should
\par 
\par          16    keep doing what you're doing and fend off the
\par

\par

\par 
\par           5    There may be just different time phasings --

\par 
\par          19    year, that may be a good way to kind of phase

\par           7    context, you could do expert, I forget what
\par 
\par           8    they said, they have a whole bunch of titles
\par 
\par           9    for special reports on hot important issues,
\par 
\par          10    like gyrations in oil prices.
\par 
\par          11              Meaning you could just focus on the

\par 
\par           2    you know, rolling up your sleeves and digging
\par 
\par           3    in in areas where very little change has
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par          11              I was going to say the problem is
\par

\par

\par          14    more often and that's when it's usually more
\par 
\par          15    necessary to do it more often.  You know, oil
\par 
\par          16    prices are changing dramatically, you have to
\par 
\par          17    do it.  And, you know, natural gas prices are
\par

\par           2    to do it less frequently.  I'm sure we didn't
\par 
\par           3    take the opportunity to do it less frequently
\par 
\par   \ltrpar         4    back then, but if you probably missed a year
\par 
\par           5    back then you could have probably not been
\par 
\par           6    too missed.
\par 
\par           7              Right now, it's a pretty difficult
\par 
\par           8    time because of the volatility in energy
\par 
\par           9    markets along with the policy analyses that
\par 
\par          10    are being considered in the Congress as well
\par 
\par          11    as our efforts to try and get on the track of
\par 
\par          12    a new energy modeling system.
\par 
\par          13              So we're being hard pressed on a
\par 
\par          14    few different fronts.
\par 
\par          15              MR. CONKLIN:  I didn't even bring
\par 
\par          16    that one up, because that's -- and obviously
\par 
\par          17    that's the whole audit control system --
\par 
\par          18              MR. WEYANT:  So what we do try and
\par 
\par          19    do, you know, from a modeling perspective, is
\par 
\par          20    there are areas where we don't have to focus
\par 
\par          21    a lot of resources in some years.  Like, for
\par 
\par          22    the past two years we haven't focused a lot

\par 
\par           2    because the model before that has been pretty
\par 
\par           3    well developed.  We've spent a lot of
\par 
\par           4    resources for a number of years to do it.
\par 
\par           5    Right now, we're going to have to put a lot
\par 
\par           6    of resources into our oil and gas modeling
\par 
\par           7    efforts, and we are.  Hopefully they'll begin

\par

\par

\par 
\par          11    account of limited resources -- which I
\par 
\par          12    pushed for continuously.
\par 
\par          13              MR. CONKLIN:  Yeah.  But we can
\par 
\par          14    recommend that to the --
\par 
\par          15              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Well, I'm going
\par 
\par          16    to build on this idea a little bit, and I'm
\par 
\par          17    trying to -- I'm struggling for the right
\par 
\par          18    words, but the area of, say, should we worry
\par 
\par          19    about ethanol or what is the hot topic is one
\par 
\par          20    thing, but in terms of streamlining the
\par 
\par          21    process, one might look at the process level.

\par 
\par           2    reviewer making extensive comments versus a
\par 
\par           3    reviewer who pretty much finds no problems or
\par 
\par           4    issues, whether they are internal or
\par 
\par           5    external, might be identified as a way to cut
\par 
\par           6    down on the process, not the areas that are
\par 
\par           7    investigated, but the process of review.
\par 
\par           8              So if there is a reviewer who only
\par 
\par           9    occasionally -- some element that only
\par 
\par          10    occasionally finds some things to correct,
\par 
\par          11    that reviewer may be used less frequently
\par 
\par          12    than the weekly or the monthly or even for
\par 
\par          13    the entire AEO.
\par 
\par          14              That might be one way to help
\par 
\par          15    streamline the process.  Other than that I
\par 
\par          16    think I have to go back to what Neha said.
\par 
\par          17    It's one of the flagship documents, and
\par 
\par          18    whatever changes you do make should not
\par

\par           1    this as well, part of the process of review,
\par 
\par           2    processes of for example working groups, at
\par 
\par           3    some times you may have a reviewed error or a
\par 
\par           4    particular meeting we don't get that much
\par 
\par           5    \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash .  But it also serves the function
\par 
\par           6    of telling you what you're doing.  There is
\par 
\par           7    an information transfer that's going on.  It
\par 
\par           8    has value, even if it's not getting the
\par 
\par           9    comments about it.  That's something you have
\par 
\par          10    to balance and I don't know how that works.
\par 
\par          11              MS. KHANNA:  Well, that's exactly
\par 
\par          12    what I said, that the internal review is
\par 
\par          13    actually really important.
\par 
\par          14              MR. CONKLIN:  A lot of times at
\par 
\par          15    those meetings too is if you don't provide
\par 
\par          16    the rationale for what you're going to do, it
\par 
\par          17    comes back at you in criticism, whereas if
\par 
\par          18    it's provided ahead of time they understand
\par 
\par          19    it and it's no longer a criticism.
\par 
\par          20              MR. HOLTBERG:  That may actually
\par 
\par          21    cut off some of those --

\par 
\par           2              MR. NEERCHAL:  Thank you.  Thank
\par 
\par           3    you.  This was a good group discussion we
\par 
\par           4    had.  We are running a little bit behind as
\par 
\par           5    you know.
\par 
\par           6              MS. KIRKENDALL:  All right.  Well,
\par 
\par           7    this will be a fairly quick presentation
\par 
\par           8    because I'm particularly interested in your
\par 
\par           9    comments and recommendations.
\par 
\par          10              Back in the early '90s when NEMS
\par 
\par          11    was first developed, the credit assessor
\par 
\par          12    office of the statistics and methods group
\par 
\par          13    ran a model quality audit program.  And this
\par 
\par          14    was probably particularly important because
\par 
\par          15    NEMS was new and as part of that we did three
\par 
\par          16    different steps.
\par 
\par          17              We did independent expert reviews
\par 
\par          18    of the model methodology.  We still have an
\par 
\par          19    independent expert review process that goes
\par 
\par          20    on so that's something that we intend to
\par 
\par          21    keep.
\par 
\par          22              We also had a contractor help doing

\par           1    sensitivity analysis and other specific
\par 
\par           2    analysis of model performance.
\par 
\par           3              And then the last step involved
\par 
\par           4    verifying documentation, a little bit like
\par 
\par           5    what we're doing for documentation reviews
\par 
\par           6    right now that Paul talked about.
\par 
\par           7              But we also did model archival, so
\par 
\par           8    the statistics and methods group looked at
\par 
\par           9    the documentation, and we looked at the
\par 
\par          10    archive model, we made sure they were
\par 
\par          11    consistent and then we archived it.  And now
\par 
\par          12    we don't think that that's particula\ltrpar rly
\par 
\par          13    important because the model archival is a
\par 
\par          14    more automatic process.  So that led to what
\par 
\par          15    we're doing now.
\par 
\par          16              So the question's what should we do
\par 
\par          17    this time.  NEMS is going to be revised and
\par 
\par          18    improved and changed and we would like to
\par 
\par          19    have a value-added process with our model
\par 
\par          20    quality reviews.
\par 
\par          21              So some of the things that we
\par 
\par          22    thought about that we like -- and I've

\par 
\par           1    consulted with John on this -- hopefully we
\par 
\par           2    can come up with something that everybody
\par 
\par           3    likes.
\par 
\par           4              One thing that we helped with is
\par 
\par           5    establishing the workshop that I talked about
\par 
\par           6    yesterday that's on December 11th.  They've
\par 
\par           7    commissioned papers on topics of particular
\par 
\par           8    interest.  We're having outside experts come
\par 
\par           9    in and present their white papers and then
\par 
\par          10    we'll have a discussion with internal people
\par 
\par          11    and some outside people also.
\par 
\par          12              And that will feed into what we
\par 
\par          13    decide to do.  So that's a nice format for
\par 
\par          14    getting outside input.  At least I think it
\par 
\par          15    is.
\par 
\par          16              We also would plan on doing
\par 
\par          17    independent expert reviews of component
\par 
\par          18    design reports for the various modules as
\par 
\par          19    they are produced as part of that.
\par 
\par          20              When we were talking to John and
\par 
\par          21    other folks who have worked on modeling, they
\par 
\par          22    particularly think that we need to have

\par 
\par           2              Many times the people who do the
\par 
\par           3    reviews are a little bit more theoretical
\par 
\par           4    than we really need.  We need to make sure we
\par 
\par           5    get people who could give us inputs that we
\par 
\par           6    can act on.
\par 
\par           7              And ways of doing that are to try
\par 
\par           8    to build our list of reviewers to find even
\par 
\par           9    more good people to engage in the review
\par 
\par          10    process and we can probably tighten up the
\par 
\par          11    contract we have with them to try to make
\par 
\par          12    sure that they focus on practical issues.
\par 
\par          13              In the past we did a sensitivity

\par 
\par          15    we've got George, and you'll hear about

\par           1    the sensitivity analysis.  So I'm hoping that
\par 
\par           2    over time we'll have in-house staff who can
\par 
\par           3    help with regular sensitivity analyses of new
\par 
\par           4    models as they come up.
\par 
\par           5              The other thing we do are model
\par 
\par           6    documentation reviews and that one's always
\par 
\par           7    interesting.  One question that came up in
\par 
\par           8    our discussions is how can we make our
\par 
\par           9    documentation useful to others.  We have some
\par 
\par          10    documentation that's really good and people
\par 
\par          11    find very useful and other documentation
\par 
\par          12    that's not quite so good, and it's just not
\par 
\par          13    clear.  What is a good systematic approach
\par 
\par          14    for trying to improve our documentation
\par 
\par          15    overall?
\par 
\par          16              So here are the questions.
\par 
\par          17              Do you have other ideas about what
\par 
\par          18    EIA's model quality audit program should
\par 
\par          19    entail?
\par 
\par          20              What else should EIA do to get
\par 
\par          21    outside expert advice about model quality?
\par 
\par          22              Do you have ideas about building a

\par 
\par           1    list of external reviewers?
\par 
\par           2              And then finally the issue of
\par 
\par           3    documentation.  What needs to be done?  How
\par 
\par           4    do we figure out what needs to be done to
\par 
\par           5    improve our documentation?  Once we know that
\par 
\par           6    then maybe we can act on it.
\par 
\par           7              And that's it.
\par 
\par           8              MR. NEERCHAL:  Now, we are back on
\par 
\par           9    time I think.  It's time for committee
\par 
\par          10    discussion.  I want to start off with a
\par 
\par          11    question for Nancy.
\par 
\par          12              I think you have annual NEMS model,
\par 
\par          13    a NEMS conference, or something like that.
\par 
\par          14    And I always think that if I have any problem
\par 
\par          15    that I am looking for any idea that I can,
\par 
\par          16    you know, use, I sometimes turn it into a
\par 
\par          17    take-home exam for my students.
\par 
\par          18                   (Laughter)
\par 
\par          19              MR. NEERCHAL:  And I think you will
\par 
\par          20    be amazed with the kind of things they come
\par 
\par          21    up with.  Of course, you know, I give them
\par 
\par          22    credit if they come up with something.

\par 
\par           1              And I am wondering if you can
\par 
\par           2    somehow, you know, turn this into a question
\par 
\par           3    that you can maybe make into a student
\par 
\par           4    competition, or something like that, in the
\par 
\par           5    model context, and get some really new people
\par 
\par           6    to think about the problem.
\par 
\par           7              MR. FEDER:  Actually, that reminds
\par 
\par           8    me of something.  I just went last week to a
\par 
\par           9    conference in Minneapolis of syndromic
\par 
\par          10    surveillance.  I'll tell you why I'm
\par 
\par          11    mentioning this in a minute, but this is all
\par 
\par          12    about detection of outbreaks looking at some
\par 
\par          13    data such as giving over-the-counter
\par 
\par          14    purchases, ER admissions, things like that.
\par 
\par          15    And they actually put on have a competition.
\par 
\par          16    If you go to syndromic.org for univaried (?)
\par 
\par          17    analysis of the data, it's a timed series,
\par 
\par          18    and if you can, I guess, be the best, the
\par 
\par          19    victor would win the prize.
\par 
\par          20              So that's a way to do it, is to
\par 
\par          21    make a competition.  Put some EIA series or
\par 
\par          22    some special data and let students do the

\par 
\par           3    way to do it.
\par 
\par           4              MR. NEERCHAL:  I think you will be
\par 
\par           5    amazed at what they think up.  I mean, they
\par 
\par           6    think totally out of the box.

\par           7              The good thing about being young.
\par 
\par           8              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  On identifying
\par 
\par           9    or building a list of external reviewers, I'm
\par 
\par          10    going with the National Academy.  I would
\par 
\par          11    talk to people over there because in the
\par 
\par          12    process of building their panels and their
\par 
\par          13    committees, they consider a very large number
\par 
\par          14    of people for auditing, kind of focussing it
\par 
\par          15    down to six or ten people that they have.
\par 
\par          16              And people at either CNSTAD or
\par 
\par          17    maybe in other areas of the National Academy,
\par 
\par          18    they have lists of people that they're
\par 
\par          19    willing to share, that they've considered for
\par 
\par          20    areas that are relevant to analysis.
\par 
\par          21              I was amazed at how efficient they
\par 
\par          22    are at gathering data on individuals, both in

\par 
\par           1    academics and non-academic areas.  And they
\par 
\par           2    have perhaps expertise in this.  I'm not
\par 
\par           3    quite sure how they get that, but they've got
\par 
\par           4    it.  So that might add to your reviewer list.
\par 
\par           5              In the case of one of the other
\par 
\par           6    questions you had, the sensitivity analysis,
\par 
\par           7    I think much of that should be really done
\par 
\par           8    inside because with the way computers work
\par 
\par           9    nowadays, you can sit there and say, what if
\par 
\par          10    I tweaked a variable, and in a few minutes,
\par 
\par          11    depending on how complex your model is, and
\par 
\par          12    how many other ramifications there are to
\par 
\par          13    this, you can get an answer, and you can do
\par 
\par          14    your sensitivity analysis very, very rapidly
\par 
\par          15    for limited trials.
\par 
\par          16              So that is probably easier to do
\par 
\par          17    internally than to have an external effort on
\par 
\par          18    that one, because the external effort,
\par 
\par          19    they've got to gather all this modeling,
\par 
\par          20    gather the data, get the idea of where you
\par 
\par          21    want the sensitivity analysis, and you can
\par 
\par          22    just sit in front of the computer and do it

\par 
\par           3    is a great idea.  And perhaps we could help a
\par 
\par           4    little bit with a couple of networks at the
\par 
\par           5    time involved in ICCC and EIA that we're --
\par 
\par           6    I'd have to review, because he hit a key
\par 
\par           7    issue here, because I've been involved in a
\par 
\par           8    few of these efforts and sometimes I'm
\par 
\par           9    surprised that they work much better, based
\par 
\par          10    on the people, I mean, and the state of the
\par 
\par          11    art.  They work much better than I thought,
\par 
\par          12    and sometimes much worse than I thought.
\par 
\par          13              And I think that it's kind of --
\par 
\par          14    and maybe contracts helps you do this, but
\par 
\par          15    it's kind of clearly and forcefully defining
\par 
\par          16    and maybe picking people who are willing to
\par 
\par          17    take advice.  What the mission is --
\par 
\par          18    academics often will say, well, it's the way
\par 
\par          19    you're doing that, but the perfect model
\par 
\par          20    would look like this, and then of course the
\par 
\par          21    first thing that happens is they say, but
\par 
\par          22    there is no data.  We have the data, we have

\par 
\par           1    to do that.  So there is a lot of that
\par 
\par           2    finessing that goes on.
\par 
\par           3              Actually when I was working with
\par 
\par           4    Bill Hogan years ago, people used to come in
\par 
\par           5    and say, these models are off-guard, didn't
\par 
\par           6    you know.  And we would say, well, what's the
\par 
\par           7    problem?  And they'd say, well, you don't do
\par 
\par           8    this and that and the other thing, and the
\par 
\par           9    person would usually say these models are not
\par 
\par          10    very good and useful, and he would actually
\par 
\par          11    just look at them and say, compared to what?
\par 
\par          12    And then they're going, what?  What do you
\par 
\par          13    mean by that?
\par 
\par          14              What he meant was, you know, the
\par 
\par          15    models are only useful in comparison with
\par 
\par          16    your next best thing, which in those days,
\par 
\par          17    and still to some extent this day, is just
\par 
\par          18    purely winging it.
\par 
\par          19              So there is kind of that standard
\par 
\par          20    of comparison thing, but I think in the
\par 
\par          21    external reviews, you really have to say, you
\par 
\par          22    know, supposing we were doing a brand new

\par 
\par           1    model, which we are, how would you go about
\par 
\par           2    it?  And whatever constraints you think
\par 
\par           3    actually are practical constraints, you have
\par 
\par           4    to say, well, we can't hire -- we have this
\par 
\par           5    thing in California that's supposed to do all
\par 
\par           6    the analysis with the new rules.
\par 
\par           7              So they were told, well, you don't
\par 
\par           8    have any economists, it's all engineers, but
\par 
\par           9    we'll give you 50 new slots.  Eighteen months

\par

\par 
\par          14    kind of things that we feel we could do, as
\par 
\par          15    opposed to leaving everything wide open as if

\par          17    to do new model development.

\par          18              But I think from my side of this,
\par 
\par          19    that's actually very important for the
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par          16    energy modelers like the people that John

\par

\par 
\par           5              MR. CONKLIN:  And so our first
\par 
\par           6    response to that was, well, what of our
\par 
\par           7    assumptions do you disagree with?  And, you
\par 
\par           8    know, we've got volumes of assumptions and
\par 
\par           9    documentation to start, but they don't want
\par 
\par          10    to deal with that.  We just don't agree with
\par 
\par          11    your answers, more likely.
\par 
\par          12              So for them to be useful to us, how
\par 
\par          13    do we improve model documentation?  We've got
\par 
\par          14    to actually go to people that read our model
\par 
\par          15    documentation and try and do their modeling
\par 
\par          16    based on that or get rid of those --
\par 
\par          17              MR. WEYANT:  Well, good luck.  One
\par 
\par          18    strong point of the EIA is documentation so
\par 
\par          19    one reason people always want to use it as a
\par 
\par          20    benchmark for what they do is it's -- back on
\par

\par 
\par           3    looking at other people's documentations, but

\par

\par

\par 
\par           8              MR. NEERCHAL:  So obviously you are
\par 
\par           9    looking for a few thorough reviewers rather
\par 
\par          10    than a whole --
\par 
\par          11              MR. WEYANT:  You know, the white
\par 
\par          12    paper is another good strategy, if you can
\par 
\par          13    get somebody who is very thoughtful to talk
\par 
\par          14    about it, maybe in stages, what you could do
\par 
\par          15    around the current architectural review mark.
\par 
\par          16              And then you don't have to kind of
\par 
\par          17    take it onboard as a very forceful, you know,
\par 
\par          18    be-all and end-all of recommendations to
\par 
\par          19    completely change course over the next year.
\par 
\par          20    I think that's got to be frustrating from you

\par 
\par           1    say, start this whole part of the model from
\par 
\par           2    scratch.
\par 
\par           3              MS. KHANNA:  One thing which maybe
\par 
\par           4    you do insist -- and I don't know, so it's
\par 
\par           5    very rude -- but when you go to seek an
\par 
\par           6    external review, I mean, what you want to do
\par 
\par           7    is present very specific questions.  And then
\par 
\par           8    think about how you come to this Committee.
\par 
\par           9              Sometimes the best responses you
\par 
\par          10    get from us is when the question is very
\par 
\par          11    specific to a particular presentation, not a
\par 
\par          12    very broad question.  Because then you're
\par 
\par          13    going to have people just go off on a tangent
\par 
\par          14    in whichever direction they want.
\par 
\par          15              So if you actually have an external
\par 
\par          16    review you sort of make them focus on a very
\par 
\par          17    tiny grid of modeling.  Here is where we are
\par 
\par          18    unsatisfied, for this reason.  Here is where
\par 
\par          19    we would like to end up.  How would you
\par 
\par          20    suggest we get there?  And I think you might
\par 
\par          21    get a lot more out of it.

\par 
\par           1    into it with that as a goal.  I'm not exactly
\par 
\par           2    sure if we actually are able to achieve that.
\par 
\par           3    And we work with Nancy's group closely in
\par 
\par           4    these independent expert reviews.
\par 
\par           5              Sometimes in the case of specific
\par 
\par           6    technologies we are very successful.  We have
\par 
\par           7    a need to know about a coal to liquids
\par 
\par           8    technology so we approach people that have
\par 
\par           9    experience in that area and we get some very
\par 
\par          10    good information.
\par 
\par          11              When it gets less useful is when,
\par 
\par          12    you know, we're having a problem forecasting
\par 
\par          13    petroleum product prices.  You know, could
\par 
\par          14    you look at the parts of our model that do
\par 
\par          15    that and help us, you know, get smarter
\par 
\par          16    about?  Then it's a much weaker situation.
\par 
\par          17              MR. NEERCHAL:  Anything else?  So I

\par

\par 
\par          20    comment?  I think you mentioned, you wanted
\par 
\par          21    practical advice as opposed to theoretical.

\par 
\par           1    I've noticed is, and I'm not sure this speaks
\par 
\par           2    to that issue.
\par 
\par           3              The issue is that a number of the
\par 
\par           4    presentations I have seen, in terms of model
\par 
\par           5    building, are a bit ad hoc.  And they may be
\par 
\par           6    the best way to go about these things because
\par 
\par           7    the theoretical underpinnings may not be too
\par 
\par           8    solid or it may be difficult in applying
\par 
\par           9    because w\ltrpar e don't have the data, the ideal
\par 
\par          10    model we want.
\par 
\par          11              But I think it's a concern that an
\par 
\par          12    outside reviewer or this group may have is
\par 
\par          13    that data mining and ad hocery are perhaps
\par 
\par          14    pejoratives, but that's basically the way one
\par 
\par          15    skeptically looks at some of these studies --
\par 
\par          16    that well, we found that the number of
\par 
\par          17    bananas on sale at the local market really is
\par 
\par          18    a good forecaster of the energy prices.  And
\par 
\par          19    we kind of scratch our heads.
\par 
\par          20              So you're going to have to have
\par 
\par          21    some theory in some of these things.

\par

\par           2              MR. WEYANT:  -- who would have
\par 
\par           3    expected that?
\par 
\par           4              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  -- and it ties
\par 
\par           5    to costs.
\par 
\par           6              MS. KHANNA:  And I think this is
\par 
\par           7    just another commentary which is when you
\par 
\par           8    talk about prices, especially oil prices, I
\par 
\par           9    mean, I don't think you can expect that to
\par 
\par          10    predict oil prices really accurately.
\par 
\par          11              MR. CONKLIN:  Well, you and I can
\par 
\par          12    agree on that.  There is a lot of people out
\par 
\par          13    there that do expect us to be able to
\par 
\par          14    accurately predict world oil prices,
\par 
\par          15    petroleum product prices.
\par 
\par          16              MR. FEDER:  But if you're normally
\par 
\par          17    modeling, you try to get in as many things as
\par 
\par          18    you can and show that the residual is quite
\par 
\par          19    low, so that proves the predictability but it
\par 
\par          20    is possible putting some predictors that will
\par 
\par          21    do better than just linking it or just banana
\par 
\par          22    prices.  What you have to do is reduce it to

\par

\par 
\par          17    you don't have the crystal ball but then the

\par           1    there is something you can still do beyond,

\par 
\par           3              MR. CONKLIN:  Well, but also to go
\par 
\par           4    beyond that, in terms of the model, the thing
\par 
\par           5    that drives these models besides oil prices
\par 
\par           6    is really time.  And if you can build
\par 
\par           7    strength on those things that are very, very
\par 
\par           8    important, and then allow for a range of
\par 
\par           9    different oil prices, lines that are
\par 
\par          10    important but you can't build a strong
\par 
\par          11    forecast, and you do that in the annual
\par 
\par          12    energy outlook.  I think that's one of its
\par 
\par          13    strengths.  You do allow for different
\par 
\par          14    scenarios for oil prices, high and low growth
\par 
\par          15    economy and those are the things that drive
\par 
\par          16    the model.  Counting those is probably the

\par 
\par          12    be back by 10:50.

\par 
\par          16    Forecast Evaluation and my understanding is

\par

\par

\par 
\par           1    already asked last time.  And so I'm really
\par 
\par           2    going to report on what has been done since
\par 
\par           3    then.  And as I'll go along, some of the
\par 
\par           4    major decisions that reflect what I'm doing
\par 
\par           5    are questions.  And the Committee therefore
\par 
\par           6    has a chance to agree with what was proposed
\par 
\par           7    to do last time or give me suggestions.  So
\par 
\par           8    this is very open-ended.
\par 
\par           9              The overview of the project is to
\par 
\par          10    work through the methodological and other
\par 
\par          11    considerations that will support SMG,
\par 
\par          12    bringing about a quality control product,
\par 
\par          13    conceivably on an annual basis, which is
\par 
\par          14    designed to confront the accuracy not only of
\par 
\par          15    NEMS but ultimately the short term forecasts
\par 
\par          16    as well to present the differences between
\par 
\par          17    the forecasts and the eventual realizations
\par 
\par          18    of the variables.
\par 
\par          19              And on top of that, try to
\par 
\par          20    understand how differences in the conditional
\par 
\par          21    assumptions made at the time the forecasts
\par 
\par          22    were prepared end up explaining the

\par 
\par           2    actual events.
\par 
\par           3              Here is sort of a laundry list of
\par 
\par           4    the sort of things that would be at issue.
\par 
\par           5    Particular ones that I am worrying about at
\par 
\par           6    this point, in terms of methodology
\par 
\par           7    development, are the parts of the conditional
\par 
\par           8    variables that are inherent to the models.
\par 
\par           9              There are other considerations
\par 
\par          10    which are probably in many cases just as
\par 
\par          11    important, such as changes in laws and
\par 
\par          12    regulations, accidents or one-time events,
\par 
\par          13    and changes in the definitions of the data
\par 
\par          14    series that can make a big difference between
\par 
\par          15    what eventually is offered as the actual
\par 
\par          16    outcome and what was forecast.
\par 
\par          17              This is not beyond the scope of the
\par 
\par          18    overall project but it is beyond the scope of
\par 
\par          19    what I am actually dealing with at this
\par 
\par          20    point.  Further, of the model-specific
\par 
\par          21    influences -- conditional variables, if you
\par 
\par          22    will -- I'm focusing for the moment on the

\par 
\par           1    ones that would be relevant to the shorter
\par 
\par           2    time horizon for NEMS.  So for the regression
\par 
\par           3    analyses that I will report on later, I'm
\par 
\par           4    only looking at projections three to eight
\par 
\par           5    years ahead with NEMS.
\par 
\par           6              Longer term, you have other issues
\par 
\par           7    having to do particularly with technology and
\par 
\par           8    so forth which is for the moment outside of
\par 
\par           9    what I'm concentrating on.  So specifically,
\par 
\par          10    the influences that I'm going to be looking
\par 
\par          11    at are going to be things like the weather,
\par 
\par          12    prices, and the macro economic variables that
\par 
\par          13    drive the energy forecasts.  Things such as
\par 
\par          14    technology, which are obviously important,
\par 
\par          15    I'm setting aside for the moment and that
\par 
\par          16    will be in the next phase, so to speak.
\par 
\par          17              An important question is how to do
\par 
\par          18    this.  And there are basically three ways to
\par 
\par          19    do it, in my opinion at least.  The best way,
\par 
\par          20    and the Committee comments last time proposed
\par 
\par          21    this as the best way for the model-specific
\par 
\par          22    conditional variables, would be to save the

\par 
\par           1    model and then when the time comes rerun the
\par 
\par           2    model with the actual values cleverly, one at
\par 
\par           3    a time, changed to differentially pick out
\par 
\par           4    how the actual weather and so forth would
\par 
\par           5    have hopefully improved the forecast if it
\par 
\par           6    had been known.
\par 
\par           7              For NEMS at least this is trickier
\par 
\par           8    than you think.  With the short term model, I
\par 
\par           9    believe we will do that.  That is my
\par 
\par          10    intention.  But for NEMS, to keep NEMS around
\par 
\par          11    in order to run it later, is not trivial.
\par 
\par          12              For example, I was helped by OIAF.
\par 
\par          13    I should say, by the way as an aside,
\par 
\par          14    anything I report on today, OIAF was
\par 
\par          15    absolutely supportive of me in a wonderful
\par 
\par          16    way.  I could never have done anything unless
\par 
\par          17    they had been very patient with me.  I was
\par 
\par          18    part of the problem.  I had a learning curve.
\par 
\par          19              But the truth of the matter is that
\par 
\par          20    NEMS itself as a computer program also
\par 
\par          21    depends on the development environment in
\par 
\par          22    which it runs.

\par           1              For example, Microsoft has a new
\par 
\par           2    operating system called Vista.  One of the
\par 
\par           3    operating platforms that NEMS runs in is not
\par 
\par           4    supported by Vista.  So when I bought the new
\par 
\par           5    current version which is, part of the problem
\par 
\par           6    was not my learning curve -- although I have
\par 
\par           7    to admit that that was part of the problem --
\par 
\par           8    but the truth was that the software
\par 
\par           9    environment that was on my new computer was
\par 
\par          10    not like the software environment on OIAF's
\par 
\par          11    computers.  This is for the last year's
\par 
\par          12    version of the model.
\par 
\par          13              So the short story is, in my
\par 
\par          14    opinion, keeping NEMS around for a decade and
\par 
\par          15    trying to run it when the time comes is very
\par 
\par          16    hard to do and I'm not even sure that as a
\par 
\par          17    practical matter that it can be done.
\par 
\par          18              Another thing you could do, which
\par 
\par          19    is number three, is just simply save the NEMS
\par 
\par          20    solutions that were made for the AEO and for
\par 
\par          21    special studies and try to pick out of them
\par 
\par          22    the kinds of sensitivities that you want.

\par 
\par           1    This I think is not possible, because there
\par 
\par           2    is just not a wide \ltrpar enough range of variation.
\par 
\par           3              So, as of April, and the discussion
\par 
\par           4    with the Committee, I'd launched myself on a
\par 
\par           5    project to acquire in New Jersey a version of
\par 
\par           6    NEMS and then to run sensitivity analyses
\par 
\par           7    that would support the creation of a
\par 
\par           8    database, that would allow me to pick out the
\par 
\par           9    sensitivities of the particular conditional
\par 
\par          10    variables that I was looking for.  And I did
\par 
\par          11    it.  God bless OIAF.  They absolutely made it
\par 
\par          12    possible.
\par 
\par          13              So that I, now, in New Jersey, can
\par 
\par          14    run any NEMS scenario I want to as long as
\par 
\par          15    I'm not using the integrating portion of the
\par 
\par          16    model.  So I can pick out for the structural
\par 
\par          17    supply and demand pieces the sensitivities to
\par 
\par          18    the major influences.  And that is what I
\par 
\par          19    have done.
\par 
\par          20              The idea of the method is to
\par 
\par          21    artfully design a set of NEMS solutions that
\par 
\par          22    will enable the sensitivities that you are

\par 
\par           1    trying to identify to be picked out through a
\par 
\par           2    regression analysis of the solution data.
\par 
\par           3              Accordingly, just to go through the
\par 
\par           4    list of what I did, first thing to do, of
\par 
\par           5    course, is to find what the roster of
\par 
\par           6    variables is.  And OAIF has two very nice
\par 
\par           7    documentation resources.  One, they have a
\par 
\par           8    fine summary of NEMS which accounts for the
\par 
\par           9    way the variables are passed within the model
\par 
\par          10    and they have a data dictionary.
\par 
\par          11              So again I had a learning curve,
\par 
\par          12    but the resources were right there and I
\par 
\par          13    could see, for each of the modules that I
\par 
\par          14    wanted to work with, how to go at getting the
\par 
\par          15    variables.
\par 
\par          16              First thing I did was to look at
\par 
\par          17    how austere versus comprehensive these
\par 
\par          18    regression specifications would have to be.
\par 
\par          19    I was focusing on the demand modules
\par 
\par          20    particularly.
\par 
\par          21              And the singular question that I
\par 
\par          22    had to answer was whether or not electricity

\par 
\par           1    demand was a function of many different
\par 
\par           2    prices or just electricity's price.  And here
\par 
\par           3    is an example of the way it works.  So here
\par 
\par           4    it is for the commercial sector.  The demand
\par 
\par           5    elasticities for distillate, natural gas, and
\par 
\par           6    electricity, which were the three fuels that
\par 
\par           7    I modeled for that sector, and as you can
\par 
\par           8    see, the own elasticity is just what it
\par 
\par           9    should be.  It is robust and the right sign.
\par 
\par          10    The cross elasticities, except way out at the
\par 
\par          11    end for natural gas, are basically
\par 
\par          12    inconsequential.
\par 
\par          13              So for my goal of looking at the
\par 
\par          14    three- to eight-year time span for the NEMS
\par 
\par          15    solution, having looked at this, I felt here
\par 
\par          16    and elsewhere that in modeling sectoral
\par 
\par          17    demand I could ignore the the cost-price
\par 
\par          18    effects because they were so small.
\par 
\par          19              Which in terms of then designing
\par 
\par          20    the number of solutions, saved me a lot of
\par 
\par          21    work because, as the Committee proposed I do
\par 
\par          22    last time, I should use something like a

\par 
\par           1    Latin Hypercube Design and do all of the
\par 
\par           2    possible combinations and variations, and
\par 
\par           3    that gets to be very expensive if the number
\par 
\par           4    of variables, the explanatory variables, is
\par 
\par           5    large.
\par 
\par           6              So the specification that I used
\par 
\par           7    was extremely austere.  But in the
\par 
\par           8    sensitivity runs that I made going into this,
\par 
\par           9    I feel it can be defended.  And what it
\par 
\par          10    amounts to is that compared to the current
\par 
\par          11    Air Analysis that OAIF reports which does
\par 
\par          12    things by fuel, this approach right now is
\par 
\par          13    disaggregating on the consumption side by
\par 
\par          14    sector and then further for each sector
\par 
\par          15    disaggregating with respect to two or three
\par 
\par          16    different influences.  So the level of detail
\par 
\par          17    is going up quite substantially, in terms of
\par 
\par          18    what is being tracked.
\par 
\par          19              So for most of the fuel demands,
\par 
\par          20    the upper equation was exactly the one I used
\par 
\par          21    for the regression.  I've had the own price,

\par 
\par           4    out, particularly for longer time frames.  I
\par 
\par           5    let that be and used the lagged endogenous
\par

\par

\par 
\par          11              MR. WATSON:  D is just a constant.
\par 
\par          12    It is not a difference operator?
\par 
\par          13              MR. LADY:  T?  T is just time.
\par 
\par          14              MR. WATSON:  D.
\par 
\par          15              MR. LADY:  Oh, D is just a
\par 
\par          16    constant.  I'm sorry.  Let me look -- here we
\par 
\par          17    go.  No, D would be the coefficient of the

\par          19              MR. WATSON:  Okay.

\par 
\par           1    the regressions and later we can look at the
\par 
\par           2    data that were used for this but one of my
\par 
\par           3    messages to the Committee is that, as far as
\par 
\par           4    I can see, it is working like mad.  These
\par 
\par           5    are, at least from an economist's standpoint,
\par 
\par           6    who is used to, how shall we say it, not
\par 
\par           7    necessarily the tightest of fists in terms of
\par 
\par           8    data analysis, this is just fine.  So the
\par 
\par           9    significance of the marginals and the overall
\par 
\par          10    fifth, given R squared, are very, very good.
\par 
\par          11              Fur\ltrpar ther, the feedback through the
\par 
\par          12    lagged endogenous variable, which gives you
\par 
\par          13    an inner temporal effect for changes, worked
\par 
\par          14    very well and I could compare it to the model
\par 
\par          15    output.  And the regression and the model
\par 
\par          16    output particularly really fit very well.  So
\par 
\par          17    within the limits of what was attempted, this
\par 
\par          18    has been very successful in my opinion.
\par 
\par          19              Let me just give you a sense of
\par 
\par          20    what I was thinking when I was looking
\par 
\par          21    residential sector electricity for a second.
\par 
\par          22    One of the problems of course is to wonder,

\par 
\par           1    once you have your explanatory variables
\par 
\par           2    identified, what kind of functional
\par 
\par           3    relationship should you posit when you go
\par 
\par           4    ahead and try to fit the model with this
\par 
\par           5    approximation.
\par 
\par           6              I worked with NEMS solutions maybe
\par 
\par           7    for a decade and have found that it is pretty
\par 
\par           8    linear with some notable exceptions.  So what
\par 
\par           9    I did was I went ahead and I ran some
\par 
\par          10    sensitivity tests to check the relationship
\par 
\par          11    between how each of the exogenous variables
\par 
\par          12    individually would affect the forecast,
\par 
\par          13    versus when I changed them all at the same
\par 
\par          14    time.
\par 
\par          15              So if you look at this output, the
\par 
\par          16    first column shows you for residential
\par 
\par          17    electricity demand how the singular change in
\par 
\par          18    the price variable affected the demand.
\par 
\par          19              Then the second column shows you
\par

\par 
\par           1    added them up.
\par 
\par           2              Then I ran a case where I changed
\par 
\par           3    both of those inputs at the same time.  And
\par 
\par           4    the next column is the difference there.  And
\par 
\par           5    then I took the ratio and as that is close to
\par 
\par           6    one, the relationship appears linear.  And as
\par 
\par           7    you can see it is close to one.  So this made
\par 
\par           8    me not so fearful of using a very simple
\par 
\par           9    specification.
\par 
\par          10              Then, in keeping with the
\par 
\par          11    Committee's advice last time -- look down
\par 
\par          12    here at the bottom -- I ran all possible
\par 
\par          13    combinations where I had a single high/low
\par 
\par          14    variation defined for both the price and the
\par 
\par          15    driver, in this case households.
\par 
\par          16              And since I only had the two
\par 
\par          17    explanatory variables, I could do a complete
\par 
\par          18    Latin Hypercube specification -- which the
\par 
\par          19    Committee said to do, so I did it.  And the
\par 
\par          20    results as you see were quite compelling.
\par 
\par          21    Again, the fits, all of these regressions
\par

\par           2              And then quickly to brag more, we
\par 
\par           3    can look at the summary for electricity.  And
\par 
\par           4    there it is for the three demand sectors that
\par 
\par           5    I model electricity for, and the number in
\par 
\par           6    parenthesis underneath of the elasticity is
\par 
\par           7    the T statistic for the associated
\par 
\par           8    coefficient.  And as you can see, everything
\par 
\par           9    is quite significant and the fit is quite
\par 
\par          10    tight.

\par          12              MS. KHANNA:  Just a quick
\par 
\par          13    clarification.  How did you compute the
\par 
\par          14    elasticity for that --
\par 
\par          15              MR. LADY:  The elasticity is the
\par 
\par          16    coefficient from the linear regression
\par 
\par          17    multiplied through by the ratio of the means
\par 
\par          18    of the explanatory variable --
\par

\par 
\par          20              MR. LADY:  Right.  So it is taken

\par

\par 
\par           8    statistic is --
\par 
\par           9              MR. LADY:  The T statistic is just
\par 
\par          10    the standard error divided into the
\par 
\par          11    coefficient one.
\par

\par          13              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  That is the T
\par 
\par          14    statistic from the elasticity.
\par 
\par          15              MR. LADY:  No, it is T statistic
\par 
\par          16    for the coefficient.  However, this was
\par 
\par          17    mentioned last time.  I at a push of a button
\par 
\par          18    can run it in log form, where the coefficient
\par 
\par          19    will be the elasticity and it really doesn't
\par 
\par          20    make very much difference.  In other words,
\par 
\par          21    this is the T statistic for the coefficient
\par

\par           1    significance of the marginal that you are
\par 
\par           2    measuring.  If I had done this in logs, the

\par 
\par           4    the T statistic would have been about the

\par 
\par           6              Finally, we can admire the results
\par 
\par           7    for the ten data series that I looked at.  In
\par 
\par           8    order to do this, in addition to the AEO 2007
\par 
\par           9    Base Case to model ten fuels, with sectoral
\par 
\par          10    distinction, so in the sector fuel
\par 
\par          11    combinations, there were ten examples that I
\par 
\par          12    went through.  I had to run 94 scenarios for
\par 
\par          13    NEMS.
\par 
\par          14              And one of the things that came out
\par 
\par          15    of this is that this project if it comes to
\par 
\par          16    be established in SMG as an annual activity,
\par 
\par          17    is really another pair of hands and set of
\par 
\par          18    eyes, as a diagnostic resource to NEMS.
\par 
\par          19              In other words, there is no way I
\par 
\par          20    think you could run a hundred scenarios,
\par 
\par          21    changing just a few things, and not find
\par 
\par \ltrpar          22    something in NEMS that would be worthy of

\par 
\par           2    inspection, if not remedy.
\par 
\par           3              And so it was here.  There were a
\par 
\par           4    number of things I found.  Some of the things
\par 
\par           5    I found I didn't understand was because I
\par 
\par           6    didn't understand, but some of the things I
\par 
\par           7    found that I didn't understand was because
\par 
\par           8    they weren't understandable, and the modelers
\par 
\par           9    were thankful and made changes.
\par 
\par          10              So that this project besides
\par 
\par          11    bringing together I think in the end a
\par 
\par          12    credential for the forecast, because I
\par 
\par          13    believe when the conditional variable's
\par 
\par          14    influences on the differences is measured and
\par 
\par          15    reported you will find that the forecasting
\par 
\par          16    systems are dong very well.  Much better than
\par 
\par          17    just a nominal comparison without this kind
\par 
\par          18    of analysis associated with it.
\par 
\par          19              So, that is my report.  I'm using
\par 
\par          20    an austere specification because at this
\par 
\par          21    point the project is aiming at a rather near-
\par 
\par          22    term part of the NEMS projection period.  For

\par 
\par           1    the austere specification that I used every
\par 
\par           2    thing seems to be fine.  There are no
\par 
\par           3    problems as far as I can see.
\par 
\par           4              Downstream, the idea is to take the
\par 
\par           5    regression results and to substitute in them
\par 
\par           6    the actual variables.  To pick out the
\par 
\par           7    differences as associated with failure to
\par 
\par           8    forecast the weather, forecast price and
\par 
\par           9    forecast economic activity.  So the
\par 
\par          10    Committee's advice and the basic idea of the
\par 
\par          11    project I think is proceeding well.

\par 
\par          14              MS. KHANNA:  I actually don't have
\par 
\par          15    much to say because -- I mean, there isn't
\par 
\par          16    much to say about this, except you know, you
\par 
\par          17    ran your regressions, you got really amazing
\par 
\par          18    fits, which, I mean, given your model, you
\par 
\par          19    are going to mag the variables at 21 years of
\par 
\par          20    data.

\par

\par

\par 
\par           5    than comments, really.  Maybe my questions, I
\par 
\par           6    hope to understand and then provide some
\par 
\par           7    advice as well.  What purpose does this final
\par 
\par           8    regression actually run?  What do you hope to
\par 
\par           9    learn from it?  I mean, if it hadn't fit as
\par 
\par          10    well, what would happen?  What would it tell
\par 
\par          11    you?
\par 
\par          12              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  You talked about

\par 
\par           1    would be, you know, as part of answering this
\par 
\par           2    question, what the regressions tell you, you

\par

\par 
\par           6    running the regressions does provide a
\par 
\par           7    diagnostic resource to the modeler.  So I
\par 
\par           8    don't know if I should tell stories on OIAF,
\par 
\par           9    just exactly, but one of the things in NEMS
\par 
\par          10    is an accounting for the weather.  But this
\par

\par          13    cold winter in the year 2025.
\par 
\par          14              But to make it work, in other
\par 
\par          15    wards, we need to figure out how to change
\par 
\par          16    the weather variable.  I did predict a cold
\par 
\par          17    winter in the year 2025.  And the model did
\par 
\par          18    something very strange.  And it was a simple
\par 
\par          19    problem that was instantly fixed.
\par 
\par          20              If you look back at some of the
\par 
\par          21    cost elasticities, they are the wrong sign.
\par 
\par          22    But they are small.  You wonder why that is.

\par           1    So there is a diagnostic feature to this.
\par 
\par           2              As far as the regressions,
\par 
\par           3    themselves, why do you do that?  The main
\par 
\par           4    reason is to give you later a way to evaluate
\par 
\par           5    the influence of the actual outcomes for the
\par 
\par           6    conditional variables compared to what was
\par 
\par           7    assumed.
\par 
\par           8              So six years from now, we can look
\par 
\par           9    at a forecast made last year, and then we can
\par 
\par          10    put in the actual weather, the actual price,
\par 
\par          11    the actual household measure and see how
\par 
\par          12    those different conditional variables when
\par 
\par          13    done accurately would have hopefully made the
\par 
\par          14    forecast closer.
\par 
\par          15              MS. KHANNA:  Without actually
\par 
\par          16    rerunning the whole model?
\par 
\par          17              MR. LADY:  No, exactly.  In fact,
\par 
\par          18    my belief is you can't rerun the whole model.
\par 
\par          19    You can't -- you won't be here eight years
\par 
\par          20    from now.  It is just not going to happen.
\par 
\par          21              In addition, in my opinion, if you
\par 
\par          22    do this year to year, you are going to have

\par 
\par           1    another way to understand how the model is
\par 
\par           2    changing.  And sometimes you can see changes,
\par 
\par           3    across model verges and regressions, which
\par 
\par           4    again look anomalous.  And in t\ltrpar he past there
\par 
\par           5    have been diagnostic results.  In other
\par 
\par           6    words, the elasticity has changed in a way
\par 
\par           7    that just doesn't make any sense.  And that
\par 
\par           8    was tracked down.
\par 
\par           9              Further, for NEMS, the structural
\par 
\par          10    elasticities, as the economist views them,
\par 
\par          11    the elasticities of supply and demand to
\par 
\par          12    their major influences, are implicit to the
\par 
\par          13    model.
\par 
\par          14              And to run the regressions brings
\par 
\par          15    out an understanding of the way the model is
\par 
\par          16    modeling the world.  So the regressions give
\par 
\par          17    you a way to do your conditional analysis on
\par 
\par          18    errors, it allows you to keep track of how
\par 
\par          19    the model is changing.  The process of
\par 
\par          20    generating the data might give you some
\par 
\par          21    diagnostic help.  And then you have a way of

\par 
\par           9    about Microsoft Vista not being able to
\par

\par

\par 
\par          12    before it came out.  And it is really, as I
\par 
\par          13    said, it is a little bit different so you
\par 
\par          14    might put it down.  So it obviously can do
\par 
\par          15    things that the old version can't do.  But I

\par

\par 
\par           5    that.  And your constant in modeling was
\par 
\par           6    austere -- yeah, that is a \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash  word in
\par 
\par           7    terms of -- but I like that.  Now, I was
\par 
\par           8    wondering what -- a quick comment -- whether
\par 
\par           9    or not they are, off the cuff, whether or not
\par 
\par          10    some of the variables you think are sensitive
\par 
\par          11    to being austere, but obviously you can check
\par 
\par          12    -- check the sensitivity -- is that --
\par 
\par          13              MR. LADY:  To check
\par 
\par          14    sensitivities --
\par 
\par          15              MR. HILL:  If you think the model
\par 
\par          16    is very sensitive to some item, like the
\par 
\par          17    price of bananas and then you can sort of
\par 
\par          18    look at that as one of the variables and see
\par 
\par          19    whether or not that --
\par 
\par          20              MR. LADY:  Yes.  In fact, as was
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par          13    in on those, this is over what period of

\par          14    time?  This is, you know, and they serve\ltrpar  sort

\par 
\par           7              MR. LADY:  The time frames of the
\par 
\par           8    regressions can be whatever you want.  But
\par 
\par           9    the solutions themselves, the spirit of this
\par 
\par          10    is that in the end, what you do initially is
\par 
\par          11    what you've got.  So this, of course, would
\par 
\par          12    suggest trying to create the biggest database
\par 
\par          13    you can.

\par 
\par          15              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  I just have a
\par 
\par          16    question, actually.  When the NEMS came out
\par 
\par          17    of its shell, 20, 10 years or 15 years ago,
\par 
\par          18    what kind of computers was this run on?  Was
\par 
\par          19    this run on desktops?
\par 
\par          20              MR. LADY:  I believe the desktop
\par 
\par          21    version and I'm not an OIAF person.  But I
\par 
\par          22    know what is available on the Internet, which

\par 
\par           1    I understand to be limited to desktop
\par 
\par           2    versions.  So I think it goes back to 2001 or
\par 
\par           3    2000.  Before that it was not desktop.
\par 
\par           4    Here's somebody who actually knows, who can
\par 
\par           5    tell us.

\par 
\par           8    Originally, NEMS was run on the mainframe
\par 
\par           9    here, correct.
\par 
\par          10              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Well, this is a
\par 
\par          11    complex model with all kinds of elements
\par 
\par          12    coming in from a variety of offices.  And it
\par 
\par          13    really is almost a, what used to be a
\par 
\par          14    mainframe problem.  Probably still is, in
\par 
\par          15    many ways, where you have a bunch of priests
\par 
\par          16    and servants and priestesses who know the
\par 
\par          17    mainframe, and run it consistently through
\par 
\par          18    time.  When you migrate to PCs, you are at
\par 
\par          19    the whims of people like Microsoft who decide
\par 
\par          20    a new gadget is going to be interesting and
\par 
\par          21    you just undermine the ability to take those

\par

\par 
\par           2    encountered that.
\par 
\par           3              I don't know what the solution for
\par 
\par           4    that is.  I mean, I am not saying you should
\par 
\par           5    go back to an old 4381 IBM machine and
\par 
\par           6    enshrine it, and keep it running it -- but
\par 
\par           7    this is a huge problem, because Microsoft, as
\par 
\par           8    soon as you get this thing solved, assuming
\par 
\par           9    you can get it solved in the next couple of
\par 
\par          10    years, Microsoft will have called Ladysmith
\par 
\par          11    or something.  And then, you know, it will be
\par 
\par          12    an entirely new version.  And you won't be
\par 
\par          13    able to evaluate the progress.
\par 
\par          14              MR. HILL:  I'm sure you can be
\par 
\par          15    happy with older software.
\par 
\par          16              SPEAKER:  I don't think so.
\par 
\par          17              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  But it may not
\par 
\par          18    run on a newer platform.  That is the problem
\par 
\par          19    with these things.  You know, maybe it should
\par 
\par          20    be run on Unix.  I don't know.  But the issue
\par 
\par          21    is that it is really hard to find somebody
\par 
\par          22    who can even write Fortran nowadays.

\par

\par 
\par           6    create a large database of solutions.  Now,

\par 
\par           8    didn't anticipate them, but still you can
\par 
\par           9    probably make a good guess, and a lot of
\par 
\par          10    things you are going to want to know later
\par 
\par          11    and you can archive the solutions and

\par

\par 
\par          15    think the issue though, is that you -- you do
\par 
\par          16    have to spend a lot of time if you change
\par 
\par          17    equipment and platforms and software, trying

\par           1    should be the issue.  The issue should be how

\par

\par 
\par           9              MS. KIRKENDALL:  And it is sort of
\par 
\par          10    interesting, because you know, we've had this
\par 
\par          11    standard that we are going to make archives
\par 
\par          12    of all of our models, and we are faithfully
\par 
\par          13    doing that.  Only problem is you can't run
\par 
\par          14    them after a point in time because of
\par 
\par          15    technology.  The hardware/software changes.
\par

\par          18    actually pulled -- you know, I don't know if
\par 
\par          19    guys will be actually be able to run it, but
\par 
\par          20    I actually pulled some very detailed
\par 
\par          21    information from 1996, actually, because
\par 
\par          22    somebody proposed -- it was very interesting.

\par 
\par           2    we don't fight because we are non-combatant,
\par 
\par           3    but we got into a dispute about the -- there
\par 
\par           4    was a claim that would be a tremendous amount
\par 
\par           5    of cellulosic ethanol by 2017, say.  And we
\par 
\par           6    said, no, we really don't think so.  And
\par 
\par           7    someone said, well, gee, you know, how much
\par 
\par           8    ethanol did you think there'd be in 2006, you
\par 
\par           9    know, and trying to say ten years before
\par 
\par          10    2006.  That's why it was 1996.  And you know,
\par 
\par          11    but the number published in the, you know, in
\par 
\par          12    the AEO was something like 2 million and it
\par 
\par          13    was really 6 million.  So this was supposed
\par 
\par          14    to be a, you know, a see how good you guys
\par 
\par          15    are?  Which, you know, certainly, you can
\par 
\par          16    always do that.
\par 
\par          17              But it turned out that the real
\par 
\par          18    thing to look at was how much total ethanol
\par 
\par          19    plus MTBE we thought would be used in 2006.
\par 
\par          20    Because there was a policy change, going back
\par 
\par          21    to another discussion that we had this
\par

\par           1    oxygenate, which was sort of economically
\par 
\par           2    preferred but politically and environmentally
\par 
\par           3    perhaps not economically preferred.
\par 
\par           4              And in the published book, you
\par 
\par           5    couldn't go back and see that.  And we had to
\par 
\par           6    go back and look at into one of these, you
\par 
\par           7    know, table 2085 which actually has this kind
\par 
\par           8    of detail.  And we pulled it up and it was
\par 
\par           9    like, you know, five and a half, you know,
\par 
\par          10    million -- a billion gallons or something of
\par 
\par          11    ethanol plus MTBE.  It was very close to the
\par 
\par          12    actual number that was used.  Again, not
\par 
\par          13    always the case that you are very close.
\par 
\par          14              We kind of pointed out that, well,
\par 
\par          15    you know, we were petty close on -- you know,
\par 
\par          16    you focused on this ethanol thing, but there
\par 
\par          17    was a policy change and in fact, if you look
\par 
\par          18    at oxygenate, you know, it was pretty much,
\par

\par 
\par          20    prices may be really bad but the quantities
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par           7    fortunate that we were able to pull up not

\par          14    fact, that would be very hard.  But this is a
\par 
\par          15    real issue that came up in a real policy
\par 
\par          16    discussion.  And it was pretty important.  So
\par 
\par          17    it's a hard --
\par 
\par          18              MR. BLAIR:  John, do you have a
\par 
\par          19    comment?
\par 
\par          20              MR. WEYANT:  Let's see, a couple of
\par 
\par          21    comments.  First, I think it is a great
\par 
\par          22    project.  It sounds like you started with

\par 
\par           1    kind of model validation in mind, and then
\par 
\par           2    along the way, model verification,
\par 
\par           3    assessment, different types of debugging
\par 
\par           4    insights all came in, and actually at the
\par 
\par           5    end, you are talking like there might be even
\par 
\par           6    a different way to do modeling.  That this is
\par 
\par           7    kind of the simple model, maybe using a
\par 
\par           8    simple model calibrated into the big model.
\par 
\par           9              One of my pet themes, again, moving
\par 
\par          10    on the EIA stuff like everybody else is how
\par 
\par          11    to do uncertainty analysis.  I'm sure that is
\par 
\par          12    the last thing you want to hear because then
\par 
\par          13    it is even more important to come to grips
\par 
\par          14    with what the issue is.  But you did use this
\par 
\par          15    kind of information as a kind of a
\par 
\par          16    springboard.  You know, the first thing you
\par 
\par          17    would want to do is a sensitivity analysis, I
\par 
\par          18    think.
\par 
\par          19              There always is this fear that EIA
\par 
\par          20    and everybody else who does baseline
\par 
\par          21    workouts, it's tuned, and either if they know
\par 
\par          22    or don't know that if you change some key

\par 
\par           2    and all your investments that looked good in
\par 
\par           3    the one world don't look good in that world.
\par 
\par           4    It is usually paranoia but it sounds like
\par 
\par           5    you've got this brain mapping capability
\par 
\par           6    here.  So I think this is a great project in
\par 
\par           7    many dimensions.
\par 
\par           8              On the validation, per se, there is
\par 
\par           9    a guy at Berkley named Max Auffhammer, I
\par 
\par          10    don't know if you have seen his stuff.  He
\par 
\par          11    has been trying to do EIA -- I wonder anybody
\par 
\par          12    here knows his work?  It's I think funded by
\par 
\par          13    the UC Energy Center.  But this is kind of
\par 
\par          14    from the outside, just doing basic, how well
\par 
\par          15    have the forecasts done.  And I think maybe
\par 
\par          16    some playing it off against some SIPO models
\par 
\par          17    and so on.  So I think that it would be good
\par 
\par          18    to -- in fact, I will send you all the --
\par 
\par          19    probably can send you PDFs and I know some of
\par 
\par          20    the people in his group.
\par 
\par          21              One issue I think that's important
\par 
\par          22    for the EIA is what to do with this stuff.

\par 
\par           1    So far, I think, we have been talking like
\par 
\par           2    it's all internal.  It's kind of another
\par 
\par           3    internal review piece.
\par 
\par       \ltrpar     4              But I just wonder, you know,
\par 
\par           5    worrying, and I go way back worrying about,
\par 
\par           6    you know, good modeling practice.  If some of
\par 
\par           7    this stuff should actually be published
\par 
\par           8    alongside of the AEO or as a separate
\par 
\par           9    document, I would find it even from the point
\par 
\par          10    of view of a journal editor, kind of a great
\par 
\par          11    thing to have in a journal.
\par 
\par          12              Even what you have already done,
\par 
\par          13    let alone some of the things you are going to
\par 
\par          14    do in the next couple of days.
\par 
\par          15              Again, it probably helps,
\par 
\par          16    selectively maybe, with model credibility
\par 
\par          17    that we have done.  We have done simple
\par 
\par          18    sensitivities and even some not so simple
\par 
\par          19    sensitivities, and strategically sorted
\par 
\par          20    through, just as George has presented.  So
\par 
\par          21    that for me is kind of an issue of how much
\par 
\par          22    of that.

\par 
\par           2    about model validation and usefulness and so
\par 
\par           3    on, it seems like this would have been a
\par 
\par           4    great thing.  It actually would be great to
\par 
\par           5    force every \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash  team to do something
\par 
\par           6    like this.
\par 
\par           7              MR. BLAIR:  May I ask a question,
\par 
\par           8    John?
\par 
\par           9              MR. WEYANT:  Sure.
\par 
\par          10              MR. BLAIR:  That is, do I correctly
\par 
\par          11    understand you to be saying that the work
\par 
\par          12    that George is doing and in effect the range
\par 
\par          13    of solutions that he calculates, which are
\par 
\par          14    now available for EIA itself to go back and
\par 
\par          15    check and say, now that we can plug in the
\par 
\par          16    real values, we've actually got a solution
\par 
\par          17    kind of related to that boundary line model?
\par 
\par          18    That there be published in effect a document
\par 
\par          19    so that people like yourself --
\par 
\par          20              MR. WEYANT:  Yes.  That is what I
\par 
\par          21    was doing --
\par 
\par          22              MR. BLAIR:  -- with proper finances

\par 
\par           1    to do this --
\par 
\par           2              MR. WEYANT:  I said, well, I don't
\par 
\par           3    really like this scenario for my purposes.  I
\par 
\par           4    would like one that is kind of in between
\par 
\par           5    here and a little bit outside the range
\par 
\par           6    there.  This would be a much better way than
\par 
\par           7    the way that they actually do it.  Just at
\par 
\par           8    that level.  So but I think it also would
\par 
\par           9    have a credibility validation benefit.
\par 
\par          10              MR. LADY:  Well, I think it would
\par 
\par          11    be a credential for EIA, because there is
\par 
\par          12    some recently somewhat critical articles on
\par 
\par          13    the projections which I think are unfair.  I
\par 
\par          14    mean, how can you be held accountable for the
\par 
\par          15    weather and all of these sorts of things?
\par 
\par          16              MR. WEYANT:  Yeah, I hear these all
\par 
\par          17    the time.  So that is part of my concern.
\par 
\par          18              MR. LADY:  And I'm sure that the --
\par 
\par          19    at least as far as I can --
\par 
\par          20              MR. WEYANT:  I think most of them
\par 
\par          21    are unfair.

\par 
\par           6    potential commercial user, if these -- can I
\par 
\par           7    call them solutions? -- if these solutions
\par 
\par           8    were available, I'd start making my own bets
\par 
\par           9    on the, you know, on the input variables and
\par 
\par          10    say, wow, you know, I trust his modeling.  I
\par 
\par          11    just don't like his starting point, or I just
\par 
\par          12    don't like EIA's starting point.  I'm going
\par 
\par          13    to play it out a little bit differently here.
\par 
\par          14              MR. WEYANT:  One thing I just
\par 
\par          15    though of that I meant to mention before and
\par 
\par          16    I know in the old days there was a lot of
\par 
\par          17    pressure on the key drivers and we've already
\par 
\par          18    all decided economic drivers are critically
\par 
\par          19    important there.  Is there still an

\par

\par 
\par           7    understood it, EIA was forced by political
\par 
\par           8    factors to include those in here.  They said
\par 
\par           9    -- I understand that that case is much, much

\par 
\par          13    been here about four years, but my -- I don't
\par 
\par          14    think we were really ever forced to you know,

\par 
\par          16              I think my sense of the macro

\par          17    outlook, more as a user than before I came
\par 
\par          18    here, was that we actually carried a macro

\par          19    outlook for a long time that until the mid

\par           5    recent, I guess, half of this decade as well.
\par 
\par           6    And then I think -- so I don't know what you
\par 
\par           7    would have changed.  Paul would maybe know
\par 
\par           8    better about 1998, you know, 1999 or 2000 --
\par 
\par           9              MR. WEYANT:  You see, that is
\par 
\par          10    predating my time.
\par 
\par          11              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Also, too.  Well,
\par 
\par          12    so would us.  Tony m\ltrpar aybe can do macro but
\par 
\par          13    whatever, I mean, we had a -- you know, the
\par 
\par          14    economic growth, as I'm saying it was a
\par 
\par          15    period of time when the economic, you know,
\par 
\par          16    long term average over, annual average over
\par 
\par          17    25 years was like 2.1 or 2.2 percent.
\par 
\par          18              And then after some period of time
\par 
\par          19    in the late '90s, I think it got up above or
\par 
\par          20    at 3 percent.  You know, average annual
\par 
\par          21    growth.  And now, I think last year, that
\par 
\par          22    dropped a little bit.  I think this coming

\par 
\par           6              MR. LADY:  This issue is why there
\par 
\par           7    became an EIA, in part.  Prior to that,
\par 
\par           8    unfortunately, I'm so old that nothing
\par 
\par           9    happened before me.
\par 
\par          10              MR. WEYANT:  But in the early

\par

\par 
\par          14    it.  In the early days there was this funny
\par 
\par          15    thing --
\par 
\par          16              MR. LADY:  Before EIA, the
\par 
\par          17    administration could talk about goals and you
\par 
\par          18    couldn't project the macro forecasts that was
\par 
\par          19    inconsistent with the goals.
\par 
\par          20              MR. WEYANT:  Yeah, but I think even
\par 
\par          21    in the early days of EIA there was this, I
\par

\par 
\par           1              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  There was one EIA
\par 
\par           2    administrator, I think, who was dismissed
\par 
\par           3    over something.
\par 
\par           4              MR. WEYANT:  I don't want to get in
\par 
\par           5    to that.  But the clever thing was, this went
\par 
\par           6    on for a couple of years and people thought
\par 
\par           7    they were really on top of us. What they put
\par 
\par           8    into the AEI they completely offset.  So they
\par 
\par           9    made an assumption about energy exogenous,
\par 
\par          10    energy used per unit of GDP, that brought it
\par 
\par          11    down to that more normal forecast.
\par 
\par          12              I think the argument that was used,
\par 
\par          13    it wasn't so much just pure political
\par 
\par          14    pressure.  It was kind of the not-my-job
\par 
\par          15    thing.  That you guys don't do -- your main
\par 
\par          16    function isn't macro so you should listen to
\par 
\par          17    macro guys.  And actually I do think that you
\par 
\par          18    guys are both right.
\par 
\par          19              That in talking this through with
\par 
\par          20    Ron earlier, what actually happened is
\par 
\par          21    people, other legitimate unbiased assessments

\par           1    economic workouts, were irritated.  When that
\par 
\par           2    actually ended the nonsense pretty quickly --
\par 
\par           3    I think that is right.  And I think it was in
\par 
\par           4    part EIA's rule to allowed that to -- to --
\par 
\par           5    that problem to not come up.  But once it
\par 
\par           6    came up, they did get it resolved and did
\par 
\par           7    find --
\par 
\par           8              Is there anything else like that,
\par 
\par           9    that you feel at EIA that we are forced to
\par 
\par          10    take, you know, reserve estimates or -- these
\par 
\par          11    are things that come up in our studies over
\par 
\par          12    time.  That you really got economic wrong
\par 
\par          13    because you believe the CEA or actually some
\par 
\par          14    international -- we did a lot of
\par 
\par          15    international studies so we have this kind of
\par 
\par          16    orderly correct economic outlook stuff for
\par 
\par          17    oil reserve numbers, you have to use the
\par

\par 
\par          20              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Probably not.  I
\par 
\par          21    think George is right that this has been a
\par 
\par          22    kind of the ethic of EIA.  Maybe in the early

\par           1    days, when there weren't experts in those
\par 
\par           2    areas, these things got, it really was not my
\par 
\par           3    job, but then it turns out, the reason I
\par 
\par           4    thought of this is that this turns out to be
\par 
\par           5    the most important thing.  And it's a little
\par 
\par           6    bit worse than weather.  It is kind of oil
\par 
\par           7    reserves or economic -- you know things that
\par 
\par           8    are close enough.  But it what seems to have
\par 
\par           9    happened with EAI is that they have to
\par 
\par          10    recognize that when you have people who are
\par 
\par          11    either become experts in those areas or they
\par 
\par          12    go out and find out who the true unbiased --

\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par           5    being on this Committee.  And I know there
\par 
\par           6    are a lot of people who I never see but
\par 
\par           7    actually keep this up and running.  So I
\par 
\par           8    would like just to acknowledge them and thank
\par 
\par           9    them.  And also all the other people who come
\par 
\par          10    from various departments.  It is actually
\par 
\par          11    really nice to meet folks at the EIA who have
\par 
\par          12    been just names on the Internet for me,
\par 
\par          13    sometimes.  So thank you all very much.

\par 
\par          18    that I think was brought up the last time,
\par 
\par          19    but I don't know that we ever got an answer
\par 
\par          20    to.
\par 
\par          21              NEMS is a deterministic model.  Yet
\par

\par 
\par           2    Where is the unknown component coming in
\par 
\par           3    here?
\par 
\par           4              MR. LADY:  Well, in my jargon what
\par 
\par           5    this is amounting to is so-called comparative
\par 
\par           6    statics of the individual components.  So I'm
\par 
\par           7    trying to pick out, in the end for both the
\par 
\par           8    supply and demand modules there, the marginal
\par 
\par           9    impacts of important inputs.  The big
\par 
\par          10    integrating feature in NEMS is prices which I
\par 
\par          11    am treating as exogenous rather than
\par 
\par          12    indogenious, since I'm dealing with the
\par 
\par          13    structural, rather than the reduced form,
\par 
\par          14    sort of concept.
\par 
\par          15              So when you look at the projections
\par 
\par          16    subject to the limits of first order linear
\par 
\par          17    approximation, you can determine the degree
\par 
\par          18    to which the weather and the prices and floor
\par 
\par          19    space and things of that sort, had they been
\par 
\par          20    assumed correctly when the forecast was
\par 
\par          21    prepared, would have changed the projection
\par 
\par          22    that was made.  I'm sorry --

\par 
\par           1              MR. RADICH:  That's simply a use of
\par 
\par           2    the -- you're essentially estimating a
\par 
\par           3    reduced form, a very reduced form of NEMS.
\par 
\par           4    And so that has to do with the coefficient
\par 
\par           5    estimates.  But I'm concerned about how you
\par 
\par           6    are testing your coefficient estimates.  You
\par 
\par           7    have to have -- I agree that you have to have
\par 
\par           8    some kind of test of marginal effects but why
\par 
\par           9    assume that it is following a T distribution?
\par 
\par          10    There's a -- it is standard assumption when
\par 
\par          11    you have a component that you acknowledge is
\par 
\par          12    unknown but what are you saying we don't know
\par 
\par          13    here about NEMS?  I mean, people built this
\par 
\par          14    entire thing.
\par 
\par          15              MR. LADY:  Well, price elasticity
\par 
\par          16    of demand for electricity in the commercial
\par 
\par          17    sector is implicit to the way that module
\par 
\par          18    processes a lot of data.  But as it works out
\par 
\par          19    that particular influence, say, is reasonably
\par 
\par          20    linear.  And so if you generate a proper
\par 
\par          21    collection of solutions where you've
\par 
\par          22    disturbed that input, then the linear

\par 
\par           1    regression gives you an approximation of how
\par 
\par           2    NEMS functions with respect to that
\par 
\par           3    influence, which can then be later used to
\par 
\par           4    see had you gotten the electricity price
\par 
\par           5    correct, which I don't think is a fear of
\par 
\par \ltrpar           6    requirement for NEMS, you would have had your
\par 
\par           7    forecast be closer.  So I'm not -- in other
\par 
\par           8    words, what you are doing is approximating
\par 
\par           9    from NEMS solutions, the underlying structure
\par 
\par          10    of the model.
\par 
\par          11              MR. RADICH:  Yes.  I see that part.
\par 
\par          12              MR. LADY:  What is it that you are
\par 
\par          13    not?  I don't understand.  I'm not against
\par 
\par          14    you, I just don't understand what your issue
\par 
\par          15    that you are drawing is.
\par 
\par          16              MR. RADICH:  I don't know where
\par 
\par          17    there is a random component is so I don't
\par 
\par          18    know that a statistical hypothesis test is
\par 
\par          19    valid.
\par 
\par          20              MR. LADY:  It is a matter of fit.
\par

\par 
\par           1    order of a Latin Hypercube design is a proper
\par 
\par           2    way to disturb inputs and then fit something
\par 
\par           3    that approximates what's going on in the

\par 
\par           5              So that is what I did.  It seems to
\par 
\par           6    work very well.
\par 
\par           7              MS. KIRKENDALL:  The randomization
\par 
\par           8    comes from the design of the input variables,
\par 
\par           9    how you change the input variables.  And that
\par 
\par          10    helps to make sure that your output variables
\par 
\par          11    will have some random distribution around two
\par 
\par          12    fixed values --
\par 
\par          13              MR. LADY:  Before you --
\par 
\par          14              Mr. WATSON:  If I understand the
\par 
\par          15    question, the sense is to have something like
\par 
\par          16    maybe if you have 50 states, and from that 50
\par 
\par          17    states you are trying to predict.  So you
\par 
\par          18    have to have the full sample.  There is no
\par 
\par          19    way ever that you estimate it all.  But then
\par 
\par          20    you compute a T test.  Well, in some you
\par 
\par          21    shouldn't do that because there is no
\par 
\par          22    uncertainty.

\par 
\par          10    indicates that your -- before you do your
\par 
\par          11    regressions, you're actually generating --
\par 
\par          12    I'm generating a bunch of outputs based on --
\par 
\par          13    on -- no, wait a minute.  You'd have to have
\par 
\par          14    done the regression first to generate those
\par 
\par          15    outputs, don't you?  Or are you -- are you
\par 
\par          16    actually --
\par 
\par          17              MR. LADY:  No, I looked at NEMS
\par 
\par          18    documentation and, not to my great surprise,
\par 
\par          19    discovered that the commercial models, say,
\par 
\par          20    receives from NEMS the generation, prices and
\par 
\par          21    macro economic variables.  And I could run
\par 
\par          22    the commercial module myself.  And I

\par 
\par           1    determined that the cost-price elasticities
\par 
\par           2    were reasonably small with respect to, say,
\par 
\par           3    electricity consumption as projected by that
\par 
\par           4    module.  And I found that the electricity
\par 
\par           5    price and floor space and allowed indogenious
\par 
\par           6    variable to pick up all of the infrastructure
\par 
\par           7    technology that that module processes, would
\par 
\par           8    give you good approximations of what the
\par 
\par           9    model would project.
\par 
\par          10              And so I ran nine solutions where I
\par 
\par          11    disturbed price and floor space and all
\par 
\par          12    possible combinations up and down, pooled
\par 
\par          13    that data, and then fit the regression to it.
\par 
\par          14    And my claim is that if you ran NEMS with the
\par 
\par          15    changes in those variables that you specify,
\par 
\par          16    that that regression equation would give you
\par 
\par          17    a good approximation of what the commercial
\par 
\par          18    module would tell you about electricity
\par 
\par          19    consumption.

\par 
\par           2              MR. LADY:  Yeah.  So later, if you
\par 
\par           3    compare the projection and you discover that
\par 
\par           4    it was high, but you realized that
\par 
\par           5    electricity prices were much higher in fact
\par 
\par           6    than was projected, then you use the
\par 
\par           7    regression to see, had you projected the
\par 
\par           8    higher prices, how that would have influenced
\par 
\par           9    consumption, presumably you will see that
\par 
\par          10    actually NEMS was pretty good.  But the
\par

\par

\par 
\par          19    this tricky thing is, how are you dealing

\par 
\par           8              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Yeah, one thing
\par 
\par           9    in terms of oil, there is actually a white
\par 
\par          10    paper, a service report without a client but
\par 
\par          11    we think it is motivated by GAO and by
\par 
\par          12    General Accounting Office's report on deep
\par 
\par          13    oil and a recent National Petroleum Council
\par 
\par          14    study and we are in fact hopefully doing a
\par 
\par          15    paper that actually tries to discuss those
\par 
\par          16    issues in, like, a useful way.
\par 
\par          17              It is actually focused really
\par 
\par          18    beyond the horizon of NEMS but it's going to
\par 
\par          19    try to see if the way we are looking at it
\par 
\par          20    will, you know, make sense.  And that might
\par 
\par          21    be an extra topic for this group.  Actually,

\par

\par 
\par           5    service for your request and are you
\par 
\par           6    interested in --
\par 
\par           7              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  We're getting
\par 
\par           8    more than we want there.
\par 
\par           9              MR. WEYANT:  Are you interested in
\par 
\par          10    advice on that now?  It's just beginning, so
\par 
\par          11    it will be interesting.  I mean, a real big
\par 
\par          12    challenge for -- you know, this is NEMS -- is
\par 
\par          13    how this had come up at a couple of meetings,
\par 
\par          14    but again, I don't know \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash  \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash \emdash  the
\par 
\par          15    meeting is, I think, with the very good
\par 
\par          16    reason that we don't, you know, the base
\par 
\par          17    cases don't assume policy change or forecast
\par 
\par          18    policy change.
\par 
\par          19              But the thing that I find
\par 
\par          20    challenging is we don't -- we seem to go so
\par 
\par          21    far in our model, our modeling approach, that
\par 
\par          22    the existence of a policy issue -- I'm not

\par           1    talking about any specific, you know, X will
\par 
\par           2    probably be implemented in the year Y -- but
\par 
\par           3    just, you know, if we had two parallel
\par 
\par           4    worlds, one in which if you walked up to
\par 
\par           5    people and said climate change, they had
\par 
\par           6    never heard of it as an issue, and another
\par 
\par           7    one where it is an issue, and you know,
\par 
\par           8    possibly, in those two worlds behavior is
\par 
\par           9    different but in NEMS those two worlds it is
\par 
\par          10    not different.
\par 
\par          11              So it isn't a question of not, you
\par 
\par          12    know, why do you assume that there will be
\par 
\par          13    likely legislations, but this is the reason I
\par 
\par          14    think for us not to do that.  But how we deal
\par 
\par          15    with something being out there is a very
\par 
\par          16    tricky and hard business for us.  And I think
\par 
\par          17    in one way we can get out while, you know,
\par 
\par          18    you are forecasting policy and we are not, to
\par 
\par          19    get at some of the differences, but some
\par 
\par          20    these differences on -- since I know that if
\par 
\par          21    we look at the world without climate change
\par 
\par          22    as an issue and the world with climate change

\par 
\par           1    as an issue, at least I think the way we put
\par 
\par           2    together NEMS, we get the same type of
\par 
\par           3    baseline cases.  And that is a tricky

\par           4    business.
\par 
\par           5              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  The only thing I
\par 
\par           6    know -- well, actually a few things, but the
\par 
\par           7    one I know best is the NERG (?) stuff, where
\par 
\par           8    they have this single uncertainty single
\par 
\par           9    resolution of uncertainty kind of thing to
\par 
\par          10    look at policy and then they say, well in the
\par 
\par          11    real world, factors in the economic system
\par 
\par          12    are actually already hedging against climate
\par 
\par          13    policy.  What are -- what is --
\par 
\par          14              MR. WEYANT:  We don't know how we
\par 
\par          15    represent that.
\par 
\par          16              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  What is a
\par 
\par          17    reasonable assumption about what probability
\par 
\par          18    they assign to what target and they could do
\par 
\par          19    it backwards.  Of course, that is a very
\par 
\par          20    simple model with expectations and
\par 
\par          21    uncertainty.  But that is -- I think that is
\par 
\par          22    a hard problem for everyone.

\par           1              This is actually one of the big
\par 
\par           2    debates on the ICCC scenarios.  What do you
\par 
\par           3    mean by based on this scenario, given that
\par 
\par           4    some countries have explicit climate policy,
\par 
\par           5    some are in progress, lot of it is being
\par 
\par           6    implemented, some aren't.  It is actually
\par 
\par           7    felt that that is a huge source of
\par 
\par           8    uncertainly and what people call baselines,
\par 
\par           9    because they make different assumptions.
\par 
\par          10    Sometimes they know they are making different
\par

\par

\par

\par 
\par          14    something more elaborate than that.  But just

\par

\par 
\par           4    something that is resource limitation.  Or
\par 
\par           5    limiting investigation.  But the question is

\par

\par 
\par           9              MR. GRUENSPECHT:  You raised that
\par 
\par          10    half of one percent.
\par 
\par          11              MR. KOKKELENBERG:  Yeah, is that --
\par 
\par          12    is that a key?  Is the coal market that
\par 
\par          13    sensitive?  Then half of one percent in some
\par 
\par          14    things is an extremely important thing
\par 
\par          15    because the way the market is traded and
\par
