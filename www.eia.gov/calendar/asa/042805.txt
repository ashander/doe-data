          2              DR. HENGARTNER:  Ladies and

          3    gentlemen, members of the committee, members

          4    of the audience, this is the first meeting of

          5    our committee since it was determined that we

          6    are not covered by the provisions of the

          7    Federal Advisory Committee Act.  The DOE's

          8    Office of General Counsel has reexamined the

          9    statute of the Committee and advised that

         10    only committee subjected to the department's

         11    actual management or control are covered by

         12    the act.  And in fact it does absolutely

         13    change nothing for us in the way our

         14    committee is working.  So this is simply how

         15    we're perceived by the DOE.  It's not

         16    internal on how we're working and how we're

         17    appointed and so on.  So this should be

         18    transparent to all of us except for

         19    management.

         20              Moving to the real agenda, let me

         21    remind you that this is an ASA Committee, as

         22    is obvious and not an EIA committee, which

          1    periodically provides input and advice to the

          2    EIA.  This meeting is open to the public and

          3    public comments are welcome.  Time will be

          4    set aside at the end of each day and morning

          5    and afternoon for public comments.  All

          6    attendees, EIA employees and committee

          7    members and members of the public, should

          8    sign the sign-in sheet at the entrance and

          9    please write down your phone number and

         10    e-mail.

         11              The other thing I would like to let

         12    you know, there are restrooms.  If you go out

         13    of the door in to the hallway you turn to the

         14    left and it's at the end of it.  That's

         15    important for the new committee members.

         16    There is also a telephone here.  We will come

         17    to that in a minute.  There is also a

         18    telephone feed here if anybody needs to have

         19    someone call you.  The telephone number, I am

         20    giving it you, it's 202-586-3071 or 586-6273

         21    or 586-6202.  Now, you don't need to remember

         22    these numbers.  I have them written down

          3              Kathleen Wert is in charge of the

          4    ASA and is helping the committee members with

          5    reimbursement and other logistical questions

          6    and she has a new help, Margarita Navos, who

          7    will be helping her in that respect.  On the

          8    technical side each committee member is asked

          9    to speak loudly and clearly, to articulate,

         10    and please speak in the microphone such that

         11    the recorder here can actually help in his

         12    transcriptions.  Now, finally before we start

         13    I would like to welcome our two new committee

         14    members, Cutler Cleveland from Boston.

         15    Welcome.

         16    much for introducing yourself.  Nancy here is

         17    very important to this meeting because she is

         18    the designated federal officer.  That means

         19    that she must attend the meetings and she

         20    may, if she wants, chair the meeting or call

         21    a stop to the meeting if she deems it

         22    necessary, and she must approve all the

          3    important.

          4              MS. KIRKENDALL:  The only thing is

          5    that's probably not true any more because I

          6    think that's a FACA thing.

          7              DR. HENGARTNER:  Now that I've

          8    painted you in such a good light, Nancy.

          9              I think this is going to be a good

         10    meeting.  I looked at the agenda that Nancy

         11    provided and this looks like a really

         12    interesting meeting.  I think the last few

         13    meetings generally have been superb.  I hope

         14    that this will continue and I hope that we

         15    are all going to come away with some good

         16    recommendations and some advice that will be

         17    useful for the EIA.

         18              So I will be the taskmaster.  I

         19    will keep you on schedule.  That means we are

         20    10 minutes late as we are.  Guy Caruso will

         21    give a talk about the state of EIA.

         22    Unfortunately he is looking for his slides

          1    and therefore Nancy Kirkendall will start as

          2    presenter.

          3              I think we are going to switch

          4    Nancy and Guy and Nancy will start if that's

          5    all right with you.  And the other feature

          6    for this morning is short-term range in

          7    forecasting systems and most importantly I

          8    want to remind the committee members there is

          9    lunch provided, so the economists are wrong,

         10    there is a free lunch, and it is going to be

         11    located in the usual room, which is EA 226 on

         12    the first floor.  So you want to start,

         13    Nancy?

         14              MS. KIRKENDALL:  As Nick said, we

         15    are no longer under FACA.  There are new

         16    rules by the government ethics office.  That

         17    is why we got out from under FACA and they

         18    were that the ASA president appoints members

         19    and it's true we make recommendations but he

         20    still sneaks a member sometimes but that is

         21    more little challenges in communication than

         22    anything else.

          1              And then the other main reason was

          2    that we do not ask the committee to provide

          3    consensus recommendations.  We want your

          4    technical recommendations and when of course

          5    you all chime in and agree that carries more

          6    weight than if it's one voice but we really

          7    do like to hear a variety of opinions and, as

          8    Nick said, we don't expect to operate any

          9    differently than we have in the past.  We

         10    thought it has worked pretty well so we do

         11    not see any reason to.

         12              So my purpose today is to give you

         14    including this meeting and the next meeting.

         15    So these are topics that you are going to

         16    hear more about today.  You have heard about

         17    them in the past.  And particularly this

         18    morning we have a lot of discussion about the

         19    short-term energy outlook in the past.

         20              Phil Tseng and Dave Costello have

         21    talked about their efforts in the modeling of

         22    electricity.  This is a big effort in EIA in

          1    the past.  Our short-term energy forecasts

          2    have all been done at the national level and

          3    now we are trying to move to the regional

          4    models so we have got a lot of issues to talk

          5    about with you.

          6              Margot Anderson is going to give

          7    you background information and talk about big

          8    picture items.  Phil Tseng and Dave Costello

          9    will tell you more about where they are on

         10    the electricity regional modeling and Tanc

         11    Lidderdale will talk about all the rest of

         12    the regional modeling.  So I think that will

         13    be a very interesting session.

         14              We have also talked a lot about

         15    assessing EIA frames.  This is an item in our

         16    strategic plan is to take a look at our

         17    frames and see how good they are.  Howard

         18    Bradsher-Fredrick will be talking about the

         19    results from an EIA look at our frames.  It's

         20    really hard to have a good quantitative

         21    assessment so it had to use a little

         22    qualitative judgment in it but he will tell

          2    that.

          3              We also have our colleagues at the

          4    Census Bureau doing some comparisons of some

          5    frames and you will have an update of that.

          6    We will also have more information about that

          7    project at the fall meeting because they'll

          8    look at some of our bigger surveys.  I think

          9    today they're talking about two of our

         10    smaller surveys where they've completed the

         11    work.

         12              As a number of you have heard, we

         13    are doing usability testing of a new website

         14    design.  I think all of the committee members

         15    should be there, two separate break-out

         16    sessions so all of the committee members will

         17    get to participate in the testing, and that

         18    will be valuable information.

         19              You will hear a new talk.  This is

         20    a new talk.  Did we skip one?  I did skip

         21    one.  This is continued.  We are going to

         22    hear about the natural gas production survey.

          1    There's a new survey.  It collects monthly

          2    natural gas production.  The committee has

          3    heard a lot about how we have estimated

          4    natural gas production in the past

          5    particularly in certain states, in Texas.

          6    Randy Sitter's student did some work that we

          7    actually used.

          8              You heard about our efforts to

          9    estimate in the Gulf of Mexico where there is

         10    very little data and now what we have is a

         11    new monthly survey.  John was going to be

         12    talking about the results.  It started

         13    operation in January.  The first data are

         14    just being processed and are close to being

         15    ready to release.  So he is going to ask some

         16    advice on when do we decide that they should

         17    be our official data, how do we decide that

         18    they are accurate enough to release, and that

         19    sort of thing.

         20              826 is a monthly survey that

         21    collects information on electricity sales and

         22    resale and we are trying to work with

          2    detection, you've heard about that.  We will

          5              So this is an ongoing project and

          6    then another major effort that's going on, we

          7    talked last time about external evaluations.

          8    As we told you then, we had a poor report in

          9    the OMB's PART report.  That's a performance

         10    assessment rating tool.  They go through and

         11    ask a bunch of questions and we flunked in

         12    terms of being able to say that we have

         13    regular external reviews that look at our

         14    relevance programs, are we doing the right

         15    things, and we had two discussions last time.

         16              One was Brenda Cox talking about

         17    doing an evaluation of a survey program, and

         18    she will give us an update on that work, and

         19    the other one was even more exciting.  The

         20    committee came back and told us we needed to

         21    have a high-powered review team modeled on

         22    academic evaluations and so we actually have

          1    a plan.  We're going to go forward with it

          2    and we will hear about that on Friday too.

          3    So that one is particularly exciting.

          4              I think I covered the first one.

          5    The second bullet is declining response

          6    rates.  Our Residential Energy Consumption

          7    Survey, Dwight French, they're looking at a

          8    lot of different initiatives that might be

          9    used for improving response rates for RECS.

         10    I think one of the most interesting things is

         11    that they are going to be doing an incentive

         12    experiment with it.  They're also looking at

         13    other things that I think will be more

         14    applicable to some of our other surveys so

         15    interesting things going on there.

         16              So these are topics that you will

         17    probably hear about at the next meeting but

         18    we did not have time to squeeze them in.

         19    Either one of two things, we either did not

         20    have time to talk about them this time or we

         21    weren't ready to talk about them again.

         22              There's post-stratification for the

          1    manufacturing energy consumption survey.

          2    This is collaborative work with the Census

          3    Bureau and so they'll come back and talk to

          4    us again, at least we hope.

          5              We had a group from my office did

          6    some cognitive testing on the Form EIA 920.

          7    That's a survey that goes to basically

          8    manufacturing plants that asks about their

          9    electricity generation and consumption.  They

         10    used cognitive interviews to redesign the

         11    form and so this test is to try to figure out

         12    what was the impact of that work.  We have

         13    done a lot of work since then and hope to

         14    have a nice presentation next time.

         15              Then the last item, customer

         16    evaluations of our forecasting and analytical

         17    products, these are surveys we have talked

         18    about a couple of times.  Last year we did a

         19    survey of participants in our NEMS Conference

         20    to get an assessment of our annual and

         21    international energy outlook.

         22              In the fall we did a similar survey

          1    but we used a sample of subscribers to the

          2    list serve for the short-term energy outlook

          3    and we have decided that that methodology

          4    works better so we are going to use the same

          5    methodology in the next month or two to

          6    assess the AEO and the IEO.  One of the

          7    recommendations of the committee last time

          8    was that we should not do an annual

          9    assessment of each product and so maybe in

         10    the fall we can talk about how to schedule a

         11    rotating assessment so that we can capture

         12    things in a less burdensome manner for

         13    everybody.

         14              These are just other things that we

         15    talked about.  Work is going on, George Latey

         16    (?) is continuing his work on diagnostic

         17    modeling on NEMS solutions to try to

         18    illuminate how good the forecast are to get

         19    some sensitivity analysis for our

         20    forecasting.  Howard Bradsher-Fredrick is

         21    going to present a paper on dual system

          1    Statistical Methodologies Research

          3    that should be interesting.

          4              And then we have a session at the

          5    joint statistical meetings in August on the

          6    new natural gas production survey.  It's

          7    going to be an introduction to the problem,

          8    description of the survey methods.  We will

          9    have done an extensive simulation including

         10    the estimators that you recommended and then

         11    John will also talk about what we're doing

         12    now and how it's all going.  And that is on

         13    Wednesday at 8:30 in the morning so if you're

          2              MR. CARUSO:  There is a direct

          3    correlation between the price of gasoline and

          4    the amount of requests the EIA gets in hits

          5    on the website.  First let me congratulate

          6    you, Nick, for promotion to chairman and

          7    welcome, Cutler and Darius, to the committee.

          8    I appreciate all of your time that you put

          9    into this committee as colleagues that had

         10    been involved for a number of years.

         11              We really take your advice

         12    seriously and it clearly makes a difference

         13    in many of the things we do, as you'll see

         14    from the agenda, in some of the products that

         15    we've changed and the methodological changes

         16    we've made so a big thanks for the time you

         17    take to do this and I know the pay isn't that

         18    great.

         19              I want to talk a little bit about

         20    some of our activities since the last meeting

         21    and it's on the first slide and I think, as

         22    Nick's comment implied, when energy prices

          1    are high there is a real effect on our work,

          2    not only the day to day products like our

          3    weekly petroleum numbers, weekly natural gas

          4    numbers, but currently once again an energy

          5    bill is being debated on the Hill and we get

          6    asked to do a lot of service reports related

          7    to the bill or elements that are connected to

          8    the bill and two weeks ago we released the

          9    analysis of the National Commission on Energy

         10    Policy that was a report put out in December

         11    of '04 which makes a lot of policy

         12    recommendations, many of which go well beyond

         13    anything the Congress has actually passed or

         14    even contemplates passing like substantial

         15    increase in CAFE standards and things like

         16    that.

         17              But in any case it's an example of

         18    things we're being asked to do.  We're being

         19    asked right now to do some work for Senators

         20    Dorgan and Jeffords and Imhofe as well.  So

         21    there has been a lot of activities directly

         22    related to debates on the Hill.

          1              To answer the next question

          2    directly, the summer fuels outlook which we

          3    released two weeks ago, we say that the

          4    gasoline price is going to average $2.35 in

          5    May which will be the peak.  By Labor Day it

          6    should be down to 2.20.

          7              One of the things that occurred

          8    since our last meeting was a substantial

          9    revision in one of the weekly natural gas

         10    storage numbers, actually Thanksgiving week,

         11    and we've taken a hard look at our revisions

         12    policy on the weekly data and just yesterday

         13    on the web the Federal Register notice was

         14    released with our new revisions policy and if

         15    anyone is interested in getting into more

         16    detail I'll be happy to do that but it's

         17    another issue that I know we've discussed in

         18    this committee at that specific report about

         19    revisions policy in general, and then you'll

         20    have on the agenda the natural gas production

         21    survey which John Wood has talked to you

         22    about in previous meetings and we'll get some

          1    more reviews on that.

          2              Nancy mentioned the new development

          3    with an external study team being formed and

          4    we'll have that on the agenda some new

          5    developments with respect to the strategic

          6    plan and I'll give you a few updates on where

          7    we are with our '06 budget.  In fact this

          8    week we're meeting with all the officers to

          9    talk about '07 so the budget's clearly an

         10    important aspect of getting some of these

         11    things down that we've talked about in this

         12    committee.

         13              The next slide just talks about

         14    some of the things we've done for Congress.

         15    I mentioned some of the service reports but

         16    then there is the regular products such as

         17    the winter fuels outlook which we do every

         18    October and then the annual energy outlook in

         19    both its reference case and the full report

         20    which was released in late February.

         21              We are working on the international

         22    energy outlook now and will have that out by

          1    early July.  This next slide shows a couple

          2    of these service reports, one on the mercury

          3    controls that Senators Imhofe and Voinovich

          4    requested.  I mentioned the National

          5    Commission on Energy Policy already.  That

          6    was requested by Senator Bingaman and there

          7    are a couple of others in the pipeline now.

          8              So I think the main point here is

          9    that EIA is being asked to do even more on

         10    what-if scenarios with respect to the current

         11    energy bill and other energy policy changes

         12    that are being contemplated and the modeling

         13    and other techniques that have come before

         14    this committee are being used extensively.

         15              I already talked a little bit about

         16    this, the average price for the summer, 2.28

         17    with a peak in May.  Of course, it seems to

         18    have gotten more political attention.  The

         19    President's speech yesterday clearly was an

         20    example of that and, of course, the bill was

         21    passed by the House.  The House version, HR

         22    6, was passed last week.  The Senate will

          3    conference so that the President can sign it

          4    by August, that's the goal.

          5              The next one again talks about how

          6    often we are being asked to provide data and

          7    an analysis not only to Congress but the

          8    administration and certainly lots of press

          9    attention and our products continue to be

         10    heavily used by the financial community and I

         11    think we talked about last time that there

         12    are actually now derivatives based on the

         13    actual numbers that the EIA releases on a

         14    weekly basis.

         15              You can bet on what our natural gas

         16    number's going to be at 10:30 this morning.

         17    An actual financial instrument has been

         18    created and is now up and running and we were

         19    concerned about what impact that might have

         20    and I think the main impact we have seen so

         21    far is this very close scrutiny to the

         22    numbers and any kind of deviation.  For

          1    example, the large revision I mentioned in

          2    the week of Thanksgiving last year created a

          3    huge stir and any time there is any kind of a

          4    technical problem where the numbers are even

          5    two minutes late from 10:30 we get a huge

          6    amount of criticism from the media.

          7              So I think for us as an

          8    organization managing the information system

          9    what it's done is put on more pressure for

         10    both not only accuracy but timeliness and

         11    things like revisions policy, which one

         12    wouldn't think would get that much attention,

         13    was a subject of a lot of trade journal

         14    attention which I think in the long run is

         15    good as long as the resources are there to

         16    deal with it.

         17              The real problem is increased

         19    timeliness, even more attention to data

         20    quality, which, as you know, in this

         21    committee we pay a lot of attention to under

         11    as you know from past discussions in this

          1    Nancy, this was the outcome of the PART

          2    process.  Our OMB review downgraded us

          3    because we have not had an independent review

          4    of the full EIA program by outside experts.

          5              We have had a number of independent

          6    expert reviews on specific issues,

          7    methodologies, and other more narrowly

          8    focused reviews.  There was a National

          9    Academy Study in '91, but that was really

         10    focused on NEMS so even that NAS wasn't a

         11    full program review.  So what we have done is

         12    we have established a concept for an external

         13    study team of five very senior people.  Up to

         14    now and I think I'd be announcing to the

         15    public for the first time that Denny Ellerman

         16    of MIT will chair that study team and he will

         17    be the one selecting the other four team

         18    members so there is indeed truly an

         19    independent set of experts, and that will be

         20    on the agenda later on so I won't go into any

          1    about that, a number of other meetings.  We

          2    have added a fourth goal which started out as

          3    an IT, information technology, goal but as it

          4    evolved it certainly has broadened to include

          5    a number of other cross-cutting issues and we

          6    will be discussing with you some of those

          7    issues in more detail.  The next slide shows

          8    some of the things.

          9              Four groups have been established

         10    within EIA to discuss survey frames, IDC,

         11    Internet data collection, things like

         12    disclosure limitations and database

         13    commonality and I think what's particularly

         14    interesting about this is that there is a

         15    great deal of interoffice cooperation on this

         16    goal 4 and we see lots of opportunity for

         17    improvements of efficiencies and the number

         18    of things that we've been hoping to use the

         19    IT goal to lead to so I think from the

         20    perspective of the managers we're looking

         21    forward to implementing that goal 4.

          1    $86 million request before Congress for FY

          2    '06 and the House Energy and Water Committee,

          3    which as of this budget our budget was moved

          4    from Interior to Energy and Water so now we

          5    are in the same budget as all of DOE except

          6    for the weapons and NSA part of DOE and so

          7    this will be a new process for us, a new set

          8    of Congressional members to deal with, and I

          9    have been spending a lot of time up there

         10    meeting with many of the members of the House

         11    Energy and Water Committee and they are going

         12    to mark up our budget, I believe, May 12 is

         13    the latest date I heard.  So we are hopeful

         14    that roughly 86 million, 85.9, is about a

         15    $2-million increase over FY '05.

         16              And a number of specific things

         17    around the board, they were about what's in

         18    this request for '06.  We want to fund the

         19    consumption surveys.  We have been trying to

         20    get by with a minimal amount of funding and

         21    we've decided that it is affecting the

          4    security has clearly become even more

          5    important and in particular with the

          6    increased sensitivity of the weekly petroleum

          8    more money on that in '06.

         11    Edmonds knows better than anyone else in the

          1              MR. CARUSO:  Well, there are some

          2    economists in here.  In the short run it's

          3    probably not much of an upper limit but in

          4    our long-term outlook we have raised the

          5    expectation where oil prices are going and

          6    it's partly because of the increased cost of

          7    finding and developing crude but in the short

          8    run the real issue is that there is hardly

          9    any unused productive capacity in the world

         10    so there is no cushion to deal with shocks to

         11    the system other than strategic petroleum

         12    reserve and that, of course, is limited.  So

         13    in the upper bound there has been a report in

         14    recent weeks from Goldman Sachs using $105

         15    per barrel price.

         16              If you put any price there in the

         17    short run I think the real answer is at some

         18    point there would have to be some reaction to

         19    use the SPR to invoke the IEA short-term

         20    response system so we have a statistical

         21    boundary on our short term and the STEO does

         22    that every month but I think that's a 95

         17    want to set a new band partly because no one

         18    knows where the price is going to settle out

         19    so I'm not sure when or if OPEC will

         20    reestablish that band.

          1    comments seem to be they're thinking in the

          5              We did in the AEO this year

          7    because some people thought it might be too

          8    politically sensitive, look at what the OPEC

          9    revenues would be under various price bands

         10    and what it showed was three high price cases

         11    above the reference case.  In two of those

         12    cases the OPEC revenues were higher at lower

          4    everyone.  Thank you for having me.  It's a

          5    pleasure to speak with you all day about two

          6    topics very close to my heart and the

          7    business that I am required to do within EIA.

          8    I am relatively new to EIA and I get to

          9    oversee many of the activities that you are

         10    going to hear about today which deal with the

         11    short-term outlook and the quadrennial

         12    surveys as well.  I want to talk today a bit

         13    about the project we have underway to

         14    regionalize our short-term energy outlook.

         15              I think in ASA meetings in the past

         16    you have had a presentation on various

         17    components.  I want to put the rewind button

         18    on and go back and do an overview of what

         19    we're trying to accomplish and why we're

         20    regionalizing and what some of the challenges

         21    are.

          1    from some of the folks that are very deep in

          3    electricity component of the regional steel

          4    and you'll hear, I believe, about the propane

          5    component and other components as well.

          6              With us in the room are several of

          7    the folks intimately involved with regional

          8    steel, Mark Rodekohr over here who is leading

          9    the charge, I see Tanc here and Phil and Dave

         10    Costello and I am sure there are others but I

         11    haven't put my glasses on.  So when we get to

         12    any question that I can't answer, I know that

         13    they will help me out.

         17    overview of the actual model and the key

         18    components of the model so you can see how it

         19    all fits together, and then I want to briefly

         20    address some of the challenges that we're

         21    facing as we move from a national model to a

         22    regional model, might I say, at the same

          1    time.  A lot of the work that we're doing to

          2    regionalize this model is occurring while

          3    we're putting out the monthly short term

          4    energy outlook, all done with about the same

          5    staff, and it has presented quite a challenge

          6    to us to be going back and forth from the

          7    building of the regional to putting out the

          8    monthly actual outlook.

          9              Why are we doing this?  What is our

         10    purpose and what are our objectives?  We got

         11    into this about mid-2003 and the objective is

         12    to maintain a national perspective while

         13    providing some regional richness to our

         14    short-term outlook.  For years we've been

         15    presenting just the national numbers but we

         16    know that the national number isn't fully

         17    representative of what's going on in each of

         18    the regions and so we would like to be able

         19    to tell folks in the northeast or the

         20    southwest or in California why they might be

         21    facing a different set of energy prices, how

         22    their demands are different vis-à-vis the

          1    entire US demand level or against each other

          2    in the regions.

          3              So it provides the kind of richness

          4    that we often get asked about when people say

          5    what's going on in my area, what's going on

          6    in my State, how can you tell me something

          7    more about how it will affect me as opposed

          8    to a national average, so it provides this

          9    richness and relevance to what we think key

         10    customers want.  In addition it adds this

         11    depth.  We gain a better understanding of

         12    local regional supply problems.  By zeroing

         13    in and looking at what's happening in these

         14    regions it helps inform the national

         15    perspective as well.

         16              So it provides a whole new set of

         17    options for us to look at where there may be

         18    problems that we want to zero in on whether

         19    on the demand side or on the supply side.  It

         20    may add, and the caveat here is may, accuracy

         21    to the national level estimates.

         22              It's not clear to us at this time

          3    using the national model that we do now but

          4    we do think that by adding this regional

          5    richness we may add some improved accuracy to

          6    the national level forecast and I'm going to

          8    second presentation today.

          9              So this is some of the motivation

         10    for why we got into this.  Let me review the

         11    schedule with you.  Again, we began in

         12    mid-2003 and we are scheduled for completion

         13    in late summer of 2005.  What are we doing

         14    now?  We're continuing to do the model

         15    development.  The very large part of doing

         16    the regional model is dealing with the

         17    electricity side of the model and that's why

         18    we're spending so much time on it and why

         19    you're going to hear about it in much more

         20    detail today.

         21              So we're undergoing model

         22    development.  Certainly testing goes on all

          1    the time as we build modules and we preparing

          2    the documentation.  So in essence we're going

          3    through a testing period, we're going to have

          4    expert review of the documentation, and we

          5    want to go live in late summer 2005.

          6              We've got a lot of issues about how

          7    we communicate what we're doing to the

          8    public.  We want to continue, of course, the

          9    monthly release of a short-term energy

         10    outlook.  What will that look like?  Will it

         11    be more extensive than what we're doing now?

         12    Well, sure, we're going to have a lot more

         13    tables associated with the regional

         14    components of the model.  How much that

         15    translates into a textual description of

         16    what's going on is still undecided yet, how

         17    much do we expand or contract or reformulate

         18    the actual short-term outlook that you see.

         19    It clearly is a lot more information but

         20    trying to organize it in a way that will be

         21    useful to the readership is an open question.

         10    in some version but this is again an open

         18    additional information in an improved format,

         19    i.e., a query system, that allows the

          2              So by adding this great deal of

          3    complexity of the model we suspect that we

          4    will have an increased number of customers

          5    who are interested in the regional component

          6    and how we present that information for

          7    consumption is a big issue for us.  Clearly

          8    we will provide all the documentation as we

          9    get it expert reviewed and available to those

         10    folks that are interested in looking at the

         11    specifics of what we did.

         12              I suspect that while we will go

         13    live we will continue to upgrade this model

         14    over time.  I don't think that once we're

         15    done we're done.  It will be an evolutionary

         16    process of refining the model as we get

         17    comment back and as we understand how people

         18    are using it and as we can improve our access

         19    and analysis of the data.  So I'd like to

         20    look at it as evolutionary with big points at

         21    which we release things to the public.

          1    covered but I think most of you know that the

          2    system that we use now, the STIF system, is

          3    moving to the RSTEM system, which expands on

          4    the STIF systems to include these regional

          5    demand and price determinants for most energy

          6    products.  It's an econometric model that

          7    captures demand, inventories, prices, and

          8    it's used to forecast the things that Guy was

          9    talking about earlier.  It's used to support

         10    the monthly outlook and it's used to support

         11    the summer fuels and the winter fuels outlook

         12    as well which will continue now with regional

         13    richness.

         14              RSTEM will allow more detail

         15    treatment of the trends in the regions far

         16    more than was possible under STIFS.  The

         17    frequency of the outlook will remain the

         18    same.  I should have mentioned that, I think,

         19    in the previous slide.  We are not going to a

         20    longer or a shorter forecast period.  We're

         21    still going with the 12- to 24-month look

         22    ahead.  So that will stay the same under the

          2    about forecast for the three to five-year

          3    period.  This model is not it; it is a

          4    short-term energy outlook model.

          5              What are the components of the

          6    model?  The components are similar to what

          7    they are now only they're regionalized and it

          8    makes it a whole lot more complicated and I

          9    have a slide in a minute to demonstrate just

         10    how more complicated it is.  We have the

         11    electricity side that looks at demand prices,

         12    low generation, and dispatch model.  Phil's

         13    going to be talking about this later today.

         14    A natural gas component that's looking at

         15    prices in storage, supply, and demand, a

         16    petroleum component looking at heating oil,

         17    gasoline, propane in a macro bridge.

         18              This is a gross simplification of

         19    what's going on.  There's a tremendous amount

         20    of detail for each one of these components.

         21    Some are more regional than others, some are

         22    more detailed than others, some go from a

          1    national level and allocate out to a regional

          2    or state level, and some build back up.  It's

          3    not the case that every component in this

          4    model is a bottom-up approach.  There's a

          5    mixture and a back and forth between national

          6    and regional components.  Not all the regions

          7    are the same for each sector.

          8              The degree of regionalization

          9    varies considerably.  We have significant

         10    regional detail and data for some components

         11    of this model but not for others.  And so in

         12    some cases we can get down to more regions

         13    and in other cases we are constrained by our

         14    ability to have the data necessary to support

         15    the kind of forecasting we think is

         16    appropriate in this case.  So you will see

         17    significant detail in the natural gas and

         18    electricity side of the model, less so for

         19    some petroleum products and for some end

         20    uses.

         21              So there is a varying degree of

         22    regionalization.  I think that's critical to

          1    remember that not all regions will get the

          2    same level of detail that they may be

          3    expecting by going to a regional model.  It

          4    will vary tremendously based on the data

          5    requirements and the data needs and the data

          6    quality that we have for the different end

          7    uses and for the different markets.

          8              This is a little graphic that shows

          9    you that in the STIFS model we're dealing

         10    with about 1300 variables and we add up the

         11    variables of what we got to keep track of.

         12    This is not just the variables that are being

         13    forecast.  These are the variables and the

         14    data that we got to keep track of within the

         15    model to a model that's looking at about

         16    15,000, almost 16,000, variables.  The level

         17    of complexity has increased many, many times

         18    over.

         19              So it's a much more complicated

         20    model and the data requirements are huge and

         21    a lot of the issues that we deal with are

         22    really on the data side as opposed to on the

          4    want them at the time we need them, and these

          5    are all issues that we have to grapple with

          6    not only within our office but we are

          7    dependent upon others within EIA to get the

          9    to make sure that they make it into the

         10    monthly model.  So there's a lot of

         11    logistical problems that show up in moving

         12    from a more simplified national model to this

          5    in sample forecasts and that they are

          6    accurately predicting the future.  Once you

         12    complexities in the second half of my

         13    discussion today.

         14              Clearly there are lots of

         15    challenges with upgrading the model and

         16    moving to a much more complicated system.  As

         17    I've said three or four times already, the

         18    electricity side is really the most

         19    complicated, the most detailed information

         20    that is available, and the most complicated

         21    type of modeling that we do is in the

         22    electricity sector of trying to determine low

          3    Phil and several others that are leading us

          4    through this.

          5              Another problem is avoiding

          6    aggregation errors.  When we're adding up

          7    from a lot of different pieces there are

          8    problems associated with whether what you get

          9    at the top level doesn't contain all the

         10    biases that you might be embedding in each of

         11    the individual systems or the individual data

         12    and equations.

         13              Maintaining model and data quality

         14    is another big issue.  When we're talking

         15    about as many variables as we are it takes a

         16    considerable amount of resources to check for

         17    measurement errors and data quality, on a

         18    monthly basis and to try and build into this

         19    system diagnostics to make sure that you're

         20    not making gross errors in data is a key part

         21    of this.  A single person or a couple of

          8              I talked earlier about augmenting

         10    challenge that we will have as we move

         11    forward and interact with our customers and

         12    with analysts about how to improve the model

         15    some time in the future and talk about how

         16    we're going to ask people in a more formal

         17    basis how are we doing, how's it doing, how's

         18    the model doing, and is it doing what you

         19    want it to do, and is it as good as what we

         20    were doing before when we just had the

         21    national model so assessment will be a big

         22    part of our going forward program.

          1              Obviously we need to develop

          2    appropriate diagnostic and model evaluation

          3    tools.  I alluded to this in talking about

          4    model and data quality but model evaluation

          5    tools are also critical and it's really the

          6    issue that I want to get to in my next talk

          7    about best practices for evaluating forecasts

          8    in general and in essence to solicit some

          9    advice on what we ought to be doing to

         10    develop a program in EIA certainly within the

         11    regional model that helps us gauge forecast

         12    accuracy and do a report card on ourselves as

         13    well as be able to compare ourselves with

         14    other forecasters to get a sense of how we

         15    might improve the model based on some

         16    diagnostics and some forecast accuracy tools

         17    that really ought to be a part of our core

         18    program.

         19              So I would like to end this

         20    presentation and maybe answer a few questions

         21    or go into the next one.  What do you want me

          3    pieces.  It allows the public and the members

          8    questions it's a good time.  Yes?

          9              DR. NEERCHAL:  I'm sure the data

         10    quality and the availability vary from region

         11    to region quite a bit.  Was that also part of

         13    of regionalization?

         14              MS. ANDERSON:  Sure, particularly

         15    availability, yes, it was, and I don't know

         16    what more to say about that but certainly the

         17    data quality and the data availability have a

         18    lot to do with whether you're breaking it

         19    down by PADD regions or whether you can get

         20    down to some state level data for some

         21    components of the model.  And we hope that

         22    supply might create its own demand or that by

         10    regional?

         11              MS. ANDERSON:  Well, depending on

         12    the sector you're looking at it can get real

         13    bad.  I mean, in many ways we're aggregating

         14    up from not very good data, aggregation

         15    problems.  In other cases we're just using a

         16    much more aggregated number and parsing out

         17    by what we know about demand or supply in

         18    individual regions.  We don't really have any

         19    regional richness but we may have to infer in

          8              MS. ANDERSON:  Well, in terms of

          9    output I think we're going to focus on the

         10    kinds of things we do now in the national

         11    model, prices, demands, supply.  I mean,

         12    right now what we report out in monthly are a

         13    long conversation about what we think the

         14    prices are going to be for natural gas,

         15    petroleum products, electricity, coal, and we

         16    also have a discussion on the demands for

         17    each, somewhat less discussion on supply for

         18    each of those fuels although we usually have

         19    in a paragraph or two about world oil

         20    balances because that seems to be a primary

         21    focus.

          1    question for me about whether the shift in

          2    the emphasis will change when we go from

          3    national to regional.  Right now our focus is

          4    really on oil markets and has been for some

          5    time lately because of all the increases but

          6    it may be that customers are going to want to

          7    rebalance our emphasis in a sense of looking

          8    at spending more time looking at regional

          9    breakouts of prices as opposed to a discourse

         10    on the national level.

         11              So the outputs will be generally

         12    the same.  They'll just be more detail on

         13    them and so we would be able to look at

         14    gasoline or propane prices by our regions and

         15    be able to let customers know that if you're

         16    living on the west coast your gas price path

         17    is likely to look different than if you're

         18    living in the southeast.

         19              In terms of the input to the model

         20    the numbers are similar.  The information

         21    that you need to predict it at a regional

         22    level is similar to what you need at the

          5    get at what you're asking?

          6              MR. EDMONDS:  Actually I was just

          7    thinking if you could enumerate the key

          8    drivers to the short term forecast.  You've

          9    got some big benchmarking drivers like you're

         10    macro-economic variables coming in but then

         11    what are the other things that you're going

         12    to be looking for on the outside to drive the

         13    development of price forecast?

         16              MR. RODEKOHR:  Yes, there are

         17    several factors.  One is weather.  Clearly if

         18    we have a national weather forecast that it's

         19    going to be a normal winter --

          2              MR. RODEKOHR:  There are several

          3    factors and the weather is one of them.  For

          4    example, you can have a national weather

          5    forecast that says it will be normal for the

          6    winter; however, that masks regional

          7    differences, colder in the northeast,

          8    whatever the case may be.  So that can and

          9    has made an impact on average prices for the

         10    country and certainly prices in regions and

         11    we've known this for years now.  That's one

         12    factor.

         13              Another factor is regional

         14    differences in prices with related things

         15    like gasoline.  Refinery outages here and

         16    there can make a difference.  We're not

         17    tracking every refinery outage for every week

         18    but nevertheless you can have some

         19    differences.

         20              In terms of electricity it's

         21    transmission constraints, it's distribution

         22    constraints.  For example, you have first run

          2    dispatching into four categories roughly.

          3    First of all you're going to use all your

          4    hydro.  You're going to use all your

          5    renewables, which is next to nothing.

          6              First the real issue on electricity

          7    dispatching is what you do with coal, oil,

          8    and natural gas and those depend on relative

          9    prices and a lot of other factors and we're

         10    trying to get a handle on that.  And that's

         11    probably the biggest cost part of the

         12    regional STEO is trying to get handle on

         13    that.  We're also focusing on four states,

          4    whole lot about that but we are trying to

          5    look at regional macro components as well.

          6    Clearly some of the industries are obviously

          7    affected differently by higher energy prices

          8    in other industries and those are very

          9    regional in nature and we are trying to get a

         10    better handle on that as well.  As Margot

         11    said, whether this leads to a better national

         12    forecast is one issue.

         13              The other issue is can this lead to

         14    a better forecast in terms of what policy

         16    the key considerations that we're after

         18    about what happens in their particular region

         19    or part of the country and that's what we're

          2    clearly when you look at the press, when you

          3    look at the policy issues, they're not all

          5    to --

          6              MS. ANDERSON:  Are there other

          7    questions?  John?

          8              MR. WOOD:  Do I have to come to the

          9    mic?

         10              MR. RODEKOHR:  The mic's over

         11    there, by the way.

         12              MR. WOOD:  I would just mention

         13    that a component that we've looked out a lot

         14    in the last five years, natural gas, detail

         15    of the quality, how well you have to know

         16    some of the inputs to have a good chance at

         17    really capturing natural gas prices, for

         18    example, is amazingly what, tight.  It looked

         19    like just a couple of percent difference

         20    between natural gas supply and demand moved

         21    the natural gas price from $9 an MCF to 2 in

         22    the 2001-'2 period and you can get a feel for

          1    what moves it and then where the natural gas

          2    supply might be on a regional basis would

          3    have given you a lot of insight.  During that

          4    period of time there was plenty of natural

          5    gas supply in the Rocky Mountains but there

          6    were shortfalls in the Gulf of Mexico with

          7    the main distribution system is so I think

          8    that idea of the regionalization gives you a

          9    lot better insight into how ————————————

         10              MS. ANDERSON:  Well, I hope so.

         11    It's a be careful what you ask for kind of a

         12    thing.  We're going to have a lot more to say

         13    about what's going on in the country and the

         14    pressure to be as accurate and timely as

         15    possible has increased considerably so

         16    there's just a lot more to look at and I

         17    think there are lot more sensitivities when

         18    you are looking at it on a regional or state

         19    basis than there would at a national level.

         20    So it's going to be a very interesting year.

          1              MR. BERNSTEIN:  More concerns and

          2    observations and I know you realize I'm

          3    really concerned about that 16,000 number

          4    down there.  I'm sure we'll get into it with

          5    Phil because the bulk of that is the 12,000

          6    dispatch number but that's a real concern on

          7    a monthly basis to be able to keep track of

          8    things and make sure they're consistent.  I

          9    know you realize that but I just needed to

         10    say it.

         11              I do believe you're in the right

         12    direction on disaggregating regionally.

         13    We're doing some work now on regional

         14    disaggregation of price elasticities and we

         15    see significant differences between regions.

         16    So it will clearly affect forecast but the

         17    other observation I want to make is more of a

         18    broader policy issue in EIA is the problem of

         19    forecasting versus assessing the risks of

         20    problems.

         21              What I would want to get out of a

         22    regional short-term energy outlook are things

          1    like what's the risk in southern California

          2    of having blackouts this summer, assessing

          3    the risks next winter in the northeast of

          4    having significantly higher heating oil

          5    prices, things like that as opposed to a

          6    forecast which no matter how good we are at

          7    forecasting we know there are problems but

          8    more in a sense of what are the conditions

          9    likely to lead to problems so that we can

         10    have red flag signals.

         11              It's the same issue I have with the

         12    annual energy outlook too but I think it's

         13    more relevant for the short term energy

         14    outlook and so I'd like you to be thinking

         15    about and considering a different approach to

         16    presenting the information and evaluating

         17    options and I think there are hot point

         18    things that are problems and there are

         19    regions where there aren't any problems and

         20    you can change your efforts to emphasize

         21    things where you notice there are going to be

         22    problems versus places that are not.

          4              MS. ANDERSON:  I think that's a

          5    great point.  We certainly tend to do more

          6    risk assessment on the international oil

          7    side.  We do choke point analysis, et cetera.

          8    We do at DOE we have an office of energy

          9    assurance, energy transmission and assurance

         10    I think it just changed it's name to, that

         11    was an office that came out of the first term

         12    of the Bush administration to assess

         13    vulnerabilities to the energy system and

         14    certainly they do some of that work.  Whether

         16    like this to identify where there might be

         17    these kinds of constraints certainly would be

         18    worth looking into.

          2    because they may be assessing other kinds of

          3    threats as well but you're right.  I don't

          4    think you'd find a published place where you

          5    could put a probability although the policy

          6    office used to do some of that as well of

          7    trying to assess where there may be working

          8    with NERC to look at the summer electricity

          9    outlook but you're right.  There's no

         10    systematic way of doing that and it's not

         11    model based.  So the points well taken that

         12    models may be able to be used for that and

         13    then what is the obligation of an EIA of

         14    putting that kind of information, making it

         15    that available.  It's a good point.

         16              MR. BERNSTEIN:  The key is that

         17    just there's nobody out there responsible for

         18    noting that there may be problems out in the

         19    future.  The only place that actually has

         20    that information is EIA.

          1              MR. BERNSTEIN:  NERC's stuff is

          2    pretty poor.  My one anecdote example is in

          3    2000-2001 time frame in California when NERC

          4    said that there are going to be no problems

          5    in California in the next six months and then

          6    all hell broke loose.

          9    forecast well.

         10              MR. CLEVELAND:  Just a brief

         11    comment to follow up on Mark's, I think that

         12    once you demonstrate this capability to do

         13    this regional type of work you will be given

         14    this kind of work because in essence the

         15    special requests you get are often regionally

         16    driven, many of them, and so now all of a

         17    sudden if you are going to be able to say

         18    things specifically about the California

         19    electricity market or the New England heat

         20    oil market you're going to get requests from

         21    people from those regions to do this type of

          1              I think Mark's point is a good one

          2    that should you be doing it pro-actively I

          3    think is an important issue to discuss but

          4    you'll be doing a lot more of that type of

          5    work and you're going to be under even more

          6    scrutiny because you're going to be saying

          7    things that are with a lot more specificity

          8    and as soon as you start saying things with a

          9    lot more specificity your models or your

         10    numbers are going to be scrutinized even more

         11    closely so be ready.

         12              MS. ANDERSON:  Dave, Tanc, anything

         13    you want to add to that?  Mark?

         14              MR. RODEKOHR:  I'd like to add a

         15    little bit to that.  Two things I think

         16    you've said, I think Mark has made a very

         17    good point in the sense that we could add to

         18    our STEO I won't say a model-based assessment

         19    of risk but where we think things could

         20    potentially be problems and I see no problem

         21    with that at all because we know what it is.

         22    Is it based on a model?  Maybe yes, maybe no.

          1              Setting expectations for the

          2    regional model, I think, is very important

          3    and the things you just said are the things

          4    that we're going to need most.  We do not

          5    have transmission link models embedded in

          6    this.  We have a regional forecast but we

          7    don't have all the transmission links.

          8              And we've already, trust me, been

          9    getting many questions about if pipeline goes

         10    down for X number of days what's going to

         11    happen to the world and we keep trying to

         12    answer these questions but we don't have a

         13    modeling technique to do it.  So I think we

         14    need to set our expectations better but I

         15    agree with you.  A risk assessment is saying

         16    in a summer or winter outlook what are the

         17    problems we think could happen not based

         18    necessarily on a modeling exercise because we

         19    do not have the detail of a NEMS or another

         20    huge model that looks at all the

         21    transportation links.  We never pretended

         22    that we had this is not a bad idea at all.

          8              Our projections are monthly.  Often

          9    times events happen that last a few days or a

         10    week.  We have no way of knowing those few

         11    days or a week in a modeling exercise are

         12    going to happen so we need to tailor our

         13    product to what they need but nevertheless

         14    never over-promise at the same time.  But the

         15    notion of a risk assessment, I think, at

         16    certain times a year is not a bad idea at all

         17    but we have not simply buried in certain

         18    sentences or paragraphs some of that stuff.

         19              MR. EDMONDS:  A quick point of

         20    clarification here, one of your slides when

         21    you did the variable count you distinguished

         22    between econometric and dispatch variables.

          1    I know what an econometric variable is but

          2    what's a dispatch variable?

          3              MS. ANDERSON:  Phil, help me.

          4              MR. TSENG:  I'll spend ————————

          5    minutes with you.

          6              MS. ANDERSON:  And on the numbers

          7    that 12,000 number may go down considerably

          8    if we can find a way to streamline on this

          9    dispatch model.  So we throw that up to

         10    demonstrate where we are now, having to track

         11    all that.

         12              MR. EDMONDS:  So what it's saying

         13    is that that's an electricity dispatch?

         14              MS. ANDERSON:  Yes, it is,

         15    electricity --

         16              MR. EDMONDS:  And basically it's

         17    all coming in from outside?

         18              MS. ANDERSON:  Well, all coming in

         19    on that one component of the model that's

         20    dealing with trying to find the optimal way

         21    that the plant just sends out the power at

         22    what time.  And we have all this plant data

          3    getting electricity when based on demands and

          1    here isn't to beat ourselves up if we're not

          2    perfect every month.

          3              The idea about doing this is just

          4    to get a better sense of how we can improve

          5    our own models by coming up with a program

          6    that continually allows us to assess what

          7    we're doing and what's the appropriate report

          8    card that we ought to use.  So I want to talk

          9    a bit about past and current practice,

         10    principles and tools for forecast evaluation,

         11    and some things we're thinking about as we

         12    consider designing a good practices program

         13    for assessing our forecast.

         14              Well, I've hinted at why evaluate.

         15    I mean, to many this is an obvious thing to

         16    do.  We want to assess the accuracy of what

         17    we're doing, we want to improve the data in

         18    the models, we want to enhance accuracy and

         19    credibility, we want to increase

         20    transparency, we want to help demonstrate the

         21    complexity of forecasting.

          2    communicate why you might not be doing it as

          3    well as some people think you ought to be

          4    doing it who are not in the game.  Having

          5    said all of this, it's not so easy just to

          6    come up and say here are a couple of tools

          7    and if you just do this every month you'll be

          8    better off and you can tell people you're 20

         10              It's using the information to

         11    evaluate what you're doing and it's not

         12    looking at all 12,000, 1400, whatever it is,

         13    number of variables.  It's really designing a

         14    program that looks at some key things that

         15    can really help you better understand what

         16    you're doing within the models and why or why

         17    not you may be missing what the actual

         18    outcome is and there may be obviously some

         19    really good reasons that you're not going to

         20    ever capture within a model.

         21              But I think there is an impetus to

         22    do this at varying levels.  You can have a

          2    and it's deciding which program would be best

          3    under this context.  During the '80s and the

          4    early '90s we routinely published an annual

          5    supplement to what was then a quarterly

          6    short-term outlook model and we put out a

          7    series of forecast errors and looked at some

          8    key variables and said here's how we're doing

          9    and here's why it's different than what it

         10    actually was and explained what might have

         11    been going on in those markets and why we

         12    missed it and talked a bit about what we

         13    might do to improve models.  And so there was

         14    a good general discussion that came out every

         15    year for people to take a look at.

         16              That was discontinued in the early

         17    '90s due to a variety of reasons, the biggest

         18    of which was budget.  Again, STEO was a

         19    quarterly model.  Accuracy, it was typically

         20    absolute average errors and percent errors.

         21    We didn't go any deeper to look at any

         22    regression-based tests to determine what's

          1    going on and what's missing and what you

          2    might get from additional information.  It

          3    was a fairly simple way of looking at what

          4    did you predict, what was it actually, how

          5    much were you off.

          6              Now, currently several of the

          7    programs, NEMS does publish forecast errors

          8    with their annual report but we in STEO don't

          9    publish our forecast errors.  Each analyst

         10    certainly keeps track of forecast errors for

         11    their components and we keep track internally

         12    of forecast errors for some key variables.

         13              We don't have an externally

         14    published document nor do we typically share

         15    our forecast errors or our discussions about

         16    forecast errors.  We haven't done that some

         17    time and that's one of the open questions

         18    that we'd like some guidance on, on what

         19    might be an ideal program to get back into

         20    this game and what should we be doing.

          1    are just the percent differences between a

          2    quarterly forecast, a quarterly average,

          3    because the STEO is, of course, now monthly

          4    and what the actual was.  And I'm putting

          5    these up here not so you could say they were

          6    really off.  I'm just putting these up here

          7    to show you what we keep track of and we have

          8    a series of about 12 or 14 of these graphs

          9    that we keep track of and take a look at to

         10    just tell ourselves are there any obvious

         11    things that we're overlooking, are there any

         12    trends going on here, but we don't do more

         13    analysis on this.  Again, we don't look at

         14    correlation among the errors.  We eyeball

         15    this, we say where have we been under-

         16    looking or overlooking, no surprise that in

         17    areas like international oil prices were less

         18    good than were on some of the demand

         19    equations or on some of the demand forecasts

         20    which tend to be more stable over time.

          1    from '95 to 2004.  You look at it and worry

          2    whether there are any more systematic things

          3    or gee, what happened back there in 2001 when

          4    we were really off.  The scales are different

          5    for each graph.  The percent is different for

          6    each one.  They're not comparable by eyeball.

          7    Some are moving in a much tighter band, some

          8    are in a much smaller band.  Here is for

          9    petroleum band where the band is really much

         10    tighter.  This is 3 percent error on either

         11    side.  So this is just an example of what we

         12    have internally but you don't see this.

         13              Should a forecasting program show

         14    this to you every month?  Should we show it

          2    every field and every country would we be

          3    able to have a better forecast if we had that

          4    data.  What's the value of getting that

          5    additional information and is it worth EIA to

          6    go out and get that information, purchase

          7    that information from commercial sources,

          8    because it will improve our forecast?

          9    Certainly at first blush it sounds as if we

         10    need more data, we need better data.  Without

         11    really doing an assessment of what that

         12    better data might buy you it's difficult to

         13    make that tradeoff.

          4              How do you use the results?  Again,

          5    the results aren't necessarily just for a

          6    report card to the public to say we're better

          7    than somebody else.  The results are to help

          8    us do diagnostics and improve the model.  My

          9    first goal is really for ourselves to do

         10    better and to have fairly simplified

         11    electronic ways to improve what we're doing

         12    particularly as we move from a national to a

         13    regional model.

         14              It's not to flagellate ourselves

         15    and the public.  It's a diagnostic tool.

         16    Certainly my gut feeling is that our forecast

         17    can stand up to anybody's forecast and that

         18    we're typically in very good shape on a lot

         19    of variables and I think that we've

         20    demonstrated that over the past.  It's not a

         21    competition.  It's about improving what we

         22    do.  So that's how to use the results.

          1              Should we compare ourselves with

          2    commercial forecasters?  We like to do that a

          3    lot, that we were more accurate than X, Y, or

          4    Z.  Should we do that in a more formal basis?

          5    Should that just be an internal thing?  Why

          6    would we want to do that?  How will we use

          7    their information to improve our forecasts?

          8              And how do we communicate with

          9    customers?  Again, it goes back to the issue

         10    I mentioned earlier.  Is this something we

         11    publish every year, is it something we put on

         12    the web, do we have a discussion with our

         13    customers, how do we communicate what this

         14    program might look like to those that might

         15    be interested in assessing what we're doing?

         16              I'm a manager in EIA.  I always got

         17    to worry about the bottom line and who do we

         18    have to do this and how we're going to get

         19    this done under, as Guy said, declining real

         20    budgets?  My manager in me tells me that

         21    these are the kinds of things that we need to

         22    build into our programs when we build them

          3    that that always is an add-on to what we're

          4    currently doing.  But I think that there's

          5    tremendous value in having some kind of a

          6    program even if it's rudimentary that is a

         10    that information every so often, monthly,

         11    quarterly, annually, to really steer us in a

         13    direction on what we're doing on our models.

         16    about forecasting and the last one is the one

         17    that I think is most valuable for us.  It is

         18    far better to foresee even without certainty

         19    than not to foresee at all.  It's really

         20    critical that EIA has a solid forecasting

         21    program.  We know we're going to be off

          9    and identify.  It's not easy to come up with

         10    a very clear answer.  Web statistics are

          1    very easily filter down, let's say, from your

          2    3,000 variables or 3500 different kinds of

          3    tests to maybe a basketful.  That seems to be

          4    at least the first step.  I mean, what are

          5    the key variables that have multiple error

          6    effects in your forecasts?  What are the key

          7    variables that people typically ask you?  It

          8    seems that that filtering should be done

          9    first before we even start addressing some of

         10    these questions.  Is that something you've

         11    already done internally?

         12              MS. ANDERSON:  Well, to the extent

         13    of the way we keep track of the variables.

         14    Now, we have made an initial triage from the

         15    national model and it's about 14 or 15 key

         16    variables, gasoline price, petroleum prices,

         17    demands, coal demand, coal price, natural

         18    gas, so we have done that for the program

         19    that we're using now which is looking at this

         20    absolute percent of changes.  But you're

         21    right and when you go to a regional model you

         22    may come up with 25 or 50 things that you

          3    regional specific?

          4              MS. ANDERSON:  Right, and you

          5    could, I think, set up some automated system

          6    that would peel off those variables and put

          7    them in a file as is done now and run the

          8    tests that you need to.  But yes, triage on a

          9    regional model is a bit more complicated but

         10    probably not that much more complicated.

         11              DR. HENGARTNER:  I will ask just

         12    one question, don't expect an answer, but

         13    just bring it out to the committee so that we

         14    can think about it.  One of the issues that I

         15    see with this modeling you're doing this we

         16    have 16,000 variables.  There's this risk of

         17    over-fitting and when you talk about looking

         18    at model or prediction errors I'm always

         19    asking myself well, which part is prediction

         20    error and which one is model error and which

         21    one comes from the over-fitting.  And so it

         22    seems that that's a concern for a

          4    that we should keep in the back of our mind

          5    as we continue discussing this topic because

          1    meaningless.  Earlier in the morning I heard

          2    some questions about what's the purpose of

          3    the model.  Can we use the model to do some

          4    useful risk analysis?  And I think one major

          5    objective of this regional model is to

          6    provide a link to the new integrated regional

          7    energy system in answering region-specific

          8    questions such as the summer electricity

          9    market, natural gas market, and the winter

         10    heating fuel market.

         11              Mark raised the question in

         12    California what kind of questions or answers

         13    or warnings can this kind of model provide.

         14    For example, when we look at summer

         15    electricity market because we have some

         16    regions we can actually analyze some of the

         17    impact in a region and see what happens to

         18    the fuel market and even generation

         19    potentials.  A few weeks ago I heard the

         20    governor actually declared Washington State a

         21    drought state.  And what happened is in the

         22    western region if Washington doesn't have

          1    enough hydropower California in the summer

          2    may have some different issues in terms of

          3    dispatching and importing of electricity.

          4    And we can actually use the model to simulate

          5    if there's less hydropower from Washington

          6    State what happens to the dispatching

          7    generation in California and what happens to

          8    the fuel use.

          9              For example, California has many,

         10    many natural gas power plants and so how much

         11    more natural gas power plants will be run and

         12    how much additional natural gas will be

         13    consumed?  And that can have an impact on the

         14    regional natural gas market as well as

         15    national natural gas consumption and

         16    eventually natural gas prices.  So that's the

         17    kind of thing we would like to see the model

         18    actually provide some linkage so we can track

         19    what happens.

         20              And in terms of the winter heating

         21    fuel market I think in the northeast the

         22    model also can provide some information on

          1    when we have above normal heating degree-days

          2    or cooling degree-days what happens to the

          3    natural gas consumption month by month and

          4    what happens to natural gas storage.  We can

          5    do some accounting there and as a result what

          6    happens to natural gas prices, and so you can

          7    actually provide some insight.  Of course,

          8    the heating fuel market also relates to the

          9    gasoline market and diesel fuel production

         10    and some other issues but natural gas plays a

         11    role there.  So that's the purpose of the

         12    model, what can a model do and how people

         13    want to use it really depends on the modeler

         14    as well as to potential users or

         15    stakeholders.

         16              The next few slides I will talk

         17    about model structure.  I think earlier

         18    people talked about this model is very

         19    complicated and there are so many exogenous

         20    variables but in reality the concept of the

         21    model is quite straightforward.  It's

         22    important to understand the concept.  The

          1    implementation is a different issue.

          2    Especially I'm not the one doing it but Dave

          3    is more concerned about a lot of the detail

          4    because he has to do it every month.

          5              The regional electricity model has

          6    13 regions and we group them into three trade

          7    zones like eastern interconnection, western

          8    interconnection, and Texas.  Each region has

          9    its own demand and supply representations.

         10    We have a 14th region, Hawaii and Alaska.  We

         11    don't really model it.  We treat it

         12    exogenously because it doesn't play a role in

         13    the lower 48 states but for accounting

         14    purposes we need to know how much electricity

         15    generated, what kind of fuel those regions

         16    consume.

         17              So this is a map to show you the 13

         18    regions.  The western region is the one I

         19    will spend more time.  Basically western

         20    region is mountain region.  We have Pacific

         21    region, Washington, Oregon State, and then

         22    California so we will break up the Pacific

          1    region into two parts and I will use the

          2    western interconnection as one example to

          3    illustrate some of the modeling issues and

          4    data issues and some of the preliminary

          5    result I just got yesterday.  But we have

          6    basically 13 regions from the map and then

          7    three separate prisms and the eastern

          8    interconnection has nine regions.  We have

          9    Texas as separate.

         10              For each region the way we solve it

         11    I'm talking about the concept.  I'm not

         12    talking about the number of variables we need

         13    to solve it, not yet.  For each region an

         14    average daily 24-hour load curve is derived

         15    from monthly demand.  And so we have monthly

         16    demand and then we convert it to load based

         17    on historical load data and temperature data

         18    and that's on the demand side.

         19              And a supply curve for each region

         20    is created from the EIA survey form, the EIA

         21    860, and we have the capacity and heat rates

         22    and a number of other plant characteristics.

          1    So the model basically searches for a

          2    minimum-cost supply which meets hourly

          3    demand.  So we have 24-hour load, and for

          4    each hour we have the supply curve for each

          5    region and then the demand we trace to the

          6    supply curve and find the point where supply

          7    equals demand and that's the supply.  And

          8    then from there we can estimate the

          9    generation by fuel type and fuel consumption.

         10              So this is the general concept of

         11    the model.  It's pretty straightforward.  We

         12    have regions and within each regions we have

         13    demand and supply and I will talk about the

         14    creation or the data we use to create the

         15    demand and supply.

         16              But the first step when we do model

         17    calibration is really the concept again is

         18    for a single region we need to make sure for

         19    model calibration the historical regional or

         20    for the trade zone the total demand plus

         21    transmission and distribution losses minus

         22    net import must be equal to the historical

          1    generation because the objective of this

          2    model is really seeing given the demand and

          3    supply, assuming there is no trade, there are

          4    T&D losses, then demand must be equal to

          5    supply in general.  That's the basic concept.

          6    For a single region that's the situation so

          7    there is a lot of data problems we have to

          8    deal with but we have found ways to handle

          9    the data issues and so basically the general

         10    concept is for a single region demand must be

         11    equal to generation and for the trade zone

         12    such as the western interconnection simply

         13    the sum of the demand plus T&D losses minus

         14    imports must be equal to the regional

         15    generation.

         16              DR. HENGARTNER:  Why don't they see

         17    exports?  I mean, if you have imports why

         18    don't --

         19              MS. KHANNA:  Net imports.

         20              MR. TSENG:  The import can be from

         21    outside the region.

         22              DR. HENGARTNER:  Oh, so imported

          3    This part looks very simple but if we don't

          4    get it right the model will not replicate the

          5    historical generation pattern.  So this is

          6    one example I look at.  For a single region

          7    13 is the Texas region and we have the fuel

          8    mix.  For example, we have residual fuel, we

          9    have diesel fuel, we have natural gas, coal,

         10    nuclear, hydro, and combined heat and power.

         11    But here the focus is really the fossil fuel.

         12    The dispatching model is really modeling the

         13    dispatching of residual fuel, diesel fuel,

         14    natural gas, and coal power plants and for

         15    nuclear, hydro, and combined heat and power.

         16              For nuclear and hydro they are base

         17    loads so most likely they run all the time

         18    and they have the priority.  And for the

         19    combined heat and power the economics is such

         20    that they are very different from the

         21    electric utilities so we don't really model

         22    them.  For the purpose of model calibration

          1    are winter peaks.  I think New England states

          2    my recollection is they are probably double

          3    peaks.  They have early in the morning, like

          4    4:00-5:00 o'clock you have a peak and then

          5    you have afternoon peak.  And so the shape of

          6    the load is like two separate curves.  You go

          7    up, down, and then go up again in the

          8    afternoon for the New England regions in the

         14    in it?  I mean, there is a drop of over half

         15    in month 11?

         18    think it's based on regional demand patterns

         19    because in Texas really the purpose of

         20    generation is just to meet the demand.

         10    September is a great month in Texas.  It's

         11    not hot and it's not cold.

         12              MR. COSTELLO:  We have forecasts by

         14    monthly basis.  In other words we don't do

         16    Nuclear, and Electric Group does that for us

         18    those scheduled things.  This might not have

         19    been a scheduled one there.  We know on a

         21    as to when there might tend to be operating

          3    Texas.

          4              MR. TSENG:  Wind is pretty high in

          5    California.  Actually originally when we

          6    model the power generation dispatching we had

          7    everything and we had even solar.  But when

          8    you look at the numbers and in terms of the

          9    level of effort to capture renewable it gets

         10    to be very difficult.  And also for renewable

         11    such as wind and solar the dispatching is not

         12    economics.  Dispatching is basically weather-

         13    related and the purpose of dispatching

         14    algorithm is really trying to capture the

         15    economics of dispatching of fossil fuel.  And

         16    if it's not economics we lump them into a

         17    group and we then use time series analysis

         18    and treat it as exogenous in the dispatching

          1    dispatching varies.  In California the

          2    utilization of the wind capacity is about 10

          3    to 15 percent in December and January and it

          4    can go up to about more than 50 percent in

          5    May and June so it varies.  So time series

          6    approach is better than economics approach

          7    because the economic model doesn't predict

          8    the weather pattern and so the wind

          9    generation cannot be captured using economic

         10    model.

         11              MR. BERNSTEIN:  So if I get it

         13    generation forms are being brought

         14    exogenously some place else outside the

         15    dispatch?

         16              MR. TSENG:  Right, outside the

         17    dispatch model.  That's why we have so many

         18    exogenous variables listed because we do need

         19    a different approach for the dispatching

         20    model.  Now, for a region like the western

          1    estimated demand and then generation.  So you

          2    can see for each region the demand level is

          3    different from the generation level.  Like

          4    Region 10 is California.  The consumption

          5    level or the estimated demand is a lot higher

          6    than its own generation.  The generation

          7    number is historical.  So you can see

          8    California imports electricity from Regions 8

          9    and 9.

         10              So just to give you the flavor what

         11    the model is trying to do, it's basically

          4    looking at the maps and trying to just

          5    understand what you're saying.

          6              MR. TSENG:  So what we do, once we

          7    have the general dispatching algorithm is

          8    basically is cost based and then we actually

          9    started running the model and we have got

         10    some results.  For some cases it looks okay

         11    but some cases it doesn't so we need to add

         12    some model parameters to control the behavior

         13    of the model.  And actually some of the

         14    questions we like to ask to the committee is

         15    are we doing the write-up right away or we on

         16    the right track.

         17              So the steps in model calibration

         18    basically the first step I had mentioned is

         19    develop and verify that regional demand and

         20    generation data are comparable because that's

         21    the most important thing.  If the demand is

         22    too high or too low we can never replicate

          1    the dispatching pattern.

          2              In the second step we analyze

          3    historical generation data at a generator

          4    level to identify outliers.  Then we look at

          5    some historical data and see what happens in

          6    the real world and right now we have focused

          7    on year 2002 data and we have something like

          8    8,000 records of generators and power plants

          9    and we look at the generation, we look at

         10    fuel consumption, and we try to understand

         11    the generation pattern.

         12              And the third step is we estimate

         13    some of the key model parameters.  I will

         14    talk about that.  And then we go through the

         15    fourth step is basically check the model

         16    result, check for data consistency, and do

         17    another iteration to see if we get better

         18    results.  And so basically understand what

         19    the model is doing even though we created the

         20    algorithm but the behavior of the model is

         21    not all controlled by us.  It has its own

         22    personality.

          1              The historical demand and

          2    generation data, we have several sources.

          3    Regional demand is arrived from the EIA 826,

          4    which is monthly sales data, and the

          5    difficulty is the monthly sales are based on

          6    billing cycles and in most instances they are

          7    not calendar month data.  So if the billing

          8    cycle could be from the 26th of one month,

          9    ends in the 29th of the following month, and

         10    apparently even within the same states the

         11    billing cycles could be different for

         12    different customers.  So that creates some of

         13    the data issue in terms of how we can get a

         14    consistent demand data.  Regional generation

         15    is from the EIA 906, which is calendar month,

         16    so that's the kind of data issues we face and

         17    we have to deal with.

         18              So in terms of analysis we have to

         19    convert the demand from billing cycle to

         20    calendar month and adjust demand supply in

         21    imports and create identity.  So just the

         22    first steps in order to validate a model and

          1    then to examine the behavior of the model.

          2              The second thing we do is we

          3    analyze generation data.  It's very tedious

          4    but it's getting interesting to understand

          5    what the data is telling us.  So we used net

          6    generation and fuel use data to estimate heat

          7    rate.  So we have the fuel consumption, we

          8    have the generation, and we use the heat rate

          9    and the fuel prices to compute variable cost.

         10    That's what we can do using the data and we

         11    use data on generation capacity and the net

         12    generation to compute utilization rates.  And

         13    then we do some regression analysis to see if

         14    we can identify any patterns.

         15              So this chart basically gives you a

         16    flavor of how does it look and we basically

         17    did a double log and we'll run regression

         18    between the utilization rates in July and the

         19    variable cost in July and see well, what's

         20    the pattern.  And --

          1    guess is what you are seeing there within

          2    California is the fact of the matter is that

          3    Southern California Edison or Los Angeles

          4    Department of Water and Power has a different

          5    cost structure for their fuels and for their

          6    plants than does PG&E as well as San Diego

          7    Gas and Electric and you're trying to

          8    economically dispatch across California which

          9    you may not be able to do.

         10              MR. TSENG:  Right, that's --

         11              MR. BERNSTEIN:  ———————— other

         12    states.

         13              MR. TSENG:  Exactly, that's why I

         14    would describe to you the steps we use to

         15    actually structure the dispatching and now I

         16    have one example to show you the results.

         17              MR. SANDERS:  Is it part of a

         18    distribution because you got different types

         19    of power plants, from combined cycles to

         20    steam to turbines to I wouldn't say coal, not

         21    in California, but, I mean, I think that's a

         22    large part of it, the variation shown.

          1              MR. TSENG:  And also the reality is

          2    some of the similarly high cost power plants

          3    are running at high utilization rate could be

          4    in the low pocket so you could have

          5    infrastructure constraints like transmission

          6    lines capacity is limited just like the ————

          7    Dispatching is based on the location and

          8    margin and pricing.  So if it's in your

          9    pocket you have no choice but dispatch the

         10    high cost power plant.  And so in our

         12    kinds of things using statistical methods

         13    instead of the economic approach.

         14              DR. HENGARTNER:  Essentially, I

         16    the gird works you could identify which

         17    regions are constrained with the input and

         18    that's where you are going to have those

         19    higher cost power plants being used.

         20              MR. TSENG:  Exactly, and that's

          1    fossil fuel power plants in California?

          2              MR. TSENG:  All the fossil in

          3    California, yes.

          4              MR. CLEVELAND:  There are only 28

          5    of them.

          6              MR. TSENG:  I thought there were

          7    like, 70 or 80 of them.

          8              DR. HENGARTNER:  Not on this plot.

          9              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Unless they get

         10    plotted one on top of other.

         11              MR. TSENG:  So this just to give

         12    you a flavor of the pattern and the next

         13    thing is once we understand the data we look

         14    at the data and we look at a pattern and we

         15    say well, there are some high cost high

         16    utilization rate power plants.  And if we put

         17    these power plants in the dispatching

         18    solution algorithm based on the cost those

         19    power plants would not be dispatched.

         20              So it doesn't mimic the historical

         21    generation pattern and we need to capture

         22    that in order to replicate the history.  So

          1    for regions such as California for input

          2    regions it's pretty easy to target the total

          3    generation.  So all we have to do is run the

          4    model and identify import constraint and we

          5    say well, this is the inflow limits

          6    California can take.  It could be seasonal so

          7    we allow some like 5percent up and down

          8    variation but in general that's the limit.

          9    When we run a model we see the total

         10    generation in California matches the

         11    historical generation.  That's the way we

         12    identify the import constraints.

         13              And then the next step is based on

         14    the scattergram and regression analysis.  We

         15    assign generators.  Actually we have five

         16    load groups but for fossil plants we assign

         17    each to one of the four groups.  We assign it

         18    as a plant type code, equal to one if the

         19    utilization rate is greater than 75 percent.

         20    So we are basically structured based on 75

         21    percent, 50 to 75, 25 to 50, and 25 and

         22    below.  So 75 and above we will be putting

          1    the plant type code 1.  So they will be

          2    dispatched earlier.  So that's the way we

          3    structure the power plants.

          4              So the model solution is still the

          5    same solution algorithm except dispatching

          6    order we have two levels of sorting criteria.

          7    One is if the plant has a dispatching order 1

          8    they would be dispatched first and within the

          9    group of 1 everything is based on economics.

         10              MS. KHANNA:  Question?

         11              MR. TSENG:  Yes.

         12              MS. KHANNA:  Does the variable cost

         13    vary across dispatching?  Could it have a

         14    plot in group 4 that actually has a lower

         15    marginal cost than one in group 1 but your

         16    model is forcing you ————————————————

         17              MR. TSENG:  Yeah, it could.

         18    Actually we found some observations with very

         19    low cost but with very small utilization

         20    rate.  And we have no way to understand why

         21    that's the case so we put those power plants

         22    in group 4 anyway because the utilization

          1    rate is very low.

          2              So this is the statistical

          3    approach.  We look at the statistics and we

          4    say well, if this is the historical pattern

          5    we want to be able to capture the historical

          6    pattern.  And if we have more time maybe we

          7    can visit the plants and ask them exactly why

          8    they are doing the way they are doing, why

          9    they don't generate more power.  Is it

         10    because of the transmission or is it because

         11    something other than economics?  So this

         12    becomes actually a very important element in

         13    replicating the historical generation pattern

         14    and fuel share.

         15              Another area we have to do is the

         16    numerical criteria for fuel switching.  In

         17    2002 the price of natural gas and oil was

         18    pretty stable so we didn't have to worry

         19    about fuel switching.  That's why for model

         20    validation purposes the first step is we just

         21    look at year 2002 data and then we say well,

         22    can we replicate the historical pattern.

          1              And 2003 is another world because

          2    natural gas price went up a lot and I know

          3    for a fact New York actually switched a lot

          4    of the dual fuel power plants from natural

          5    gas to oil so the oil consumption in New York

          6    State went up.  And so once we finish this

          7    step we would then run the model to the next

          8    12 months.

          9              Another parameter is we need to

         10    understand what other factors like gas power

         11    plants switched to oil then storage becomes

         12    an issue.  Supply of diesel fuel becomes an

         13    issue.  Environmental issues all can affect

         14    the switching and we need to understand a

         15    little bit more and then establish some kind

         16    of criteria for fuel switching.

         17              Another thing is coal power plants

         18    burn a little bit oil and little bit natural

         19    gas.  It could be one-tenth, probably two-

         20    tenths or five-tenths of a percent but since

         21    co-generation number is so big, five-tenths

         22    of a percent, it makes up a big number and

          1    that can actually create a bias in terms of

          2    how much natural gas is consumed in power

          3    generation so we need to look at that as

          4    well.  Those are all included in the EIA 906

          5    data survey and we have the information to do

          6    the analysis.

          7              And the last one is hydropower.

          8    Actually it's not always used to meet base

          9    load.  It's not running all the time as base

         10    load and we have some evidence to indicate

         11    that some of the hydropower especially like

         12    in New York are used to meet peak load

         13    demand.  And so we sometimes for model

         14    calibration purposes adjust the hydropower

         15    dispatching and so hydropower can be used to

         16    meet peak load demand as well.  So those are

         17    the parameters we have to calibrate.

         18              And the last step is we check for

         19    data inconsistency.  When we run a model we

         20    would look at results and then compare with

         21    the historical data and make some adjustment

         22    to the power plant's dispatching order.  Like

          1    the plant code in some regions sometimes we

          2    call it category 2 dispatching plants but

          3    after we run the simulation we see actually

          4    that some of the power plants should be in

          5    category 1 because the of cost structure.

          6              Just look at the size of the

          7    region.  The Mountain Region covers so many

          8    different states so the fuel prices can be

          9    very different and some of the dispatching

         10    pattern may have something to do with the

         11    fuel prices as well but we have only one

         12    representative regional price for each

         13    region.  So when we calculate the variable

         14    cost there could be some misleading effects

         15    as well.  So that's the process we have to go

         16    through.  Yes?

         17              MS. KHANNA:  So that tells me that

         18    what category a plant belongs to is really

         19    endogenous or should be endogenous rather

         20    than being coded exogenously or there should

         21    be some part —————————— at least.

         22              MR. TSENG:  Well, most of the power

          1    plants right now the way that we run the

          2    model is determined.  Like, we have five

          3    categories.  Nuclear and hydro we assign a

          4    dispatching order of 0, which means it will

          5    be dispatched first.  For fossil plants we

          6    assign a dispatching order of 1 through 4.

          7    It's based on historical pattern.  So if

          8    historical data indicates a power plant is

          9    running 80 percent most of the time through

         10    the 12-month period we have historical data

         11    then we put those power plants in category 1.

         12              MS. KHANNA:  That made a lot of

         13    sense right up to your last statement where

         14    you said that sometimes because let's say if

         15    natural gas prices go crazy suddenly you'll

         16    find a plant is going to be operated more or

         17    less than it has historically been.  So can't

         18    your model capture maybe some limited amount

         19    of jumping around in reaction to changes of

         20    cost ———— different from the historical

         21    pattern?

          1    model behavior issue because sometimes

          2    certain power plants if we have a high cost

          3    power plant even though say, for example, the

          4    utilization rate is 49 or 51 and if you are

          5    putting a different category it may be bumped

          6    down all the way to the bottom of the

          7    category and the utilization rate of the

          8    power plant can never reflect a historical

          9    pattern which we don't know.  And so we do

         10    have to make some adjustment based on the

         11    simulation results and then based on the

         12    observed data.

         13              DR. HENGARTNER:  I think what I

         15    that can either use gas or oil in your

         16    analysis they are treated as two separate

         17    power plants?

          6    turbine that switches, depending on the price

          7    of gas, switches from either being a peaking

          8    unit to being a base load or --

          9              MS. KHANNA:  Right, whereas their

         10    model has a cost in one mode and it can't

         11    jump from there.

         12              DR. EDMONDS:  Yes, and actually one

         13    other thing that might help us understand is

         14    you've got a 0 bin which always gets

         15    dispatched, a bin 1, a bin 2, a bin 3, and a

         16    bin 4, and those bins are historical

         17    utilization rates?

         18              MR. TSENG:  Yes.

         19              DR. EDMONDS:  Now, when you run the

         20    model how do you determine the utilization

         21    rate of bins 1 through 4?  In other words you

         22    have got these historical utilization rates

          6              MR. TSENG:  Oh, it will because the

          7    reasons power plants are in bin 4 because

          8    there is demand for those power plants.  In

          9    the summer, for example, the shape of the

         10    load curve is very different.  The peak

         11    demand level in California, I think, could be

         12    as high as like 45,000 megawatts but in --

         15    wintertime, you will never run those plants?

         16              MR. TSENG:  Right, that's why we

         17    see utilization rate for some power plants is

         18    like 10 percent or 5 percent.  Part of the

         19    reason is they are not used unless the demand

         20    is really high.

          8    forgetting about that.

          9              MR. TSENG:  Actually the way we

         10    structured four bins is if there is an

         11    infrastructure bottleneck the statistics will

         12    reflect you have a high cost and high

         13    utilization rate power plants and we put them

         14    in bin 1 so they will be used.  So we are

         16    here.

          4    trading region by cost that we were going to

          5    get some plants that wouldn't get used that

          7    without going to the plant and finding out

          8    exactly why that was we just assume that they

          9    really needed to be in a prior order for some

         10    other reason like one of those that Phil

         16    Western region I have a few examples.  I will

         17    go into that.  So that's the way we do it.

         18    It's an iterative process and we have to

         19    understand the data and we have to understand

         20    the behavior of the model and then we have to

          2              MR. BERNSTEIN:  I hate to ask this

          3    but, given that you have historical data, why

          4    bother doing a dispatch model at all?  Why

          5    not use historical trends because you are

          6    talking about short-term forecast?  It seems

          7    like a whole lot of work when you're going to

          8    have to check it against the historical data

          9    anyway.  Why don't we use whatever is there?

         10              MR. TSENG:  Actually at the

         11    beginning I did a lot of regression analysis

         12    and I thought maybe a simple fuel share

         13    approach would do.  But happened is the fuel

         14    share changes.  It can go down to 4-5 percent

         15    for natural gas and go up to like 20 percent

         16    and depend on the demand.  And now the

         17    question would be how do we know the shape of

         18    the load curve and how that shape of the load

         19    curve relates to the generation by fuel type.

         20    And so if you look at statistical methods and

         21    if you could come up with something I think

         22    that will save us a lot of trouble.

          3    What you are really interested in is marginal

          4    price.  You're interested in marginal

          5    capacity constraints and I just --

          8    the power sector.

          9              MR. BERNSTEIN:  Right, but you

         10    could do that using historical information on

         11    historical generation.  There are enough

         12    years of data to be able to do that without

         13    having to create your own dispatch model

         14    because what I worry about in do your own

         15    dispatch model is how many utilities are

         17    versus some other strange thing that some

         18    utilities are doing.

          6              DR. FEDER:  Jae, I think you were

          7    making assumptions that you will really

          8    understand it if you have the model.  Think

          9    of how many years it took for the weather

         10    forecast to get it right and they have daily

         11    correction to the models because you can see

         12    what the weather is, how well you are

         13    predicting it, so I think 12,000 and even

         14    1,000 is a lot.

         15              MR. CLEVELAND:  But a lot of the

         17    fundamental economic theory and so you feel a

         10    have to understand the physical thing that is

         11    going on and in Texas the electric bidding

         12    process of how you get paid for your electric

         13    power now is on an hourly market basis and

         14    nuke plants and coal plants are willing to

         15    pay to put their power into the grid at 3:00

         16    o'clock in the morning on a nice day and so

         17    there is some obvious logic of why coal

         18    plants and nuclear plants are not going to be

         19    very sensitive to natural gas prices or oil

         20    prices or anything else at a period of time.

          6    market whichever it turns out to be.

          7              MR. TSENG:  Yes.  I mean, basically

          8    the dispatching is demand driven and the load

          9    shape changes by the hour and so if demand is

         10    low some of the power plants will not be

         11    used.  And in terms of pricing by the hour we

         12    actually have prices by the hour based on the

         13    margin of cost.  And how do we use it in

         14    terms of the example you used in terms of

         15    nuclear power plants?  Two a.m. it wants to

         16    generate because it cannot shut down and we

         17    actually observed sometimes you can see

         18    negative price because they simply are saying

         19    well, we will pay you to use our power.  We

         20    cannot shut down our nuclear power plants.

         21    And we have a long way to go to capture that

         22    kind of sophistication.

          1              I'm going to move on to the data

          2    sources so I will quickly list the kind of

          3    information we have and actually almost all

          4    the information we use to build a model and

          5    make model dispatching decisions based on EIA

          6    and the FERC information.  The EIA 906,

          7    monthly data on generation, I mentioned that

          8    the EIA 826 monthly electricity utility

          9    sales, and EIA 423 and the FERC 423 with

         10    monthly costs and quality of fuel for

         11    electricity plants and EIA 860, capacity

         12    information, and for imports from Canada and

         13    Mexico we have from Fossil Fuel Office the

         14    information there.

         15              Now, before I show you any result I

         16    want to just say a few words about data.  I

         17    think data is one major issue for almost all

         18    modelers.  The sales and generation data are

         19    subject to reporting errors and estimation

         20    errors because sometimes we have non-

         21    respondents and then an EIA data analyst will

         22    have to come up with some methods to fill the

          1    gaps and so when we run a model sometimes we

          2    see some pattern which is not exactly

          3    consistent with what we observed from the

          4    data.

          5              And also regional aggregation may

          6    introduce biases to the cost-based

          7    dispatching.  Even I heard northern

          8    California and southern California may have

          9    different natural gas prices but in a model

         10    since we have only one region we have one

         11    regional price for California.  And that may

         12    also create some dispatching difficulties

         13    when we use cost alone.

         14              And the oil and gas consumed in

         15    coal power plants are hard to predict so we

         16    apply a simple factor based on historical

         17    share.  And the timing of hydropower

         18    dispatching we would basically play with it

         19    and then see makes the model behave the way

         20    we think it's reasonable and we have

         21    variables we can publish so people can

         22    provide comments on the validity of those

          1    assumptions.

          2              And lastly I think when Nick

          3    mentioned about nuclear power plants, why

          4    it's half of the normal, this model we don't

          5    do ex ante because we don't know what may

          6    happen.  Like if we have forced outage there

          7    is no way we can capture that.  For the ex

          8    post we can always make adjustment to the

          9    plant availability and we can adjust it.  And

         10    so the model result can replicate a history

         11    but in most cases we just try to understand

         12    what it is instead of trying to change the

         13    model structure to replicate one or two or

         14    three months.

         15              So the difficulty in terms of

         16    modeling the dispatching behavior is we are

         17    looking at month by month instead of most

         18    models look at a baseline year and then say

         19    well, we calibrate to one year.  It's much

         20    easier.  But when we have to go through maybe

         21    12 or 24 data points and then make

         22    projections that's a challenge.

          8    the variable cost greater than 20 cents per

          9    kilowatt hour.  So from the scattergram I

         10    couldn't see any pattern.  So when we run

         15              MR. TSENG:  This is another thing.

         16    When we looked at the 906 data we found some

         17    plants reported utilization, the net

         18    generation number, and we know the capacity

         19    and we calculate the utilization rate based

         20    on the generation and capacity and we come up

          1    differences.  What happened is the EIA 906

          2    and 860 are two different survey forms.  And

          3    so 906 collects the generation and 860

          4    collects the capacity.  And so there's a data

          5    processing issue in matching the record.  And

          6    so when we look at the data the first

          7    reaction was you have bad data point.  But

          8    when we looked at detail this is how tedious

          9    it is and we found out one plant, for

         10    example, you have this high point here like

         11    there is a top point here.  Basically it's

         12    like almost 300 percent.  And we look at 860

         13    data and we found out that the capacity

         14    number in the 906 missed two big power

         15    plants.  And so if we include those two big

         16    power plants then the capacity utilization

         17    rate becomes like 92 percent instead of

         18    almost 300 percent.  So those are the data

         19    issues we found and we have to face.

         20              So what I am saying is when we do

         21    analysis a lot of times people want to use

         22    automated approach and we found looking at

          1    the data can be tedious but it's also very

          2    productive.

          3              This is another scattergram, just

          4    give you a flavor.  If we eliminate some of

          5    the outliers and this is the pattern and,

          6    again, regression analysis will not help us a

          7    whole lot.

          8              MR. BERNSTEIN:  Well, but if you go

          9    backward, I mean, what that tells me is that

         10    maybe they're not doing economic dispatch

         11    because you are seeing plants, you are seeing

         12    a rectangle, and to me that says maybe either

         13    at the region level it's not being

         14    economically dispatched which we know because

         15    it's done at the utility level but even at

         16    the utility level maybe they're not really

         17    economically dispatching any more.

         18              That's what I would question when I

         19    look at that data, not necessarily whether

         20    the approach is right but I would say to

         21    myself well, I would expect to see if they

         22    were economically dispatching some

          4              MR. BERNSTEIN:  And so 2002 in the

          5    western region it wasn't particularly hot or

          6    anything but maybe they're just having to use

          7    everything because of peak demands but I just

          8    don't see a pattern and so I would say to

          9    myself is there any relationship between

         10    utilization rate and cost.  And I would ask

         11    that first before I develop a dispatch model.

         12              DR. HENGARTNER:  So to confirmed

         13    your hypothesis, we would look at the month

         14    of August, say, decide if there was more or

         15    less utilization, and see if there is more

         18    Is that what you are suggesting?

         19              MR. BERNSTEIN:  I think that's one

         20    of the things, I mean, but I would certainly

         21    try to figure out from the data if there is

         22    anything that helps us determine what is the

          1    relationship between cost and use.

          2              MR. WOOD:  You get to pass through

          3    most of the marginal generation cost for fuel

          4    and so if it doesn't take customers off-line

          5    and there is a little delay before you get to

          6    reclaim the rate but you do get to pass it

          7    through theoretically so what you are saying

          8    there may be some very good reasons that

          9    since you get to pass through the cost that

         10    you have another reason for a dispatch.

         11              MR. TSENG:  Well, actually looking

         12    at the data, the interesting part is when we

         13    mix a large trade zone like the Mountain

         14    Region with the Pacific region the fuel

         15    prices are very different.  Natural gas in

         16    Oregon, Washington is almost a buck less than

         17    California and Mountain Region and coal

         18    prices in the Mountain Region is probably a

         19    buck less than the other two regions.

         20              And so when we plot it it actually

         21    can be very misleading.  That's the thing is

         22    if you look at a pattern you would say well,

          1    there is no pattern.  The reality is there

          3    approach, we can probably capture some of

          4    those relationships.

          5              MR. BERNSTEIN:  Right, but have to

          6    do I think a bunch more analysis before

          7    getting to the point of creating this

          8    dispatch model and that's what I --

          9              MR. TSENG:  Okay, here I will show

         10    you some of the results.  Again, I am using

         11    the year 2002 monthly data and have model

         12    results.  I think I can show what it is.

         13    Basically what I did was we have 4 bins where

         14    we put the fossil fuel plants.  And for

         15    California we have the import limits and

         16    that's about it in terms of the dispatching

         17    order.  I made some adjustment, move power

         18    plants from bin 3 to bin 2 or bin 2 to bin 1,

         19    some minor adjustment, and actually it looks

         20    pretty good if you look at out of top month,

         21    eighth month, in terms of total regional

         22    generation they are within reasonable level.

          1              And part of the reason April, May,

          2    June and July the numbers looked screwy was

          3    for whatever reason Oregon and Washington

          4    State had significant drop in gas and coal

          5    generation.  So those four months suddenly

          6    the generation in the region dropped almost

          7    like, by 50 percent.

          8              I have no understanding of what

          9    happened there but I think if I have time I

         10    can talk to people why the numbers are such.

         11    Other than that if you believe historical

         12    generation pattern can replicate a history

         13    that's the kind of numbers we actually

         14    generated from the model result.

         15              And another criterion I can look at

         16    is the differences between simulated value

         17    and the 2002 annual total.  If I sum the gas

         18    and coal so basically the model likes coal a

         19    little bit more; however, if I make an

         20    adjustment making assumptions, say like 0.5

         21    percent of natural gas is consumed in coal

         22    power plants then I can add like 1,600 to gas

          5    months of peculiar data pattern and using

          6    historical pattern you will not capture that

          7    because I don't know why in one month, for

          8    example, in July or June the coal generation

          9    in Washington or Oregon, that region, dropped

         10    from average 1200 to less than 200.

         11              MR. BERNSTEIN:  I will tell you

         12    why, because one aluminum plant decided they

         13    were making more money.  I mean, this is the

         14    profit.  Kaiser could make more money

         16    long-term contract with ———————— power than

         17    to actually consume it and so they shut down.

          9    are the regression techniques we used

         10    acceptable for changing a dispatching order.

         11    I mean, if there is a better way to capture

         12    the dispatching and understand the behavior

         13    of the power generators we would definitely

         15    question, as Margot earlier mentioned about

         16    evaluation, given the data quality what is an

          1    what you really want to use this for and one

          2    way of dealing with this is to create

          3    marginal cost curves for electricity in

          4    regions based on historical data as opposed

          5    to dispatching it so you get a production

          6    cost curve or a marginal cost curve that

          7    gives you both by fuels and by total

          8    generation and use that and you adjust that

          9    as new historical data comes in.  That's one

         10    way to do it.

         11              You're not looking to produce a

         12    forecast of dispatch.  You're using it to

         13    produce a forecast of electricity demand at

         14    the regional level, supply constraints at the

         15    regional level, and prices at the regional

         16    level.

         17              MR. TSENG:  Well, actually we did

         18    look at creating a marginal cost curve;

         19    however, it's a monthly effort so the

         20    dispatching hours basically is creating

         21    supply curve month by month using the monthly

         22    fuel cost information we get from the FERC

          4    marginal cost curve based on those power

          5    plants then the concept is almost identical

          6    to the dispatching algorithm that we are

          7    using.

          8              MR. BEINSTEIN:  But I would do it

          9    more on historical.  See, what you're doing

         10    is you're mixing historical information with

         11    doing an optimization routine for dispatching

         12    the plants and I'm not sure you need that

         13    last step.

         14              DR. HENGARTNER:  Thank you very

         15    much Phillip.  I'm sorry that we ran out of

         16    time, but it's surely not the last time we'll

          2    to report on what their discussion was about.

         10    skip you but it didn't work.

         11              MS. FORSYTH:  So we talked about

         12    frame comparisons downstairs and it's an

         13    update from work that we talked about last

         14    fall so the Census is been working with EIA

         15    to help EIA assess the kinds of frame errors

         16    if any they have in five of their data

         17    collection efforts.

         18              And the census has completed work

         19    evaluating three of those frames and

         20    presented some preliminary results and a

         21    question.  The preliminary results are that

         22    in general the EIA frames look very good.

          1    All three of the frames that they've examined

          2    so far are small frames so that when you're

          3    missing a unit or two it looks like you're

          4    missing a lot and in fact you are missing a

          5    lot.  You're missing a large portion of the

          6    frame.

          7              And so in one of the evaluations

          8    there were several units missing producing

          9    like, 70 percent match rate when you're

         10    looking at the frame units but in terms of

         11    the volume of products, which was one of the

         12    key indicators, the volume of product

         13    captured is still relatively high so those

         14    relatively few nonmatching frame units are

         15    also producing relatively low amounts of

         16    product and therefore including them in the

         17    frame doesn't alter the expected estimates

         18    much.  So it looks like there are some units

         19    missing but there have relatively low impact

         20    and therefore the frames are pretty good for

         21    EIA's purposes.

          1    small frames.  There are two more waiting

          2    that will be with larger frames and there's a

          3    larger potential for error there.  So we are

          4    interested to see what those results will be.

          5    The question put to the committee was whether

          6    this frame evaluation should be an ongoing

          7    effort, just part of the economic census,

          8    and, of course, the committee didn't answer

          9    the question but at least part of the reason

         10    is that we can't really because we can see

         11    the benefits of doing the evaluation but we

         12    don't really know the cost and so we can't

         13    really help do the real decision-making that

         14    needs to be made.

         15              As part of the ongoing EIA

         16    evaluation looks like the frames are pretty

         17    good to start with and so the likelihood of a

         18    big dramatic change at least in the frames

         19    that we looked at so far is probably small,

         20    and so the five-year evaluation may not be a

         21    really important thing for at least those

         22    three small frames we've looked at.

          1              And one thing that did come up in

          2    the course of the conversation is that

          3    currently the way the census is done, the

          4    matching, it's like a two-stage matching

          5    process.  First the EIA establishments are

          6    matched to the business registered at the

          7    Census Bureau and then once that matching is

          8    done you can get a general assessment of how

          9    much change there is likely to be and then

         10    from there you can go on to look in more

         11    detail at the comparison between the EIA

         12    frame and the economic census results.

         13              And if you retain that two-stage

         14    process then you could look at a more regular

         15    evaluation of the EIA frames and do that

         16    first stage to assess whether the more

         17    detailed second stage is necessary and that

         18    might be a way, if it is costly, of assessing

         19    whether the second more costly stage is

         20    necessary.  I mean, if the first stage

         21    indicates there isn't much reason to believe

         22    there is error then you may not need to go

         11    going to have to summarize.  I had generated

         17    of the fundamental issues was raised which I

         18    think seems they have already been answered

         19    by EIA is whether a dispatch model is the way

         20    in which you want to try and approach

         21    regional electricity forecasting.  My opinion

         22    is that it probably is and certainly will

          5    of course, with these structural models the

          6    parameters and how much you have to monkey

          7    with them to get the model to balance is, of

          8    course, where the rubber meets the road, and

          9    I think with what I had to read it's a

         10    difficult model to assess given the

         11    documentation but I see a number of, I think,

         12    areas where more information could be

         14    happening.

         15              There are two interrelated issues

         16    of data aggregation and then the estimation

         18    table showing all the different types of key

         20    resolution is if it wasn't cleared.  There

         21    are lots of different data in here.  It's

          1    level of spatial aggregation is because you

          2    have generation data and cost data and then

          3    you have utility data so you have all these

          4    different layers of spatial resolution.  It's

          5    important to be able to judge the

          6    appropriateness of your techniques without

          7    having that information.

          8              It also wasn't clear when you asked

          9    the question, Phil, about your regression

         10    techniques.  I don't know what you did.  Are

         11    these panel data that you are estimating the

         12    cost functions?  Is that panel data?

         13              MR. TSENG:  It's just

         14    cross-sections, one year.

         16    cross-section, and when you do have panel

         17    data there, I mean, why not use panel data,

         20    the techniques you are using are appropriate

         21    is as important as knowing what the data are.

          1    random effects, estimated panel data?  There

          2    are lots of choices and, again, it depends on

          3    what questions you're really trying to ask.

          4    The issue of calibration is also important

          5    with these structural models.  It's always

          6    hard to know the —————————— issue is always a

          7    difficult one.

          8              Another possibility is to use some

          9    kind of statistical technique to take an out

         10    of sample forecast using one or two years

         11    worth of data to see how your model will

         12    actually predict some of these key parameters

         13    in a statistical sense which would give you

         14    some kind of statistical sense of how well

         15    the model is doing.

         16              I think another important area is

         17    this whole fuel switching issue and there's a

         18    fairly rich literature out there on how

         19    people respond to prices in fuel choices and

         20    some of the more recent work shows that what

         21    we thought used to be the case is in fact

         22    much more complicated.  There are these so

          2    Dermot Gately and some other people have

          3    looked at that.  So I think you want to look

          4    at this fuel switching behavior to make sure

          5    that the techniques and data used are

          6    consistent with what economists are telling

          7    us and what we've observed in the real world.

          8              But I think this idea of the

          9    optimizing behavior, the write-up that I read

         10    and the graphs I saw and your verbiage seemed

         11    very inconsistent.  They may not be but on

         12    one hand in the paper, the write-up, you're

         13    saying we use regression techniques to

         14    estimate this relationship between cost and

         15    utilization but we see the relationships are

         16    all over the map so how exactly did you

          5    I understand that but this is the kind of

          6    information that we would need to be able to

          7    give you some feedback into whether these

          8    techniques are appropriate.  When you look at

          9    the data, as Mark observed, the data say non-

         10    optimizing economic behavior but in fact

         11    there probably is a fair amount of economic

         12    optimization.  In some ISOs I think they're

         13    required by law.  I think in New England, if

         14    I'm correct, you're required by law to

         15    dispatch by cost except under certain extreme

         16    circumstances.  So that's the kind of

         17    information that we need to answer those

         18    questions.

         19              Well, I think it's a good start and

         20    I think that the structural approach I'm not

         10              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Thank you.  What

         11    I'm responsible for is putting together a

         12    short-term regional model for propane and

         13    heating oil residential prices.  I'm covering

         14    the propane and just heating oil residential

         15    prices models now and I'm covering them

         16    together because structurally they are

         17    identical models.  And the problems we have

         18    in one model we have the same problems in the

         19    other model.  And I want to go quickly over

         20    the structure of the models but more

         21    particularly point out where I'm having

          2    when Margot was up here, what are the data

          3    limitations, and I'll show you some problems

          4    I have in the data that I'm dealing with and

          5    what implications and what problems that

          6    creates on the modeling side.  This is not as

          7    ambitious a model as Phillip's electricity

          8    model because propane and heating oil make up

          9    each less than 10 percent, more like 5

         10    percent, of the heating markets.  We're

         11    taking a much narrower view to what we are

         12    modeling here.

         13              For example, residential propane

         14    makes up about 25 percent of total propane

         15    demand and around 6 or 7 percent of the

         16    heating market.  Heating oil makes up around

         17    10 percent of the total distillate market

         18    and, of course, the big one in the distillate

         19    side is on-highway and off-highway diesel

         20    fuel.  So we're looking residential prices

         21    and they each are now a part of those two

         22    markets.

          1              For an overview of propane

          2    residential propane consumption is biggest in

          3    the midwest followed by the south, less so in

          4    the west and the northeast.  One reason for

          5    modeling residential propane prices is there

          6    are large differences in propane prices

          7    across regions ranging from an average $1.54

          8    in the northeast to a $1.05 in the midwest.

          9    So whereas we maybe reporting a $1.20 average

         10    propane price for those in the northeast

         11    you're wondering what the heck you're doing.

         12              So hopefully going to the regional

         13    gives us a bit better view of regional

         14    differences but we're only doing the four

         15    major census regions.  We're not trying to go

         16    down to the district levels so we're at a

         17    much more aggregate although regionalized

         18    level in these models.

         19              On the heating oil side heating oil

         20    is far and away dominated by the northeast.

         21    Heating oil demand in the other sectors of

         22    the country is much less.  Not as much of a

          1    difference in heating oil prices across the

          2    regions from a $1.38 in the northeast to a

          3    $1.24 in the Midwest.  Heating oil is going

          4    to be much more closely tied to diesel fuel

          5    prices so you don't have the big regional

          6    price differences.  Again, we're modeling

          7    residential prices in the four major census

          8    regions.  We're not trying to bring it down

          9    any further than that at least at this point.

         10              So what I want to do is cover the

         11    four major areas of the model, residential

         12    consumption, inventories, wholesale price,

         13    and retail price.  Our target or objective on

         14    these two models is really residential prices

         15    and the estimation of consumption and

         16    inventories is really in support of

         17    estimating retail prices.

         18              And the approach I'm taking is very

         19    simple.  It's a reduced ———— model.  Since

         20    these residential markets only make up 10 or

         21    25 percent of the total demand we're not

          4    flows and the demands in the other sectors.

          5              Residential consumption, the

          6    primary purpose is to weight residential

          7    prices to come up with an annual average.  We

          8    have to weight them by the monthly volumes.

          9    And also to create a US aggregate price where

         10    we have to weight the regional prices by

         11    demand.

         12              We're using residential consumption

          1    distribution of the households?

          2              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Well, we're going

          3    to point out a real problem that if you even

          4    go into that detail on households there's no

          5    way.  When I approached this model one of the

          6    problems is that demand is very seasonal.

          7    During the winter propane demand or heating

          8    oil demand is going to be up towards the

          9    order of a million barrels a day.  During the

         10    summer it's on the order of a hundred

         11    thousand barrels a day.  So one of the

         12    problems I faced is that when we're talking

         13    about an increase in price the winter impact

         14    is going to be a lot larger than the summer

         15    impact.  Same thing with the number of homes.

         16              So my first stab at this was simply

         17    splitting out the price series into a winter

         18    series and a summer series and estimating

         19    separate coefficients and, of course, this is

         20    not a very good way of doing it and I'll show

         21    you in a bit more detail what I mean here.

         22    But I've got these slides for each of these

          2    co-efficient and a standardized beta co-

          3    efficient.  For the standardized beta

          4    co-efficient it's a one standard deviation

          5    and the explanatory variable times the

          6    co-efficient yields, how many standard

          7    deviations in the dependant variable.  So the

          8    standardized beta co-efficient is going to be

          9    an order of magnitude of importance.

         10              The winter price, very important as

         11    an explanatory variable, a higher price,

         12    lower demand.  The number of homes is an

         13    important explanatory variable.  These are

         14    all consistent with what we expect.  The

         15    summer variable's not very important because

         16    you've got a small demand, you're going to

         17    have a small change in a small number, and

         18    it's going to be hard to show up.

         19              First issue I ran into for

         20    residential consumption is we've got to

         22    survey and not a universe and every several

          1    years they change the survey frame where they

          2    do a frame survey and from that frame survey

          3    they take their sample.  So consequently

          4    there are changes in the data series every

          5    few years or so.

          6              The housing data, the problem is

          7    we're only talking less than 10 percent of

          8    the total market and again for the

          9    residential energy consumption survey it's a

         10    sample so we're taking the sample of a small

         11    market, not a big problem in natural gas, a

         12    big problem in propane and heating oil, and

         13    I've got some numbers to show exactly what's

         14    going on there.  And, again, I mentioned the

         15    problem with price elasticities.

         18    in demand for the middle Atlantic and the New

         19    England census regions.  And you can see up

         20    through 2003, from 2002 to 2003, there was a

         21    big jump in demand in both regions and this

         22    can even be pinpointed to a number of states

          3              All I can do is attribute this to a

          4    change in the survey frame and the only way I

          5    can deal with this is really I put in a dummy

          6    variable for all months before 2003 and then

          7    all months after 2003.  So you run into this

          8    kind of thing as you really have to look

          9    closely at the numbers you're dealing with

         10    and you can have a change in the series that

         11    can't be explained by any change in market,

         12    weather, or anything else.

         13              The way I tried to handle this

         14    winter-summer business, of course, it's

         15    obvious that this is not going to work, is I

         16    created a winter real price series and a

         17    summer real price series but, of course, it's

         18    not going to work when you're going from zero

         19    to 67 cents a gallon.

         20              And doing it this way, of course,

         21    gives me a very high price elasticity.  One

         22    solution I'm going to be dealing with is

          1    estimating demand as a function of

          2    expenditures where you're multiplying the

          3    price times the demand so that in the summer

          4    expenditures are going to be small, in the

          5    winter expenditures are going to be large.  I

          6    did a quick test on that and it's giving me

          7    much more reasonable price elasticities.  I

          8    would have expected -0.2 or even less than

          9    that.

         10              So this is a problem of bad

         11    specification that's easy enough to get

         12    around.  But now we have the same question

         13    coming up in the number of homes and the

         14    number of homes presents several problems.

         15    First the number of homes that use propane

         16    and heating oil comes from a survey that

         17    occurs only every four years, the residential

         18    energy consumption survey.

         19              So you can see we've got the

         20    residential energy consumption survey data

         21    points going 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001, I think

         22    again 2004.  We're coming up.  So we've got a

          1    monthly model that's one of the key variables

          2    only it carries maybe once in every four

          3    years and the best we could do is interpolate

          4    whether it is a linear.  We could be fancy

          5    and do a spline interpolation or something

          6    else.

          7              But nevertheless from this it looks

          8    like okay, you can come up with some kind of

          9    smooth series that is not going to give you

         10    too much indigestion but if you look at it,

         11    say, a different way between 1993 and 1997

         12    the heating oil and propane market shares in

         13    the Northeast census district were pretty

         14    stable.  All of a sudden into the 2001 survey

         15    you've got a big shift and from 2001 on out

         16    we are back to a stable market.

         17              This doesn't give you a whole lot

         18    of confidence so if we look further at the

         19    data we can see that if we break out the

         20    number of homes by propane and heating oil in

         21    the northeast we've got four hundred thousand

         22    homes.  From the survey the 95 percent

          1    confidence interval is four hundred thousand

          2    homes plus or minus 50 percent, for heating

          3    oil a little bit better, northeast 6.2

          4    million homes plus or minus 24 percent, so

          5    obviously we've got problems in using the

          6    data.

          7              Now, this brings up my question of

          8    how do you relate demand to the number of

          9    houses.  What we would have done to get

         10    around the problem of the winter-summer is

         11    for the dependent variable have demand per

         12    household.  So it would have taken total

         13    demand and divide it by the total number of

         14    households.

         15              Given the quality or the accuracy

         16    of the data that's not something I could do.

         17    I couldn't take total demand, which we'd

         18    expect some reasonably high accuracy, and

         19    divide it by the number of homes because a

         20    sample survey has a low level of accuracy.

         21    So I've got total demand regressed against

         22    the number of homes and then I run into the

          2    the effect in the winter is going to be much

          3              Inventories, I don't have

          4    inventories by census district so what I have

          5    to do is model inventories by the Petroleum

          6    Administration for Defense district, PADD

          7    district, which have five districts in the

          8    country.  So there's not a perfect match-up

          9    for inventories to census regions so I had to

         10    make an approximation that in the northeast

         11    that's going to be represented by PADD

         12    District 1, which is the east coast, the

         13    midwest is PADD District 2, which is the

         18    necessarily for statistical reasons but it's

          2    first forecast month came up with completely

          3    unreasonable import numbers.  So modeling

          5    out over that problem that I have much less

          6    of a problem between the transition from

          8              So modeling inventories as a

          6    getting into the important area since

          7    consumption was used more for weighting,

          8    inventories are more used as a right hand

          9    side variable in prices, so now we're really

         10    getting into the hearts of the propane and

         11    heating oil models.  We're starting out with

         12    a wholesale price and a wholesale price is

         13    estimated as differentials to crude oil

         15              Let me give a bit more explanation

         16    of what I'm doing here.  I originally modeled

         17    wholesale price as a function of the current

         18    crude price and a one-month lag of the crude

         19    price because there is some delayed pass-

         20    through.  Even if it's only a week or two

         21    that still has a month to month effect.  The

         22    problem I was running into was I would have

          1    assumed that alpha 1 plus alpha 2 should have

          2    added up to 1.0, that the total crude price

          3    should be a one to one pass-through even if

          4    delayed.

          5              The problem I was running into is

          6    that my estimated alpha 1 and alpha 2 were a

          7    little bit larger than 1.0 and the result of

          8    that was as crude oil prices have shot up

          9    over the last year my forecast price premium

         10    or the price differential for wholesale was

         11    going up more than I would have liked.  So

         12    consequently my solution is either I can

         13    constrain alpha 1 plus alpha 2 to equal 1.0

         14    which is easy enough to do but an easier

         15    solution as far as doing it in EViews takes

         16    me a couple of less steps is I estimate

         17    wholesale price to crude oil price difference

         18    as a function of the current crude oil price

         19    minus crude oil price lagged one month.

         20              And what that does is the

         21    specification constrain alpha 1 and alpha 2

         22    to equal 1.0 and alpha 1 in the second

          1    equation, of course, represents the impact of

          2    the one-month lag price so that the current

          3    price if alpha 1 is 0.15 the current month

          4    crude oil price represents 85 percent of the

          5    wholesale price and the one-month lag price

          6    15 percent.  So the distillate price premium

          7    is estimated as a function of the WTI crude

          8    oil price difference, total US distillate

          9    demand, and beginning of month US distillate

         10    inventories.

         11              And for my standardized beta

         12    coefficients, the WTI, the most important

         13    variable turns out to be inventories and this

         14    is total US inventories.  I've tried

         15    different PADDs but it turns out total US is

         16    most important.  When inventories are low

         17    prices are higher or the price premium to

         18    crude oil is higher and vice versa.

         19              The WTI price difference, that's

         20    where I'm saying the minus 0.175 represents

         21    the lagged month impact on current wholesale

         22    prices so about 82 percent of the distillate

          4              US distillate demand, I could have

          6    to go in and instead of using demand number

          7    using heating degree-day deviations from

          8    normal.  I recall I tested that and there

          9    wasn't much difference but nevertheless when

         10    demand is higher whether it's from heating

         11    degree-days or the demand number itself

         16    several options.  There are lots of measures

         17    of wholesale prices.  For example, just

         18    looking at the propane sector, EIA reports

         19    from a survey a petrochemical sector price,

         20    which is the largest demand for propane in

         21    the country, almost 50 percent of the propane

         22    goes to the petrochemical market.  There are

          1    many measures of spot prices out there

          2    available.  Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Conway,

          3    Kansas, are the two major propane hubs in the

          4    country.  That's where most of the propane is

          5    stored.

          6              These are natural gas gathering

          7    plants where you've got the natural gas

          8    liquids plants.  They're recovering propane

          9    from the natural gas and you've got

         10    underground storage in Mont Belvieu, Texas.

         11    You've got single underground storage domes,

         12    salt dome storage wells, that hold up to a

         13    million barrels of propane each.  So the spot

         14    prices in Mont Belvieu, and Conway, Kansas

         16              What I did was I tested wholesale

         17    prices against each of these and found out

          1    average price to the market.  You can have a

          2    high spot price at which you have few or no

          3    sellers and you can have a low spot price

          4    where you have a lot of sellers.  Anyway the

          5    petrochemical sector price actually

          6    represents a consumption- weighted price and

          7    using the petrochemical sector price to

          8    explain regional retail prices gave much

          9    better results than a spot price.

         10              So now we get to the retail

         11    residential prices and again I estimate these

         12    as first differences, the difference between

         13    the retail price and the wholesale market

         14    price, so I'm estimating all the prices as

         15    markup starting from wholesale over crude and

         16    retail over wholesale.  So the difference

         17    between residential retail price and

         18    wholesale price is a function of the

         19    difference between the current and previous

         20    month wholesale price, inventories, and

         21    heating degree-days.

          1    only variable you need to explain the retail

          2    price is the wholesale price in just about

          3    every region.  Inventories have little effect

          4    on the difference between retail and

          5    wholesale prices.  Weather or demand has very

          6    little effect on the difference between

          7    retail and wholesale prices in the propane

          8    and heating oil residential markets.  It was

          9    a little bit of a surprise result to me,

         10    surprised me a little bit, but it's a very

         11    stable relationship between retail prices and

         12    wholesale price.  So once you've explained

         13    the wholesale price you've pretty much

         14    explained the retail price.

         15              The problem that we have in the

         16    residential retail price my big issue again

         17    is data, that if we look at this first

         18    difference or the difference between the

         19    residential price and the wholesale price you

         20    can see up through January '01 or at January

         21    '01, around there, there was a big shift in

         22    the series.  For the US there was a 12-cent

          3    the regions.

          5    theoretically or anything happening in the

          6    market.  Again it's a problem with we're

          7    dealing with a sample that's reframed every

          8    two, three, or four years so I've got to deal

          9    with this through simply dummy variables.

         11              DR. FEDER:  I just want to refer to

         12    the issue with the changing frames.

         13              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Yes.

         14              DR. FEDER:  Tanc, you probably know

         15    the data much better than I so I don't know

         16    if its feasible but I wonder if one could not

         17    calculate the same estimates based on the

         18    common part of the two frames just to

         19    estimate the change of frame bias?

         20              MR. LIDDERDALE:  I would say you

         21    could.  The question is is it worth it and

         22    can we catch the numbers that easily.

          1              DR. FEDER:  I have a biased

          2    preference here but I hold the view that

          3    sometimes measure of change is much more

          4    important than measure of level and

          5    especially when you deal with data that are

          6    so volatile and affecting the markets.  So I

          7    think yes, I think it's very important to

          8    know if the change is a true change or is it

          9    an artifact of the same.

         10              MR. LIDDERDALE:  That's an

         11    excellent point.

         12              MS. KIRKENDALL:  A question,

         13    though, is this from the 782 survey?

         14              MR. LIDDERDALE:  The prime

         15    supplier?  No, 782, yes, it is.

         16              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Because I thought

         17    that they did a redesign of the sampling

         18    methodology sometime too.  It may be it was

         19    in January of 2001.

         20              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Yes, I think

         21    that's what it is.

          1    frame every four years and that's one thing

          2    but they also did a totally new sample

          3    design.  So that's probably a bigger thing

          4    than the frame update.

          5              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Yes, obviously,

          6    because we only have the one shift, the one

          7    intervention.  I attributed it to a change in

          8    the frame but obviously I'm not that familiar

          9    with the data and your point's well taken but

         10    if it's a change in the sampling method --

         11              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I only know that

         12    they did have a big change in the sampling

         13    method.  They'd used the same method for

         14    years and years and years and sometime in

         15    that early 2000s they switched.  It will be

         16    interesting to find out if it was in January

         17    '01 because I don't remember the date.

         18              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Most of the time

         19    when I see something like this I go and say I

         20    want the original data so I want to see

         21    what's happening.  Obviously I haven't done

         22    this for propane and heating oil.

          1              DR. FEDER:  I think it's too costly

          3    parallel run so you can measure the redesign

          4    effect which sometimes people do but I --

          5              MR. CLEVELAND:  I assume you have a

          6    time machine.

          7              DR. FEDER:  We need a time machine

          8    here but one could still take the old design

          9    and just calculate the inclusion

         10    probabilities for those units that were

         11    included and this way estimate the effect of

         12    the redesign.  That may be too much, I don't

         13    know, and maybe the historical value in '01

         14    is not that important any more but in general

         15    even if it might be prohibitively costly to

         16    actually take an independent sample using the

         17    two designs it's still not, I think, too much

         18    to at least calculate the inclusion

         19    probabilities and calculate estimates because

         20    that's only math, its not actual collection,

          3    dealing with the same issue now right now.

          4              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Another issue too

          5    is that the difference between pre- and post-

          6    January '01 is more than simply a level

          7    shift, that the whole seasonality could have

          8    changed so it's almost that you want to start

          9    the estimation period at January '01 or

         10    compare regressions of the two periods

         11    separately to see if in fact it's simply a

         12    level shift or you've got changes in other

         13    underlining other underlining character-

         18    the data that I have here and I see that the

         19    US uses 1.07 billion tons of coal to me it's

         20    almost like an incomprehensible number.  It's

          7    might suggest that if you could normalize

          8    these numbers by something, I mean, like a

          9    ratio estimate, going just back to what Moshe

         10    knows about, then it might actually be able

         11    to disappear these artifacts because, I mean,

         12    you think well, I'm measuring something

         13    slightly different because I have a different

         14    sampling strategy but by measuring more than

         15    one thing I'll make sample units.

         16              And so, the hope is that maybe

         17    there is some characteristic with which these

         18    numbers are associated that could explain

         19    this dramatic shift.  I don't know what it

         20    is.  It's a wild thought that if you have

          6    statistical issue is a huge one here and the

          7    issue of levels.  A lot of these data that

          8    you're estimating in levels have time trends

          9    and there is no talk here about whether there

         10    is a stochastic ———————————— time trends of

         11    these data.  If the variables co-integrate it

         13    squares which may be, frankly, completely

         14    inappropriate if these things have stochastic

         15    time trends.  You need to test these data for

         19    the levels.

          6    variable that are estimated in levels has

          7    this issue and so I think it's something that

          8    you need to look at.  You have a lot of

          9    insignificant coefficients.  Something's off

         10    somewhere.

         11              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Well, running into

         12    the insignificant coefficients, I had the

         13    problem in consumption, obviously.  That's a

         14    level with a time trend.  The first

         15    difference is are there wholesale over crude

         16    oil and retail that don't have a time trend

         17    problem there.  But I had insignificance on

         18    the retail over wholesale which was a

         19    surprising result but actually makes sense

         20    that those variables affect the wholesale

         21    market and not the retail.  So I've got

         22    problems that I need to find a solution for.

          4              MR. BERNSTEIN:  Well, I suppose

          5    this is my frustration on the time with this

          6    and this is back to Nancy and Bill at some

          7    level because I ask this every single time, I

          8    think, in the five years I've been here.  I

          9    don't know what your objective is.  I'm not

         10    sure what you are trying to do here so I

         11    don't know what to tell you to do on this

         17    forecast regional residential prices.  Number

         18    one, there are large differences in

         19    residential pricing across regions, propane

         20    going from a $1.05 up to a $1.50-something

         21    per gallon.  We want to be able to target

          3              MR. BERNSTEIN:  So your goal is to

          5    heating oil?

          6              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Exactly.

          7              MR. BERNSTEIN:  So the first step,

          8    I think, is what you've been trying to do,

          9    though I'm not sure why this way, is to

         10    understand on propane why there are regional

         11    differences, number one, and then on heating

         12    oil what drives wintertime heating oil price.

         13    First of all it seems to me you can ignore

         14    all the summertime stuff for heating oil.

         15    I'm not an econometrician so I'll be

         17    bother running those months at all in the

         18    model.  I would just run a winter heating oil

         19    model.

         20              But I'm also wondering if the only

         21    way for you to get that data is interpolating

         22    between RECS years maybe one needs to step

          2    of what drives the distillate price and then

          4    the residential portion of that.

          5              I mean, that's what you try to do

          6    but I'm not sure that the RECS data gets you

          7    anywhere there and I'm not sure the RECS data

          8    is going to get any better.  We'll hear about

          9    that later, I mean, and so the question is

         10    distillate price, what's driving that price

         11    in the wintertime and what portion of that is

         12    residential and is there a different set of

         13    data.

         14              We all read about heating oil

         15    prices and if it gets cold the heating oil

         16    prices go up but is it being driven by demand

         17    which you're indicating maybe not or is it

         18    driven by expectations in the market, and I'm

         19    not sure how you model that, where people are

         20    seeing winter prices going up and so the

         21    winter cold and so they're driving the base

         22    price up.

          1              So I don't know what to tell you

          2    here but I think that if we go back to my

          3    goal is price and my goal for heating oil is

          4    Northeast winter heating oil let's then focus

          5    on that and then figure out with the best

          6    data you can what's the best way to

          7    understand what drives those prices and I'm

          8    not sure you are there yet.

          9              And then on the propane all you're

         10    really interested in, it appears at this

         11    point, is regional differences and what

         12    drives those regional differences.  And maybe

         13    there is a different more aggregate approach

         14    to drive that.  My guess is not just

         15    residential propane prices that differ by

         16    region but also the petrochemical prices and

         17    every thing else and so do you need to

         18    differentiate the residential out of that to

         19    understand what drives differences in prices

         20    between regions.  I don't know the answer to

         21    those questions.

         18    the surprising result.

         19              MR. BERNSTEIN:  Well, that's

         20    probably because the wholesale price is going

          1    difference.

          2              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Well, the

          3    wholesale price is a US average wholesale

          4    price and so that's why I used aggregate

          5    demand instead of US heating degree-days or

          6    something but what we're saying is that

          7    wholesale price responds to weather and just

          8    because you're cold in the northeast and warm

          9    in the midwest doesn't mean the residential

         10    price over the wholesale price, that premium,

         11    goes up any more in the northeast.  To me was

         12    a surprising result.  I didn't expect that.

         13              And the whole effect on demand

         14    shocks weather shocks manifests itself in the

         15    wholesale price which to me is an interesting

         16    result in itself.

         17              MR. BERNSTEIN:  But if I take a

         18    look at that and if I assume in this one that

         19    it's just a frame or whatever issue there

         20    that if I look at those patterns and I just

         21    shift them it seems to me over time the

          1    wholesale price really hasn't changed much at

          2    all in that '95 to 2005 time period.

          3              So what it tells me is that the

          4    fact of the matter is that what's going to

          5    drive the price is not the fact that the

          6    northeast is cold is going to affect the

          7    residential price in the northeast.  It'll

          8    affect the wholesale price because traders

          9    are looking at that cold weather and they're

         10    going to bring up their wholesale price

         19    It's not data?

         16              MR. LIDDERDALE:  We've got the

         17    demand which, of course, this is the

         18    problematic regression here but consumption

         19    heating degree-days statistically significant

          4    apart from the price, which was a problematic

          5    variable, so given a better specification

          6    it's going to change a little.  But heating

          8    expected and that's about all I can say at

          9    this point.

         10              DR. HENGARTNER:  Winter number of

         11    homes, that you said was actually a very

         12    unreliable number?

         13              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Well, it's worse

         14    than that.  Instead of winter real price we

         15    call it winter number of homes and that's

         16    what the series looks like.  So the series is

         17    mis-specified and I don't have a better

         18    specification because I can't create demand

         19    per household.  And I can't do that because

          4              DR. HENGARTNER:  And the impact of

          5    various in variables, and I think economists

          6    are strong on that, is that you have an

          7    attenuation.  That means the impact on your

          8    regression coefficient is that the estimates

          9    are smaller than they ought to be and maybe

         10    that explains why when you just use standard

         11    regression methods you look at the estimates

         12    and, lo and behold, they're not significant.

         13    Well, yes, what do you expect?  I mean, you

         14    had too much noise in the co-variants.  It's

         15    a dangerous thing to make those adjustments.

         16    You make an adjustment based on assumptions

         17    that are hard to verify but this may be one

         18    of the causes of why something that you

         19    expected to happen didn't.

         20              MR. LIDDERDALE:  But as we're

         22    to me is much more reliable data.  So it's a

          5              It's something I wasn't expecting

          8    estimating a couple of these equations in

          4    There's wood too, I guess, so --

          6    very small?  I use wood, wood and natural

          7    gas, but I still think it's a small number of

          8    homes.  Actually it's only in the more rural

          4    interesting stuff where we've actually

          5    changed that and see big differences and what

          6    happens if it's 60?  So I'd think about

          7    looking at the sensitivity of that variable

          8    at some level.  I would certainly forget all

          9    the summer stuff.  If you're only worried

         10    about winter and if you're talking about the

         11    short-term energy you don't have to do it

         16              And then the heating oil, that's

         17    easy.  On the propane it's almost similar.

         18    You're really only caring about the other

         19    relationship so also I think you don't need

         20    to care so much about the number of

         21    households.  You need to try to uncover

          3    not just residential prices, on propane.  Do

          8    variable in prices of heating degree-days

          9    this works better.  The only reason we're

          6    you're going to do it regionally anyway and

         17    price makes sense for the US because that's

          1    average may not be worth the effort.

          2              MR. LIDDERDALE:  If we're using

          3    retail price to measure an average

          4    profitability for the country for the

          5    industry then you may want a US average but

          6    we're not really doing that.

          7              MS. ANDERSON:  We typically don't

          8    report that kind of information.  What we

          9    typically report in the wintertime is some

         10    sense of what regions are paying for heating,

         11    and convert that to an expenditure.  But what

         12    we try to derive from the national data now

         13    are expenditures by regions so clearly our

         14    focus is on getting regional richness about

         15    heating fuel.

         20    that difference amongst all the other prices?

          7    among, say, petrochemical or other uses of

          8    propane then you don't need to go through the

         10    what do you have?  You have the chemical

         11    sector and the commercial sector.  You

         12    probably have better price data there and do

          1    example, for propane over natural gas.  I

          2    mean, aren't the profits and the markups the

          7              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Well, propane is

          8    fascinating in its relationship with crude

          9    oil and natural gas which I didn't get into

         10    because it's related to both.  Now, if crude

         11    oil is moving up faster or higher than

         12    natural gas, propane moves up with it but not

         13    in lock step.

         14              MR. BERNSTEIN:  But the question is

         15    between regions are there similarities to

         16    other fuels, do you see similar patterns of

         17    regional differences, and try to use that to

          2    were explained only in your model by the

          3    wholesale price differences.  Why were you

          4    surprised by that?

          5              MR. LIDDERDALE:  Because this cold

          6    weather in the northeast I would have

          7    expected, say, inventories to go low in the

          8    northeast relative to the Gulf Coast which

          9    would put pressure on the wholesale price but

         10    it puts even more pressure on the retail

         11    price.  That's why I expected some response

         12    in the markup and I didn't see that.

         13              MR. BERNSTEIN:  I think what you're

         14    seeing in terms of the trading anticipation

         15    there is that once they see those stocks

         16    going down the wholesale price drives up.

         17    There's no room for the retail price to go.

         18    Once they drive the wholesale price up the

         19    market won't accept more.  The retail guys

         20    are getting squeezed all the time.  You hear

         21    the same thing from refiners.  The refining

         22    guys say that they're squeezed all the time

          1    because when everybody sees a shortage in

          2    gasoline what happens is crude oil prices go

          3    up, gasoline prices go up, but to the same

          4    ratio and the refiners continue to get

          5    squeezed.  They don't make more money.

          6              And I think you're having the same

          7    thing in the residential as you're having in

          8    the gasoline and it's the market anticipation

          9    at some level driving the base price up and

         10    so you don't have any room for that.  So I'm

         11    not surprised by that.

         16    about it, that certainly makes sense.

          4    there was a bunch of discussion about making

          5    sure you use changes or differences rather

          1              DR. HENGARTNER:  Thank you very

          2    much, Mark.  We'll go right away with the

          3    next item on the agenda which is a discussion

          4    follow-up on frame team activities by Howard.

          5    Welcome.

          6              MR. BRADSHER-FREDRICK:  Today I'm

          7    going to talk about the most recent

          8    activities of the frames team.  You'll

          9    remember in the 2004 sessions some of us

         10    presented information about EIA frames

         11    activities.  Also you heard a presentation

         12    from the Census Bureau this morning related

         13    to frames comparisons.

         14              This is an outline of my

         15    presentation.  I'll begin by discussing some

         16    background information.  Then I'll remind you

         17    about previous efforts of the frames team.

         18    After that I'll talk about the more recent

         19    efforts of the frames team including our work

         20    on frame sufficiency and the results of that

         21    work and from there I'll talk about possible

         22    new directions for the team and finally get

          1    to the questions for the committee.

          2              The EIA strategic plan provides the

          3    basis for the frames team's activities, it

          4    provides the impetus for increasing

          5    efficiencies in frames usage, and it calls

          6    for performance measures concerning

          7    sufficiency of frames.  The actual language

          8    in the strategic plan is percent of EI survey

          9    frames with sufficient industry coverage to

         10    produce reliable supply, demand, and price

         11    statistics.

         12              I'll briefly summarize the previous

         13    frames team efforts.  At both of the meetings

         14    last year there were presentations discussing

         15    frame-checking activities at the respondent

         16    level.  That work included comparing National

         17    Renewable Energy Lab plant-level data with

         18    EIA electric power plant data.  It also

         19    included checking petroleum supply data with

         20    MECS consumption data and comparing EIA power

         21    plant data with EI coal consumption data.

         22              Shawna Waugh discussed the proposed

          1    work for conducting data comparisons with the

          2    Census Bureau and you heard an interim report

          3    about that this morning.  Some data

          4    comparisons at the aggregated level were also

          5    discussed.  We compared petroleum marketing

          6    data with consumer price index data.

          7              The balancing item with respect to

          8    natural gas supply versus disposition data

          9    was also discussed and for price data we

         10    described our comparison of volumes that the

         11    price data represented in comparison with

         12    total volumes.  This was done with natural

         13    gas commercial price data.  And at the last

         14    fall meeting we discussed the dual system

         15    methodology.  As was recommended by the

         16    committee, we'll be presenting our work on

         17    this topic at the FCSM research conference

         18    this November.

         19              Now I'll discuss more recent

         20    activities of the frames team.  During the

         21    last six months of last year we evaluated all

         22    of EIA's master frames for sufficiency.  We

          1    employed these criteria, the existence of a

          2    systematic maintenance approach, and you

          3    notice that these are fairly qualitative

          4    things, frame volatility over time, the use

          5    of comparable frame listings from other

          6    sources, the existence of a balancing item,

          7    the magnitude and stability of the balancing

          8    item over time, the relative concentration of

          9    volumes in a few respondents, and the changes

         10    in the industry or changes to legislation and

         11    regulations, also independent assessment by

         12    the survey manager of the frame's quality.

         13              So we had to go and collect a lot

         14    of information in addition to fairly a basic

         15    frame information and if you've seen the

         16    paper on the Intranet that Bill had out, I

         17    mean, there are long appendices in the paper

         18    and these are all included in Appendices A

         19    through D but basically the information is

         20    stability or volatility of the frame, the

         21    corresponding useful listings of frame units,

         22    whether EIA has access to them, the balancing

          2    of volume in a few respondents to the skewed

          3    distributions.

          4              So we looked at a total of 34

          5    frames and five were deemed to be out of

          6    scope so we looked at 29 that we regard as

          7    within the team's purview and we deemed 25

          8    sufficient and four were deemed either

          9    insufficient or don't know and those four

         10    were the EIA 815, the Monthly Terminal

         11    Blenders Report.  This is a fairly new frame.

         12    It's difficult to identify blenders of

         13    gasoline and there is no reliable

         14    comprehensive registry for comparison

         15    purposes though we know that the EPA is

         16    presently working on one.

         17              The EIA 910, the Monthly Natural

         18    Gas Marketers Report, is also a fairly new

         19    frame.  Again, it's difficult to identify

         20    marketers and new states are being added

         21    often so this frame is in a state of flux.

         22    Also the EIA 886 is the Annual Survey of

          2    Users and there's been difficulty in

          3    identifying and collecting data from fleets

          4    owned by private nonutility companies and

          5    local governments and these fleets could have

          6    quite a few alternative fueled vehicles.  EIA

          7    is presently looking at changes to the law

          8    that would facilitate easier and more

          9    accurate data collections on the 886.

         11    Quarterly Coal Consumptions and Quarterly

         12    Report, Manufacturing Plants.  The balancing

         13    item shows that this frame is fairly good but

         14    there have been some questions regarding

         15    whether procedures are in place to maintain

         16    quality over time and, as was mentioned this

         17    morning again, the Census Bureau will shortly

         18    be conducting a data comparison with the

         19    EIA 3 so we'll get some more information on

         20    that.

          1    completed our study we realized that there

          2    could be alternative ways of proceeding that

          3    might be even perhaps more useful to EIA.

          4    EIA may want to determine sufficiency by

          5    survey rather than by master frame.

          6              Let me explain a little bit.

          7    Subsets of some EIA master frames serve a

          8    number of different surveys.  For example,

          9    the 860, the Annual Electric Generator

         10    Report, serves as a master frame for a number

         11    of surveys including the 920.  This is the

         12    Combined Heat and Power Plant Report.  While

         13    the team deemed the 860 sufficient it may be

         14    that the 920 frame would have to be more

         15    thoroughly scrutinized for sufficiency if we

         16    reevaluate it separately.

         17              In terms of the pros of changing

         18    the approach it could be that it'd be more

         19    useful to EIA to look at individual survey

         20    frames.  And in terms of the cons we'd be

         21    looking at perhaps 67 surveys as opposed to

         22    29 master frames.  And also there may be some

          1    question from the strategic plan about what

          2    we really mean about frame sufficiency.  Is

          3    it to look at master frames or what is it

          4    that we're really trying to accomplish with

          5    this?

          6              In terms of the new activities of

          7    the frames team we got started in February

          8    with another team essentially adding on to

          9    work that's already been going on including

         10    the sufficiency work but the new charter that

         11    we developed has these objectives to work

         12    toward a long-term goal of enhanced

         13    commonality in information technology, to

         14    identify opportunities to share frame

         15    information, to monitor the quality of EIA

         16    frames, recommend needed enhancements to

         17    frames, recommend surveys to be discontinued

         18    or that results tables be provided with

         19    appropriate caveats, also to recommend

         20    further studies needed to evaluate frame

         21    sufficiencies, and to prepare updated

         22    recommendations for the frame sufficiency

          3    March and we had a short interim report which

          5    recommendations of what the team's activity

          6    should be in the future.  And we prioritized

          7    some things and we gave a high priority to

          8    completing and maintaining an inventory of

          9    EIA frames.  We also thought that we should

         10    conduct quarterly meetings or special

         11    meetings as the need arises among affected or

         12    interested offices to aid and frame

         13    information sharing and we should also have

         14    as a high priority to study and update frame

         15    documentation standards.

         16              In terms of medium priority items

         17    we recommended to develop best practices for

         18    system maintenance, support, and flexibility

         19    of system designs with regard to frames and

         20    to look into replacing the existing standard

         21    on frames maintenance and develop a revised

         22    version.

         17    the final question in the earlier break-out

         18    session, should the frame be reviewed every

         19    five years, and I was wondering did the team

         20    think about it, the frames team think about

         21    that question, and what is your thinking?

          1    think we've really gotten into details of

          2    that type.  I mean, one of the questions, of

          3    course, that we have is well, how often

          4    should we even be looking at the sufficiency

          5    question.  I mean, it is in the strategic

          6    plan so we are going to have to do this on a

          7    periodic basis.

          8              But, I mean, if you looked at the

          9    70 pages you'd see about half of this as

         10    tables and this was a big effort to put this

         11    together.  I mean, it may be that the first

         12    time is the hardest time and things will get

         13    easier with future iterations but this is

         14    this is still a resource-intensive thing.

         15    And while some good things may come out of it

         16    it may be something we don't want to do too

         17    often.

         18              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I think the team

         19    that did the evaluation recommended that it

         20    be done at least no more often than every

         21    three years.  They felt three years might not

         22    be a bad cycle for taking a look at the

          1    frames.  That didn't have to do so much with

          2    getting the Census Bureau to look at specific

          3    frames.  That was an internal EIA process.

          4              DR. HENGARTNER:  Was there any

          5    thought when you updated or changed a frame

          6    to carry over the old frame at least for one

          7    more cycle or have the frames overlap because

          8    we have had that issue several times and it

          9    comes up again and again?  Each time you

         10    changed a frame or you changed something the

         11    whole series shifts and it would be nice to

         12    have some idea on how that occurs.

         13              MS. KIRKENDALL:  I don't think that

         14    Tanc was right on that.  I really don't think

         15    that it was a frame change.  There was

         16    probably a survey change.  But I think there

         17    needs to be more looking at that because

         18    usually when we do these frames maintenance

         19    it doesn't make that big a difference.  You

         20    usually just find a few more units to add.

         21              MR. CLEVELAND:  I used a DOE series

         22    on oil and gas reserves.  In 1977 there was a

          1    major change where historically time series

          2    data on the amount of oil and gas discovered

          3    in the United States by different types of

          4    categories and for years, going back to the

          5    '40s, the American Petroleum Institute

          6    published this data.

          7              In 1977 when the DOE was formed

          8    there was a shift.  API said DOE's going to

          9    do this.  We're going to stop doing it.  And

         10    the ways in which they collected the data

         11    were fundamentally different.  So if you

         12    plotted the two series and they overlap by a

         13    couple of years there are these big

         14    differences and this was a very widely used

         15    series, high profile series.

         16              And so actually  EIA, I believe,

         17    supported two studies, one by Richard

         18    Nehring, an independent consultant in oil and

         19    gas, and another one internally where they

         20    came up with two different fudging factors,

         21    algorithms, to link the two series using

         22    different assumptions.  One was a more

          1    statistical based and one was a subjective

          2    thing where Richard Nehring went in on a

          3    field by field level and tried to calibrate

          4    the two.

          5              And so something like that in

          6    series that are really important it might be

          7    worth your while to try when there's a break

          8    in the series to actually pay some attention

          9    to bridging the series in some kind of

         10    meaningful way that statisticians can look at

         11    and understand because that work was really

         12    important that they did in that particular

         13    series.

         14              DR. HENGARTNER:  And the problem is

         19    require having a separate sample.  You just

         20    need to have a separate set of rates

          4    both frames in existence so you can get that

          6              Any more questions and comments?

          7              DR. FEDER:  I have a question.  Do

          8    you get some information from, let's say, on

          9    a given survey or a census from another

         10    regarding the sufficiency of the frame?

         11    Because some of the data collections are

         12    related such as suppliers and consumers and

         13    so on is there a way you can assess the

         17    these presentations, say, last year there

         18    were some comparisons that were mentioned

         19    like the MECS versus petroleum supply and

         20    things of this type.

          1    of comparison, also the balancing item that

          2    we've talked about, and you didn't

          3    particularly like that but that's trying to

          4    measure the same concept in different ways

          5    from different surveys so then if you get

          6    close balancing supply from one survey and

          7    consumption from another it gives you a

          8    warmer feeling about you're actually getting

          9    the information you want from the two

         10    surveys.  I mean, in almost all of the fuel

         11    areas they spend a fair amount of time

         12    looking at balancing items to try to make

         16    because it seemed to us like the balancing

         17    item showed the data to be fairly good.  If

          1              MR. BRADSHER-FREDRICK:  I would say

          2    so.  I mean, surely there are some problems,

          3    as we point out, but I think they're in

          4    pretty good shape but we just need to keep

          5    after it.  And it could be that some of these

          6    suggestions we made about what the team might

          7    do to try to get better cooperation between

          8    offices so that people learn from each other,

          9    this could be helpful too.

         10              DR. SITTER:  Well, I think that you

         11    also learn what kinds of things, what kinds

         12    of situations, you're having frame problems

         13    in like new frames, for example, and certain

         14    things and so I think that the important

         15    thing is to be intelligent and there's no way

         16    you can do this every year or every three

         17    years.  I mean, it's just too intensive, I

         18    imagine, too costly, and there's no reason

         19    to.

         20              MR. BRADSHER-FREDRICK:  It's also a

          1    that we're asking.

          2              DR. SITTER:  So I think that

          3    basically you've got to use a quality control

          4    strategy that attacks the big problems with

          5    more energy, and the small ones less

          6    frequently.  That's the most important.

          7    Otherwise you're just going to be spending

          8    way too much effort on things that you're

          9    pretty sure are not a problem.

         10              MS. KIRKENDALL:  So we might

         11    conclude once we're done with this that maybe

         12    our frames are okay and move on to some other

         13    aspect of quality that probably isn't so

         14    good.

         15              DR. SITTER:  Well, I think I would

         16    look at it more on a survey by survey basis

         17    or frame by frame basis but clearly there are

         18    some well-established ones.  You're pretty

         19    sure the frame isn't changing quickly.  You

         20    can determine that fairly fast.  Then

         21    certainly that shouldn't be revisited as

         22    often as where you know that you've got

          1    something that's changing or, like you said,

          2    the ones you've identified you probably could

          3    have identified a priori at least three of

          4    them.

          5              You already knew it was hard to get

          6    at these frames.  These are hard frames so

          7    you knew that those you should be focusing

          8    on.  And I think that you've probably learned

          9    a little bit about certain specific things

         10    where you probably didn't know you should

         11    have been focusing on those.  And I think

          1    about that because we know people are keeping

          2    it up to date in fairly routine ways.

          3              DR. SITTER:  It's like if you do

          4    the six sigma stuff for quality control when

          5    they come in to an industry the very first

          6    thing that they say is take your quality

          7    characteristics and histogram them and those

          8    causing you the most grief you attack first.

          9    It's very simple but you get a lot of

         10    low-hanging fruit that way and I think that

         11    cost versus benefit is really the thing when

         12    it comes to quality.

         13              DR. FEDER:  Howard, I may have

         14    misunderstood one of the ideas that you had

         15    there but, using surveys as frames, what did

         16    you mean by that?

         17              MR. BRADSHER-FREDRICK:  Well, we

         18    really meant that some of these surveys are

         19    taking pieces of various frames and even

         20    doing cutoff sampling and things like that

         21    and they may or may not be doing it quite the

         22    right way in some cases.  And, like I've

          1    mentioned the 920, I think this is something

          2    that a lot of people bring up, that it could

          3    be that it's hard to identify.  We may really

          4    be missing some combined heat and power

          5    plants.  The 860 looks pretty good but it

          6    could be that that section of the 860 isn't

          7    so good.  So some of the subsets may not be

          8    so great.

          9              DR. SITTER:  You mean in actually

         10    obtaining the correct subset from an uncut

         11    frame?

         12              MR. BRADSHER-FREDRICK:  Yes, and

         13    how things are drawn from the --

         14              MS. KIRKENDALL:  No, the 860 is

         15    both a frame and it's an annual survey and it

         16    goes down to generator level and gets detail

         17    about electricity generation.  And the frames

         18    team particularly was looking at it's just a

         19    highly skewed distribution.  Are you

         20    capturing most of it?  And we almost

         21    certainly are because there are so many huge

         22    generators.

          1              So the survey itself is fine and

          2    it's a fine frame to use for monthly surveys,

          3    a frame, which is the list of respondents and

          4    perhaps those that are not active now.  If

          5    you're going to the big guys but if your

          6    focus, like the 920, is on combined heat and

          7    power plants that's a focus on the companies

          8    that are at the small end of that frame.  And

          9    that's where I'd expect that frame to be less

         10    complete just because it's harder to get a

         11    complete list of little companies than it is

         12    to get a list of the bigger companies.

         13              DR. SITTER:  That's an issue

         14    between coverage in terms of item-wise

         15    coverage versus coverage in terms of ——————

         16    of the volume.

         17              DR. FEDER:  So what's the proposal

         18    then?

         19              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Oh, well, my

         20    proposal is that we really need an evaluation

         21    of the frame for each survey.  So the frame

         22    for the 920 is a subset of the 860 and the

          1    860 should be evaluated as a frame for the

          2    920 separately rather than saying is the 860

          3    a good enough frame.  And that's not how we

          4    approached it this time but I think that's

          5    not so bad.  We had to start somewhere but

          6    maybe in the future we need to go back.

          7              Now, it turns out that that's what

          8    the Census Bureau is going to be doing for us

          9    anyway.  So we are going to get that

         10    evaluation back from them.

         11              DR. SITTER:  And that falls into a

         12    similar category.  You obviously have a lot

         13    of intuition as to which one of your frames

         14    are going to be a problem and you should be

         15    using that and those you should be checking

         16    first.

         17              DR. HENGARTNER:  Not only that but

         18    you also know how much trouble they're going

         19    to cause.  And so a blanket statement saying

         20    let's revise them every three years is

         21    probably not the right answer.  It's going to

         22    depend on, as Randy said, which frames change

          3    smarter about what we look at.

          4              DR. SITTER:  And some of the work

          5    is as a one-shot deal in some sense; that is,

          6    if it is that you've got poor coverage now

          7    but it's fairly stable over time then what

          8    you really need to do is fix it now and then

          9    you don't have to check it that often.  But

         10    others that may have good coverage now but

         11    are not stable have to be checked a lot.  It

         12    just depends.

         13              DR. FEDER:  I don't think my

         14    question is fully justified in this context

         15    but I just wonder do you have any

         16    longitudinal component of any of the surveys?

         17    Is any unit observed for more than one time

         18    deliberately to measure change or anything

         19    like that?

         20              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Most of our

         21    surveys are longitudinal panel surveys.  We

         22    have a wealth of data at the company level.

          1    If the company's been in business we've

          5    that is because one of the things that are

          6    easy to miss is new what they call birth and

          7    death of units, plants, and whatever and I

          8    think in the business world there's also, of

          9    course, the issue of mergers and acquisitions

         10    and change in organization and splits too.

         11              MR. BRADSHER-FREDRICK:  That was

         12    some of the data that we collected in those

         13    tables, for each of the frames, births and

         14    deaths and mergers, how many do you see per

         15    time period, to give us some sense as to the

         16    stability of the frame over time.  So that

         17    was a factor that we looked at in terms of

         18    assessing sufficiency.

          4              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Well, I mean,

          5    certainly companies tell us when they're

          6    going out of business, when there are changes

          7    in ownership, that sort of thing, especially

          8    on the census surveys.

         16    almost --

         17              DR. FEDER:  Randy, birth could also

         18    be a company that's not doing any energy-

         19    related activity or anything significant

         20    shifting to that sector.

         21              DR. SITTER:  Yes, but they don't

          4    births than one that's not, right?  So I

          5    think that they must have some indicators

          6    which at least would suggest the worst-case

          7    situations.  You already do, obviously,

          8    because at least heuristically you're making

          9    statements about some of these things like,

         10    oh, this wasn't unexpected and we would

         11    expect this to be a frame that isn't that

          7              DR. SITTER:  And most of you are

          8    knowledgeable about those.  I think that just

          9    the important thing the things you're worried

         10    about are the things that probably you're

         11    worrying about for a good reason and you

         12    should take advantage of that and not blindly

          4    something.  The Census Bureau had 350.  When

          5    we finally came down to things there were

          6    five that maybe they thought could have been

          7    on ours and our people thought that they

          8    shouldn't be and they were very small ones.

          9    But it took a lot of work to get down to that

         10    point.  So just looking at counts from the

         11    Census Bureau, they really have to get down

         12    and look at unit by unit to assess it.  It's

         13    a lot of work.

          6    was working the violent crimes desk out of

          7    the Forrestal Precinct.  My associates were

          8    members of the ASA Committee.  My name is

          9    French.  We were supposed to investigate an

         10    assault this afternoon but this time instead

         11    of trying to figure out who did it or

         12    capturing the perpetrator we're actually

         13    going to try to aggravate the assault because

         14    in this case the victim deserves to be

          1    look at what we intend to be a rather

          2    comprehensive attack on a problem that has

          3    been developing over time.  Certainly this is

          4    not something unique to our household survey.

          5    It's happening in household surveys across

          6    the federal government and certainly in the

          7    private sector as well.

          8              The Residential Energy Consumption

          9    Survey, to give you an idea for those of you

         10    who may be new to the committee, is one of

         11    EIA's set of end use consumption surveys,

         12    that is, surveys of the demand side of the

         13    energy equation, surveys of consumers of

         14    energy directly.

         15              And we do our household energy

         16    consumption survey as with the others with

         17    the intention of gathering characteristics of

         18    the population of energy consuming units

         19    under study and marrying that to information

         20    about their energy consumption and

         21    expenditures so that you'll have a basis for

          2    energy.

          3              And the RECS is our household part

          4    of that set of surveys.  It goes out to what

          5    will be in our next survey, which is going to

          6    be conducted beginning in August of this

          7    year, this time a set of 4,000 households,

          8    nationwide.  Our sample design, as always,

          9    will be a multi-stage area probability sample

         10    survey and after we do the characteristics

         11    collection we ask the respondents to the

         12    household interview to sign a waiver allowing

         13    us to go to their energy suppliers and gather

         14    the consumption and expenditures information.

         17              Well, we do have, as with other

         18    household surveys, a problem with nonresponse

         19    and since we have two surveys as part of the

         20    RECS system, the household survey and the

         21    supplier survey, we can get nonresponse in

         22    RECS when the household interview cannot be

          3    decides they don't want to sign the waiver to

          4    allow us to go to the energy supplier or if

          5    we get all of that the energy supplier we may

          6    not get the consumption and expenditure data

          7    from them for whatever reasons and we'll get

          8    into that in a few minutes.

          9              You will notice over time that the

         10    household interview response rate has been

         11    drifting down slowly over the past 20-plus

         12    years.  They drop at the very end from 78 and

         13    1/2 to 72.8, looks a little bit more

         14    concerning but I will tell you that there was

         15    a cost problem with the 2001 RECS.

         16              And part of the way that the cost

         17    problem was addressed was that the contractor

         18    did not make what we would consider to be an

         19    equivalent attempt to get the last few

         20    percentage points of response that one might

         21    have done in our previous surveys and so I

          1    equivalent effort you probably would have

          2    ended up with 75 or 76 percent response,

          3    perhaps, rather than 73 but that still

          4    continues the slow, slow drift of response

          5    rates.

          6              And along with that we had a

          7    corresponding uptick in nonsigning of

          8    authorization forms.  I tried to put a

          9    different background on this so it would show

         10    up a little bit better but we've got the

         11    white background here.  These are for

         12    different fuels.  You can't see a couple of

         13    the lines but it's fair enough to say all of

         14    them really track along each other together.

         15    Again, there is a greater uptick in non-

         16    signing rates for the authorization form in

         17    the last survey in 2001 but, again, probably

         18    due to a lack of conversion effort and so

         19    chances are it shouldn't have looked quite as

         20    bad as that under comparable effort but

         21    that's what we have.

         22              Similarly if you look at the

          1    percent of personal interview nonresponse,

          2    that is, refusals and unable to contact, you

          3    will notice that the trend is the same but

          4    we're having proportionately a greater

          5    acceleration in the rate of unable to

          6    contact.  And again we're all aware of that,

          7    the fact that people are out of their houses

          8    more, they're more difficult to reach, and so

          9    forth.

         10              And so when you put it all together

         11    at the various stages we have to use and we

         12    do use regression as an imputation technique

         13    to impute for consumption and expenditures

         14    when we don't actually get the consumption

         15    and expenditures.  And I'm emphasizing

         16    consumption and expenditures here because we

         17    consider that to be the core collection in

         18    our survey.  The characteristics go along but

         19    the consumption and expenditures are really

         20    the core of the survey.

         21              Well, obviously nonresponse at any

         22    stage of this effort affects the quality of

          1    the complete product so what do we want to

          2    do?  Well, let's start with the recruitment

          3    process.  As I said, we're considering a

          4    number of initiatives here.

          5              We're starting out with a plan for

          6    a supplemental contact even before we send

          7    the letters out to the household.  We're just

          8    going to send an introductory postcard out

          9    warning people that information is coming and

         10    that you are going to be part of a household

         11    survey.

         12              After that as a result of

         13    suggestions from our esteemed new office

         14    director Margot sitting over there said these

         15    letters really seem bureaucratic.  She wanted

         16    something more uplifting and upbeat.  Well,

         17    we're probably not going to be quite as

         18    spiritually oriented as the seminar I was

         19    just at over the lunch hour by a fellow who

         20    is plumping solar photovoltaics but hopefully

         21    our letters will be more upbeat and

         22    encouraging and eliminate bureaucratic

          3    federal government that was run under CIPSEA

          5    in bringing identifiable data in-house to

          6    work on which we had never done before.

          7              Well, what are we going to do about

          8    providing incentives to complete the

          9    household interview and sign the waiver form?

         10    Well, we're going to have information about

         11    RECS.  We're going to have brochures on

         12    energy saving methods.  Stephanie Battles,

         13    our RECS survey manager, is working on

         14    collecting those types of things from the

         15    Office of Energy Efficiency upstairs and

         16    wherever else she might be able to get them.

         17              Also when we ask people to sign the

         18    waiver form we will have a pen to hand them

         19    and they will be allowed to keep the pen when

         20    they've signed the waiver form.  And on top

         21    of that we are proposing in the packages at

         22    OMB right now for their consideration a

          1    monetary incentive for this survey.  As you

          2    know, OMB's record on approving monetary

          3    incentives and their attitude toward monetary

          4    incentives has been mixed, to say the least.

          5    There were times when they felt that it was

          6    an 1nappropriate thing to do but they

          7    realized the realities of the circumstances

          8    in which we work.  They are certainly willing

          9    to consider it.  We do have a proposal in for

         10    that for the current survey and we have not

         11    gotten any indications from OMB to this point

         12    that they are unfavorably disposed toward it

         13    so we think that it may be quite likely that

         14    they would approve it.

         15              We are proposing the monetary

         16    incentive as an experiment.  It will be

         17    unconditional.  It will be given out when we

         18    contact the household and set up the

         19    interview.  One third of the households will

         20    receive nothing, one third will receive $5,

         21    and one third will receive $10.

         22              Just FYI, the interview is expected

          1    average about 45 minutes in length.  And so

          2    these are the incentive levels that we've

          3    tried.  We will be giving cash, as I

          4    understand it.  We're not going to be giving

          5    phone cards or anything like that.  And the

          6    classes in which we will implement the

          7    experiment will be at the segment level.

          8              I said earlier that our survey is,

          9    like other household surveys, done by

         10    personal interview, a multistage survey.  At

         11    the segment level we will have maybe three or

         12    four households on average per respondents

         13    per segment and we will be doing the levels

         14    of incentive per segment.  So we avoid the

         15    neighbor effect where John says hey, I was

         16    interviewed by these people.  They gave me

         17    $10 to complete the interview, and Fred down

         18    the street says well, I was interviewed too

         19    but I didn't get anything, and that doesn't

         20    look too good.  So we will be doing this

         21    segment by segment.

          1    we are developing a new design for this

          2    household interview survey.  It's going to be

          3    used for the next several RECS but it's

          4    developed using post-2000 census information

          5    to upgrade our survey to represent the

          6    current population mix and distribution in

          7    the United States.

          8              We know from the development of

          9    this design that in certain areas it is

         10    likely that Spanish-speaking households will

         11    pose a significant problem.  There will be a

         12    number of places where a lot of the

         13    households will be limited or perhaps no

         14    knowledge of English among the adults who are

         15    eligible to complete the survey form.

         16              Well, you can always try to fudge

         17    your way around the problem by asking the

         18    teenage children if there are any to

         19    translate or do some other types of things.

         20    In the past we have done a Spanish

         21    translation and the interviewer has fumbled

         22    around with the paper translation.  This time

          1    and we operate our survey, by the way, using

          2    CAPI, using a Blaise questionnaire and

          3    control system, we are going to have the

          4    survey translated into Spanish on the CAPI

          5    system.  So the interviewer will be bilingual

          6    in these areas.  Our survey contractor,

          7    National Opinion Research Center is going to

          8    be hiring bilingual interviewers in those

          9    areas.  All they have to do is hit the

         10    Spanish version, up it comes, and they run on

         11    and it'll be entered into Blaise just the

         12    same way as anything else so we don't have to

         13    worry about supplemental coding or keying or

         14    anything like that.  Everything, of course,

         15    goes from the Blaise system directly into a

         16    central data processing and away we go.

         17    You'd like to do this with Korean and

         18    Japanese and some other languages too but

         19    they're really not frequently occurring

         20    enough to cost-effectively justify the

         21    procedure at this point.

          2    sometimes refuse.  And we know from past

          3    experience that there are sets of reasons why

          4    people don't go along with the survey.  One,

          5    of course, is security and confidentiality

          6    concerns, another is lack of time, another is

          7    uncertainty about whether the survey is

          8    really needed or what the data are used for.

          9    And then there are other people who just

         10    generally try to put you off.

         11              Because we have something close to

         18    understand from the interviewer the major

         19    concern was by the people who refused.

         20              We have not committed to implement

         21    this yet but we are considering that for

          2    shotgun, that we may sub-sample nonresponse

          3    if we find our initial response to be low

          4    enough that we want to focus our efforts and

          5    concentrate on a smaller number of people

          6    with more intensive follow-up.

          7              And what, obviously, we're going to

          8    be doing is for the committee to talk about

          9    whether these methods are appropriate, what

         10    additional methods, and what supplements you

         11    might suggest to what we're providing here.

         12    But one other thing I'd like a comment on

         13    from the committee is the idea that if you

         14    sub-sample nonresponse you then weight the

         15    respondent's double for purposes of counting

         16    your nonresponse rate in the end.  If the

         17    committee has anything to say about that I'd

         18    be glad to hear about it.

         20    which is missing energy supplier data.  This

         21    is a separate problem.  There are several

         22    causes.  One, of course, is you can't get

          1    there because the household respondent

          2    refuses to sign a waiver allowing you to get

          3    the information.  Sometimes the supplier is

          4    inaccessible and this is especially true in

          5    the case of fuel oil and LPG people.

          6              Sometimes you mess up the account

          7    number.  Somebody switches digits or

          8    something on you or for some reason the

          9    supplier says this isn't any account that I

         10    recognize or it isn't the account for the

         11    person you've got here or whatever.

         12              And then, of course, there is the

         13    problem of master metering in apartment

         14    buildings where you have nothing that

         15    corresponds to the unit that you actually

         16    selected for the survey which is an

         17    individual housing unit.

         18              What we're going to do in this case

         19    is arm the interviewers with electronic

         20    scanners.  And we are going to ask the

         21    respondents ahead of time to have their

         22    latest energy bills handy and the

          1    interviewers are going to scan a copy of

          2    those bills in and the idea is if you can do

          3    this you can get the supplier names and the

          4    account numbers correct.  And if any of you

          5    have looked at your energy bills sometimes

          6    your electric or natural gas bill will

          7    actually have a year's worth of consumption

          8    on it so even if something goes wrong later

          9    on down the line and we don't connect with

         10    the supplier somehow we still have a year's

         11    worth of consumption information.

         12              Bills ordinarily don't have

         13    expenditure information on but they do have

         14    the consumption information.  And if we have

         15    the consumption information we're really more

         16    than halfway home with regard to C and E and

         17    we can do a good job of imputing expenditures

         18    from consumption if we have it.  So you can

         19    even think of this as a partial effort to get

         20    part of our consumption data from the

         21    household respondent rather than from the

         22    supplier.

          7    there and see if they can get information at

          8    the building level, not the housing unit or

          9    the household level, in that rental agent

         10    survey.

         11              Once again we get supplier and

         12    account information identified clearly and if

         13    there is consumption information on the bill

         14    either that or if we can get to the supplier

         15    with that account information and have the

         16    agreement of the rental agent to get it we

         17    can then get the appropriate information and

         18    prorate that energy use for the sample

         19    household.  That is the operation that we

         20    ordinarily go through when we have a master-

         21    metered situation because obviously you're

         22    never going to get the energy consumption

          5    to do something about it.  And what we're

          6    asking the committee at this point is you've

          7    seen all of the major things that we're

          8    planning on doing to try to address non-

          9    response.  Do you have any improvements?  Do

         10    you have any changes?  Do you have any

         11    additional procedures at this point you'd

         12    like to suggest?  That's what we're looking

         13    for.  And if you'd like to comment about the

         14    formula for estimating nonresponse based on

         15    sub-sampling of nonrespondents I'd be glad to

         16    hear about that too.

          3    question.  First of all there are monetary

          4    concerns, budget concerns.  There always are.

          5    I suppose an alternative could be 0, 10, and

          6    20.

          7              DR. SITTER:  An alternative could

          8    be anything.  The question is what was the

          9    rationalization for the choices made?

         10              MS. SEREIKA:  How long is the

         14              MS. SEREIKA:  It's a 45-minute

         15    survey.

         16              MR. FRENCH:  We considered those

         17    amounts to be reasonable amounts, at least

         18    the upper one, the $10, a reasonable amount

         19    to compensate people for their effort in

         20    this.  I mean, you could say you ought to pay

          3    mind?

          4              MR. FRENCH:  Well, we've studied

          5    the literature a little bit and, of course,

          6    incentives are all over the board.  There are

          7    two competing things.  Number one is the

          8    economic incentive but number two, especially

          9    with a government survey, is you don't want

         10    to give them too much because there is a

         11    backlash effect where sometimes people will

         12    say what's the government spending all of

         13    this money, giving me money to do a survey,

         14    for?  And so you have to balance between --

         16    Let me tell you where I'm coming from.

         18    technical answer, as far as I know, Steph,

         19    this is a fair statement.  I mean, we have

         20    talked about this but there is no technical

         21    study that was done before the fact to

         22    determine those amounts.

          1              MS. BATTLES:  No, other than in the

          2    early '80s actually we did have an incentive

          3    at that time and it was like $2.  And at that

          4    time they did some studies and they didn't

          5    find too much of a difference in response

          6    rates.  The big thing was they did find

          7    statistically significant differences in

          8    signing of the authorization form which

          9    actually is the heart and soul of the other

         10    RECS itself.  And I think basically, though,

         11    we looked at the budget consideration of how

         12    much money we had.

         13              DR. SITTER:  Well, for example,

         14    there are some industries that it's almost

         15    impossible to determine what its value is to

         16    society.  Try to put the economic value on

         17    recreational activities, for example, and

         18    I've seen work on things like how do you

         19    compare the commercial fisheries versus the

         20    sports fisheries, which is worth more

         21    economically.

          1    interview people.  I've seen one where they

          2    interview a person coming in and they say

          3    well, if I'd have given you $50 would you

          4    have not gone fishing today, so this question

          5    costs you nothing but it addresses the

          6    question whether you're wasting your time

          7    using 5 or $10 or whether you could have got

          8    away with $5 or whether you should do fewer

          9    of them and give them $20.

         10              I don't know.  I'm just saying that

         11    what they discovered, of course, is that they

         12    didn't do any pre-work on the study I looked

         13    at and they blew it.  They wasted half of

         14    their time using too small a dollar value.  I

         15    guess they didn't know much about fishermen

         16    but not many fishermen are going to stay home

         17    if you offer them five bucks.  They didn't

         18    say I'll give you five bucks, would you have

         19    stayed home, so they get a lot of zeroes.  So

         20    they learn nothing, right?  Zeroes don't give

         21    you any information.

          1    they're putting a value on their free time so

          2    that you can do a better estimate of how much

          3    money to offer them?

          4              DR. SITTER:  Right, so then you do

          5    a simple logistic regression.  You can get an

          6    estimate of how much you could have increased

          7    your thing if you had in fact offered the

          8    dollar value.  So the reason I bring this up

          9    is because, I mean, you could get turned

         10    down, for example.

         11              You're not allowed to offer

         12    monetary incentives but you'd be allowed to

         13    ask that question and if you were to ask that

         14    question with different dose levels, that is,

         15    different dollar values across your survey

         16    randomly, then perhaps you can use that to

         17    make a better case for them to actually give

         18    you the money.  That is, if you tried 0, 5,

         19    10, 15, 20, just as a question then you fit a

         20    logistic regression to it and you can get an

         21    estimate of if we would have offered $10 to

          9    the related things.  He said security, lack

         10    of time, uncertainty about the need.

         11              MR. FRENCH:  Uncertainty about the

         12    need for the data and then just a general

         13    put-off type of refusal, I don't really want

         14    to do it or something like that where you

         15    can't pin a reason down.

         17    compensation will only address only one

         18    portion of those people really.  I think the

         19    way I look at it is it will be nice if we can

         20    connect the monetary value to the need for

         21    the data.  For example, you say this is how

         22    much worth it is if you are spending all this

          3    indirectly tell them.

          4              MR. FRENCH:  Well, actually in a

          5    sense we're not because what we do not want

          6    with the incentive is to indicate to the

          7    people that it is payment for their response.

          8    The government really is not in the business

          9    of paying people to give out information.

         10    And what we are going to indicate to the

         11    respondents is that the incentive would be a

         12    token of thanks for completing the survey but

         13    not payment for completing the survey.

         14              And one could say well, gee, that's

         15    a fine line but in fact in the government

         16    sometimes treading fine lines is an important

         17    thing to do indicating that thank you for

         18    responding and here's the money.  Now,

         19    understand, this incentive is going to be

         20    paid out at the beginning of the process, not

         21    at the end of the process.  This is an

         15              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Right, and then

         16    the thought is if you're telling them you

         17    might give them a cash incentive maybe

         18    they'll be willing to come to the door.

         20    money, maybe.

          1              MS. ANDERSON:  I wanted to follow

          2    up on this issue that Randy raised about can

          3    you turn part of this into an experiment.

          4    We're clearly going to look at the folks that

          5    don't get an incentive.  We're breaking it up

          6    into three groups, nothing, 5, and 10 bucks.

          7              Could you put such a question on

          8    the survey that even if you don't get the

          9    money you could ask a question would you have

         10    been more willing or can we try and get at

         11    some of this information to do the continued

         12    evaluation even if OMB gives you permission

         13    to do this?

         14              In other words how can you get

         15    additional information about how much we need

         16    to pay to get people to be more interested in

         17    this?  How could we do it even if we get the

         18    permission from the OMB to give the

         19    incentive?

         20              DR. SITTER:  Well, first of all

         21    these are in-person interviews so I wouldn't

          1    people that refuse.

          2              MS. ANDERSON:  Right, and then you

          3    would say well, if we'd given you 10 bucks

          4    would you have let me in the door?

          5              DR. SITTER:  See, you can choose

          6    different dose levels too.  For some you'd

          7    say 10, some you say 20, some you say 30.

          8    And it's just a zero/one response.  Now you

          9    have a dose response curve.  You can fit a

         10    model to it.

         11              MS. ANDERSON:  You might be able to

         12    use that for the next round and whether

         13    you're picking the right amount.

         14              MS. SEREIKA:  So you're saying you

         15    actually will have it so there are forced

         16    choices?  They don't come up with a number in

         17    their head?

         18              DR. SITTER:  No, no, you choose the

         19    dose.  You don't say to them how much it

         20    would have cost me for your response.

         21              MS. SEREIKA:  You choose the dose.

          2              MS. ANDERSON:  You might have a

          3    little experiment going that would tell you

          4    something about what people might be willing

          5    to pay for this nonrespondent and presumably

          6    if you get to that point OMB has already

          7    agreed to give out something.  Now you have

          8    additional information to try and zero in on

          9    how much that ought to be in subsequent

         10    surveys.

         13    still do this.

         17              DR. SITTER:  So let's do a

         18    scenario.  Suppose you have 10 percent of

         19    your survey people don't respond and then you

         20    do this for all of them.  What you end up

         21    with is some curve.  And with that curve you

         22    can estimate if we had have offered all the

          1    nonrespondents 20 bucks then a third of them

          2    would have responded.  So now you say well,

          3    of course, I couldn't have identified the

          4    nonrespondents so I would have had to give 20

          5    bucks to everybody or —————— so if you can

          6    get at least some notion of what the cost

          7    would be to you, what five bucks would have

          8    bought you, what ten bucks would have bought

          9    you, what twenty bucks would have bought you,

         10    and it may be that the answer is don't even

         11    waste their money.  It might not be the

         12    thing.  In other words a lot of what you gain

         13    from all your other activities will be much

         14    higher than the monetary incentives.

         16    matters.  This is a really tiny point but the

         17    data show that incentive amounts required are

         18    much higher to convert refusals than they are

         19    if you start off here's $10.00, now here's

         20    what I would like from you.  And so if you're

          4    want to worry about that same kind of --

          5              DR. SITTER:  Yes, so some thought

          6    about how you might get --

         10    tricky.

         11              MS. FORSYTH:  Because you don't

         13    really costs you.

         15    giving monetary incentives to people who

         16    initially refuse is then you can hardly avoid

         17    the perception that you are paying them to

         18    respond.

         19              DR. SITTER:  So getting at that

         20    point might be tricky.  You'd have to give

         21    that some really serious thought.

          2    give them.

          3              MS. KIRKENDALL:  The other thing is

          4    that the Census Bureau did some experiments

          5    on the conversion of refusals and they paid

          6    like 50 bucks or something.  This was for one

          7    of those that have had a deterioration on the

          8    response rate to a point where it was getting

          9    so that the results just weren't valid any

         10    more.  And so they really needed to build

         11    back that response.  And one concern was if

         12    you only give it to nonrespondents and people

         13    know each other then they'll I told them no

         14    and I got 50 bucks versus the guy next door

         15    who was nice and went along with them didn't

         16    get anything.

         17              DR. SITTER:  But I think the point

         18    here was in the terms of the study itself.

         19              MS. FORSYTH:  How you ask the

         20    questions.

          1    and they are more difficult they are going to

          2    cost you more.  So the numbers you get might

          3    suggest that it will cost you 20 bucks when

          4    really it wouldn't have cost you so much.  If

          5    you take the same person and offered the

          7    you five but conditional upon them already

          9    They said no, you say well, I'll give you

         10    five bucks, they say no, I already said no.

         11    You can't buy my vote.  But if you said well,

         13    maybe they would have said okay.

         16    actually use the data to calibrate what the

         17    people in the no-incentive condition are

         18    telling you about the incentive that would be

         19    required.  So it's actually better if you do

          5    Stephanie mentioned, what we had paid in the

          6    past and if you inflate that by inflation

          7    between now and then the levels are probably

          8    roughly comparable.  We also looked at other

          9    studies and, of course, there are surveys out

         10    in the field now that pay a lot more than

         11    that but they ask a lot more of people also.

         12              Then you got surveys that, well,

          7    can offer a lower incentive for a higher

          8    level of participation.  We're doing it by

          9    segment.  Also we are trying to stratify by

         10    income.  This is the first time we have tried

         11    this.  Actually I have received some positive

         12    information back from OMB as far as the

         13    acceptance of this and they did also question

          5    believe there's a difference in the impact on

          6    different income groups then are you now not

          7    going to implicitly create a problem in terms

          8    of your nonresponse adjustments or are you

          9    going to stratify those as well?  Because you

         10    know what I mean?  You probably have to take

         11    that into account.  If you're going to

         12    stratify your incentives you have to keep in

         13    mind that you don't want your nonresponse to

         20    have a zero impact on me.  Your 5 bucks is

         11    were the reasons for it.  I mean, we think of

         11    time these guys knocked on their door.

         14    hot whether that has any impact on response

         15    rates.  There are probably a few surveys that

         17    how those might affect response rates.  But

         18    we might be able to get some extra bang from

         19    the fact that energy prices have been so much

         20    in the news and people are concerned, not

         21    alarmed but certainly concerned about it.

          9              DR. SITTER:  One thing maybe, is

         10    the soft nonresponse sub-sampling probably

         11    should be done within your income strata, I

         12    think.  Your analysis is going to be based on

         13    probably some two-phase sampling strategy,

         14    that is, that the nonresponse is random.

         15    Probability of nonresponse is constant within

         16    sub-sampling, right, so you should probably

         17    do your sub-sampling within those classes.

         18    Your estimation will be —————— and you'd just

          6    thing I have heard people say as a way to get

          7    people to pay more attention when you mail

          8    them something.

          9              DR. SITTER:  Unfortunately this is

         10    being grossly overused by the advertising

         11    industry making things look like a check,

         12    making things look like it's important,

         13    making things look like it's confidential,

         14    and now we're getting pretty adept at

         17    thing.  That's my opinion.

         18              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Well, no, the

         19    Census with or some agency had a couple of

         20    percent change in response rate simply by

         15    in addition to that we do one other thing,

         16    which is an interesting thing that we stopped

         18    it, and have continued to do it since then

         19    and that is we actually train the

         20    interviewers to measure the square footage of

         21    the housing unit.  We don't ask people what

          2    idea.

          3              MR. FRENCH:  People like me even

          4    know, people like most people don't know, and

          5    so we actually go out with measuring

          6    equipment and do that.

          7              MS. KIRKENDALL:  Does your

          8    interviewer check out the furnace and make

          9    sure that it is what they say it is?

         10              MR. FRENCH:  No, they do not.

         14    and look at the furnace.

         15              MR. FRENCH:  Well, actually it's an

         16    interesting question because you don't nose

         17    around people's houses.  I mean, it's bad

         18    enough to even ask them.  If you are going to

         19    try to measure the unit from the inside

         20    because let's say it's an inside apartment

         21    and how are you going to measure the building

         22    to get the apartment?  It's bad enough to

          1    even ask people to do that.  We usually try

          2    to measure from outside whenever we can

          3    especially when it's a house.

          4              MS. SEREIKA:  Then that ——————

          6    something if it's a multi-unit dwelling

          7    measure the outside and then try that --

          8              MR. FRENCH:  Yes, or sometimes even

          9    from the rental agent survey the rental agent

         10    may be able to tell you that's an 800 square

         11    foot apartment because they know.  They rent

         12    the thing.

         13              MS. SEREIKA:  In Pittsburgh they

         14    have assessment information and they have the

         15    size of houses listed.  I mean, there is a

         16    lot of information on the web, I'm pretty

         17    sure.  I wonder if that's also the case that

         18    you can get information on size that way.

         19              MR. FRENCH:  I think we have gotten

         20    some in the past, haven't we, Stephanie?

          2    you don't get if they have added on to their

          3    issues?

          4              MR. FRENCH:  They go through what,

          5    four days of training?  A lot of that is

          6    going through the questionnaire and asking

          7    the questions.  Are they energy experts?  No.

          8    Some of them may be on their own, not experts

          9    but at least reasonably knowledgeable about

         10    energy.

         15    help?

         16              MR. FRENCH:  Potentially they could

         17    help but they are not really trained to do

         18    that and they are supposed to go through the

          3    you may not get the right person to answer

          4    the questionnaire and that's true in some

          5    logistic sense because the right person may

          6    not be home at the right time when the

          7    interviewer knocks on the door but they can

          8    get an interview and if they can get an

          9    interview with somebody who seems reasonably

         10    competent they will do that.

         11              But by the same token you may have

         12    a better chance of interesting somebody who

         13    has more of an interest in energy.  So there

         14    may be a slight tendency to get an interview

         15    with the person who is more interested in

         16    energy simply because they are more likely to

         17    respond or if the person who doesn't know

         18    anything said you really ought to talk to my

         19    spouse because they are the one who knows

         20    about all this stuff and come back later and

         21    check with them.  So they don't refuse but

         22    they don't really go ahead either and then

          8    mean, I am not going to take this four-year

         10    that the person uses in the household we

         11    would like to get the most recent energy bill

         20    one monthly bill or a whole year's worth of

          5              And some utilities are doing that

          7    what's going on with their household and how

         12    the average temperature this year and last

          7              MR. FRENCH:  See, the idea of the

          9    additional 2 percent on your response rate

         10    based on let's say a one half sub-sample of

         11    the soft nonrespondents that counts towards 4

         12    percent additional nonresponse because you

         13    sub-sampled half the nonrespondents and each

          5    percent that they sampled and they translated

          6    that into an overall 90-something percent

          7    response rate which many people thought was a

          8    little misleading.

          9              Well, you're following the rule

         10    ———————— what Dwight just said.  It sounds

         11    better if it's only 1 or 2 percent that you

         12    get.

         13              DR. SITTER:  No, that's just wrong.

         14              MS KIRKENDALL:  How would you

         15    compute it?

         16              DR. SITTER:  Well, a response rate

         17    is a response rate.  What you're doing the

         18    sub-sampling for usually is to determine

         19    whether there is a difference between

         20    respondents and nonrespondents so that you

         21    can then assume that there is no difference

         22    in estimating.

          4    have been criticized.

          5              MS. ANDERSON:  They were criticized

          6    but I'm not sure I ever saw what they were

          7    supposed to do with the numbers.  So you

          8    would not use those sub-sampled ones?

          9              MR. FRENCH:  In other words if they

         10    got 70 percent nonresponse in the first wave

         11    the way you get to 97 percent response is you

         12    sample 10 percent out of the 30 percent that

         13    you haven't got a response from.  Out of

         14    those 10 percent you get 9 percent of them to

         15    respond which inflates to 27 percent when you

         16    triple it and you add that to the 70 percent

         17    and you get 97 percent.

         19    but it's really misleading.

          5    compute all these --

          6              DR. SITTER:  Is first of all you do

          7    the sub-sample of nonrespondents and what

          8    you're really interested in is are the

          9    characteristics of your nonrespondents

         10    basically the same on the things you are

         11    interested in as your respondents.  Let's

         12    suppose that it's true.  Well, now, if you

         13    had an original 70 percent and you got 9 of

         14    your 10 or 90 percent response in your

         15    follow-ups you have 79 percent response rate

         16    and because the characteristics are the same

         17    for both then you can join them together

         18    reasonably so, okay.

         19              You can also now estimate the total

         20    by operating with the nonresponse adjustment

         21    with more confidence because the nonrespond

         22    adjustments assumes that the probability of

          1    nonresponse was at random and it wasn't

          2    related to your characteristics.  So it's

          3    two-fold but you still only got 79 percent

          4    response rate.

          5              MS. FORSYTH:  They get differential

          6    weighting in the analysis and in the

          7    estimation but you don't differentially rate

          8    them in computing the response rate where

         20    your respondents and weight them up by a 100

          8    something more complicated because --

         10    the nonresponse cases that you were able to

         11    convert up to represent all of the non-

         18    multi-stage area probability survey from

         19    4,000 households to collect information on

          4    relate them to one another.  But what they

          5    have had since probably at least 1980 because

          6    that's the data they showed us they've shown

          7    a steady declining rate of response from

          8    these respondents.

          9              For example, in 1980 they had a

         10    response rate of 87.5 and in 2001 it declined

         11    to 72.8.  And they did note that in that year

         12    there was also a cost problem when they were

         13    trying to conduct the surveys which could

         14    have led to them having a lower response rate

         19              And the other thing they've noticed

         20    is that there has also been an increase in

         21    the authorization form not being signed, also

          7    suggesting a number of different initiatives.

          8    First off they wanted to start with the

          9    household interviewer in how they recruit

         10    people.  They thought before actually sending

         11    out introductory letters they would first

         12    start out with an introductory postcard

         13    basically foretelling of the survey to come.

         14    They also were suggesting the idea that the

         15    introductory letters that each of the

         16    respondents receive be reworked so that

         17    they're more upbeat, eliminate bureaucratic

         18    recitation of required information, the idea

         19    of a gift, and, probably more importantly,

         20    the idea of that they would protect

         21    information and confidentiality of the

         22    respondent.

          9    they use the approach they're proposing to

         10    do, and that is you're actually conducting an

         15    actually is one of the things later

         16    discussed.  Why did we choose those dollar

         17    amounts?  And there appears to be some

         18    evidence in the literature to support the

         19    choice of the dollar amount although there

         20    were still some concerns about that choice.

         21              The survey, just so you know, is

         22    about a 45-minute survey so, again, it should

          2    amount.  In terms of how the randomization

          3    will occur they are going to actually give

          4    the incentives based on a segment level so

          5    that neighbors would be receiving the same

          6    amount rather than it possibly differing

          7    within a segment.

          8              The other initiative they have

          9    underway is the fact that there may be more

         10    difficulty actually interviewing Spanish-

         11    speaking households and the idea being that

         12    they would identify areas where that was a

         13    very heavily Spanish-speaking region.  They

         14    would also use bilingual interviewers to get

         15    the information from the subject in an effort

         16    to get more accurate information and also to

         17    be able to conduct the survey.

         18              Reasons why some nonresponse is

         19    still probably going to occur include again

         20    the security and the confidentiality of

         21    information.  The respondent may feel there

         22    is a lack of time that they have in order to

          2    greatly appreciate the need of the

          3    information, what it's going to be used for.

          4              There is a thought of using

          5    customized letters to address the concerns,

          6    and also the idea of sub-sampling the soft

          7    nonresponse.  What else?  Also there are some

          8    thoughts to equip the interviewers with

          9    scanners to collect information.  So when

         10    they're working with the respondent and the

         11    respondent gives them hopefully their most

         12    recent energy statements for the varieties of

         13    energy they're using this information could

         14    be scanned off the bill from this respondent.

         16    information of the back of the card regarding

         17    the consumption over the past year.

         18              When it comes to the apartment

         19    buildings which are master-metered the idea

         20    is that the interviewer will try to again get

         21    building-level energy consumption information

         22    from the rent agent and then also estimate

          5              The question that had been put

          8    might suggest.  In response to that there was

          9    further discussion about the choice of the

         10    monetary incentives.  One of reasons why the

         11    choices were made besides having some

         12    information ———————— to support the choice

          5    mind is incentives are always to be viewed as

          9    else.

         10              There is also a thought, given the

         11    changes occurring right now in terms of

         12    increasing energy cost, there is a hope that

         13    respondents may become more responsive and

         14    actually be more willing to complete the

         15    survey.  There is a hope in that.

         18    improve response rate.  Being that it's more

         19    official looking, it may encourage people to

         20    actually be more willing to respond.  Toward

          9    contract for our consumption surveys and all

         10    four of them submitted bids and all four of

         11    them recommended in their bid submissions

         12    that we use that we use an incentive.

         13              Now, they didn't specify how much

         14    it ought to be but they all said for your own

          3    in the proposal but the way we judged the

          4    amounts to offer was based on literature,

          5    based on the amount of burden we were placing

          6    on people, which was an average of 45 minutes

          7    per response, for the most part nonintrusive

          8    questions or questions that people would feel

         11    surveys had offered for comparable types of

          3    things.  Yes, it's a very effective way of

          4    increasing response rates.  I have two issues

          5    with that.  Number one, I think it introduces

          6    a break in the series in the choice that we

          7    talked about before because it does have an

          8    effect on responses.  Number two, a $10

          9    incentive may mean a lot to one person and

         10    nothing to another person so it does

         11    introduce a bias and I think it's a good idea

         12    that you have this one-third, one-third,

         13    one-third split so you can do some analysis

         14    and see the effect of the incentive.

         15              MR. BERNSTEIN:  But I must say

         16    there is plenty of experience by survey

         17    research firms on that already.  I don't

         18    think you need to do that.

         12    are not the same as surveys done by private

          3    invasive.

          4              MR. BERNSTEIN:  No, that's not

          5    true, either.  I'm going to have to go back.

          6    I will go back and talk to our survey

          7    research group —————————————— but I know we

          8    have done surveys under federal government

          9    contracts.  They have cash incentives.

         10              DR. FEDER:  We do incentives on

         11    government surveys.

         12              MS. KIRKENDALL:  If you'd find the

         13    characteristics of them and actually the

         14    amounts would interesting to know too.  But

         15    OMB used to disapprove them routinely with

         16    any incentives and they've only loosened up

         17    fairly recently, within the last five years

         18    and for a while other than the health.

         19    They've done health incentives for a long

         20    time because of the nature of the survey.

         21              DR. FEDER:  Susan mentioned a

         22    question which is unanswered, why have the

          9    surveys, I think, but certainly government

         10    surveys.

         14    These are personal visits.

         17    been declining in all modes.

         19    telephone context, and I think you alluded to

         20    this in your presentation, most of that non-

          3    personal interview survey we have seen some

          4    uptick in that.  And that's a result of

          5    smaller household sizes which means there are

          6    fewer people in total possible to be home at

          7    any one particular time.  My wife and I are

         17    home.  Never mind try to convince them.

         18              MS. KHANNA:  I have just one side

         19    comment which is you asked your respondents

         20    to have their electricity bill.  That's a

         21    one-hour search for me.  It's not a 45-minute

         13    what I heard as we only had like 10 minutes

          7    a place outside.  The place actually opens at

          8    5:30 so you can look for me outside.

          9              DR. HENGARTNER:  The other thing I

         10    wanted to announce is tomorrow morning we

         11    start again fairly early.  Let me suggest

         12    that if those who stay at the hotel we could

         13    meet in the lobby around 7:30 and then we can

         14    go together, take the Metro, and there is

         15    going to be breakfast and coffee here.  So

         16    thank you very much for a very productive day

         17    and see you tomorrow morning.

         18                   (Whereupon, at 4:55 p.m., the

         19                   PROCEEDINGS were continued.)
