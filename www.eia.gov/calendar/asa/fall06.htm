<p>1.  <u><strong>The National Energy Modeling System:  The Next Steps Forward</strong></u>, Susan H. Holte, Technical
  Assistant to the Administrator</p>
<p>This presentation to the
  Committee provided a status report on EIA’s effort to upgrade and enhance the
  National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). While NEMS has been continuously updated
  and revised over its 15-year life to maintain relevancy, the time is right to
  step back, reconsider parts of the model, and request additional resources in
  support of the effort to upgrade and enhance the model.</p>
<p>At this time, an EIA team has
  been formed to lead the effort. The team has requested input on NEMS from
  stakeholders within the Department.  Several
  offices in the Department are very interested in the effort because they must
  use NEMS to illustrate the potential energy market and economic benefits of
  their programs as part of their budget submissions. Also, letters have been
  sent to various energy trade groups and research organizations, as well as to
  some of the National Laboratories with interest in energy modeling. The NEMS
  modelers and analysts in EIA’s Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting
  have also provided input on potential model enhancements that are likely out of
  the scope of typical annual updates.</p>
<p>Over the next several months,
  the team will synthesize the input and prioritize the potential model
  enhancements in support of future budget submissions and other planning
  activities.</p>
<p>EIA’s activities and approach
  mentioned in M’s Holt’s presentation led to questions and discussion but not
  advice.  The purpose of this session was
  to inform the Committee.</p>
<p>2.  <u><strong>Needs and Priorities for Consumption
  Information in the Future</strong></u>,  sometimes called, “Back to the
  Future:  Learning from the Past About the
  Future of Energy Demand Data Collection”  Dwight French, EMEU, EIA</p>
<strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>
<p>The purpose of this
  presentation was to acquaint the Committee with the limitations of the energy
  consumption data program in EIA, and solicit the opinions of the Committee on
  the criteria that should be used to decide what if any additional programs or
  improvements to already-existing programs are worth pursuing in this area, and
  how the need for consumption data should be balanced against the need for data
  from elsewhere in EIA about other aspects of energy throughput.</p>
<p>The energy consumption area
  of EIA, rather than covering all energy use and breaking it down (the
  “accounting” approach used by supply information systems in EIA), covers
  individual sectors of U.S. society, and provides information about the
  characteristics of the consumers in each sector, as well as their energy
  consumption and expenditures.  The
  characteristics data are used to provide more detailed understanding of energy
  consumption.  However, some sectors are
  missing from consumption system coverage.  Also, not all energy sources are covered within covered sectors, and
  many characteristics of consumers in the various covered sectors are not
  collected.  There are good reasons for
  these omissions:  expense of providing
  more information; burden control; inability of respondents to provide many
  technical characteristics; inability to take advantage of some detailed
  information that might be collected; etc.  Many of these obstacles could be overcome and the consumption data
  program made more complete and responsive, but it would take people and dollars
  to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the questions for
  the Committee members at the session were:  what consumption area enhancements should be considered, especially
  keeping in mind that at most limited additional funds can be expected in the
  immediate future; and what criteria should EIA use in deciding how to allocated
  funds between EIA’s consumption data programs and other pressing EIA program
  needs?</p>
<p><strong> ASA Committee Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on the
  sectors of
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  society where changes are occurring most rapidly.</p><p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on
  directions that emerging energy policy seems to be pushing; for example, it
  might be wise to prepare to deal with emerging renewable energy forms, or
  prepare to measure emergence of alternative vehicle fuels.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on doing
  more detailed breakdowns of “other” energy use (the remainder after identified
  end uses have been quantified).  Especially for electricity, “other” uses are growing over time.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider doing
  mini-surveys between regular cycles of the surveys, to get basic information
  more often.  Or perhaps even go to
  something closer to “continuous measurement”, where a data on a subset of the
  sample is collected every year, equivalent to doing a big survey every 4 years,
  and data are produced every year, highly correlated from year to year, through
  a 4-year rolling average estimator.</p>
<p><strong> EIA
  Intended Response(s)</strong></p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; We try to focus
  on change in the various sectors, but it can be difficult because our surveys
  are conducted only every 4 years.  If we
  miss something new, it’s awhile until we have another chance to address it.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s fair to say
  that EIA will be keeping a careful eye on renewable energy forms and
  incorporating these into data collection.  We have a problem in the consumption area with emerging subject matter
  areas, because our relatively small sample sizes don’t allow us to address
  relatively rare events.  Also, consumers
  tend to be ignorant of emerging areas, so it can be difficult to get reliable
  data on new things.  It is interesting
  that the hot new emerging subject matter area at the moment is alternative
  fuels for highway transport – an area in which EIA does not currently collect
  data.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA has done some
  additional breakouts of electricity use for appliances over time, but it can be
  difficult to model the effects of a myriad of small, not-all-that-intensive
  appliances that consume a significant amount of energy because there are so
  many, and so many different ones.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA has thought
  about doing this with MECS.  The critical
  issue is timing an interim effort right, budget-wise, and maybe moving a
  regular survey back once to make a budget available for such a special
  effort.  MECS would be the easiest to do logisticly, and maybe could serve as a first initiative, with other consumption surveys
  following its lead at a later time.  The
  problem with taking such an approach for the consumption surveys is cost
  inefficiencies, though there could be some cost savings through amortized
  processing systems, use of already-trained interviewers, etc.</p>

<p class=Default><b><u>Abstract </u></b></p>
<p class=Default style='text-align:justify'>Refinery operations in the Unite
  States provide useful information on the supply of petroleum products. The EIA
  Form-810 provides a very comprehensive set of data on inputs, outputs, and
  changes in inventory of all refineries in the
  <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  In recent years, Form-810 data
  receives special attention by stake holders as it provides useful information
  on the trends in demand for major products and can have profound implications
  on prices of crude oil and major petroleum products. </p><p class=Default style='text-align:justify'>The goal of this paper is to review
  the refinery input and output data system that report the demand for petroleum
  products, to identify possible data inconsistencies, and to make adjustments if
  necessary to the time series demand data. Several simple regression models will
  be used to examine the relationship between refinery gain and production of
  major products. The statistical relationships developed in these models can be
  used to identify potential outliers and to help data analysts verify data
  accuracy with respondents. The end product will be a methodology and a computer
  program that EIA may use to detect outliers and improve data quality. </p>
  <p class=Default style='text-align:justify'>The Energy Information
    Administration (EIA) defines demand as product supplied, which measures the
    disappearance of products from primary sources, i.e., refineries, natural gas
    processing plants, blending plants, pipelines, and bulk terminals. In general,
    product supplied of each product in any given period is computed as: field
    production, plus refinery production, plus imports, plus unaccounted for crude
    oil, minus stock change, minus crude oil losses, minus refinery inputs, minus
    exports. Refinery production is the largest component of product supplied and
    gasoline dominates
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    refinery production, therefore, this paper will focus only on refinery
    operations of gasoline and its effects on refinery gain. Specifically, the
    focus of this paper includes inputs to refineries, production of gasoline, and
    refinery processing gain. Historically, refinery volumetric gain ranges from 4
    to 7 percent and is closely related to gasoline production. In 2005, refinery
    production averages about 17.7 million barrels per day and a one percent
    increase in refinery gain amounts to more than 170 thousands per day additional
    production or about 62 million barrels per year. </p><p class=Default>*This is a working document prepared by the Energy Information
  Administration (EIA) in order to solicit advice and comment on statistical
  matters from the American Statistical Association Committee on Energy
  Statistics. This topic will be discussed at EIA's fall 2006, meeting with the
  Committee to be held October 5 and 6, 2006. </p>
<p><strong> ASA Committee Recommendations and EIA Intended Response(s)</strong></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-collinearity: data series may be correlated in the refinery
  gain equation.&nbsp; We should correct that before worrying about
  autocorrelation.&nbsp; Response: we will re-run the refinery gain equation with
  gasoline production and crude oil input as independent variables.&nbsp; We will
  run covariance analysis for independent variable in the gasoline production
  equation. </p>

  Shore, from the audience, said the
  equation may have missed one variable.&nbsp; She indicated that the ACU cut
  point may vary with seasons and the model may need a variable to pick up
  seasonality.&nbsp; Response: we can insert seasonal or monthly dummy variables
  to capture the effects of seasonality on refinery operations. </p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; December tax
  treatment.&nbsp; Henry Brooks, from the audience, said that December production
  is higher than July and August because refiners want to push inventory out to avoid
  taxes on inventory.&nbsp; Response: if it is for tax purposes, refiners should
  also increase refinery inputs.&nbsp; Does tax treatment also affect the way
  refiners operate in a way that alters input and output relationship and
  technologies? </p>

<p>4.  <u><strong>Electricity 2008  Introduction:
  The Broad Plan</strong></u>, Robert Schnapp, Director, Electric Power Division, CNEAF,
  EIA    </p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong></p>
<p>EIA presented a summary of
  the current status of the “Electricity 2008” project.  This project was initiated by the Electric
  Power Division (EPD) to reassess the current electric power surveys, which have
  to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget every three years for
  approval.</p>
<p>The Committee was presented
  with the major issues that the EPD is addressing.  These include: 1) merging the Form EIA-906,
  “Power Plant Report,” the Form EIA-920, “Combined Heat and Power Plant Report,”
  and the Form EIA-423, “Monthly Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants
  Report;” 2) merging the Form EIA-860, “Annual Electric Generator Report,” and
  the static information from the Form EIA-767, “Steam-Electric Plant Operation and Design Report;”
  3) modifying the samples for these forms; and 4) revising the data
  confidentiality policy.</p>
<p><strong>ASA Committee Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this
  presentation was to inform the Committee on the status of the project.  Several questions were raised in the
  discussion period that followed.  These
  included: the reasons for limiting the sample, why the CHP fuel needed to split
  out, the choices for the cut-off samples, the future importance of the CHP
  sector, and non-response issues.  </p>
<p><strong> EIA
  Intended Response(s):</strong></p>
<p>These questions were
  addressed and there were no outstanding issues or suggestions to change the
  proposed course of the project.</p>
<p>5.  <u><strong>Electricity 2008  Forms Redesign Issues Resulting From
  Combining Electric Power Surveys</strong></u>, Bob Rutchik, SMG, EIA</p>
<p> <strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong> This presentation outlined issues that had arisen
  from merging five EIA electricity survey forms into two new surveys. EIA will
  merge three monthly surveys into one survey that will collect data both monthly
  and annually. These surveys are:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA-423, Monthly
  Cost and Quality of Fuels Electric Plants Report</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA-906, Power
  Plant Report, and </p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA-920, Combined Heat and Power Plant Report.</p>
<p>The second combination will
  merge two annual forms into one annual survey. They are: </p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA-860, Annual
  Electric Generator Report, and </p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parts of the
  EIA-767, Steam, Electric and Plant Operation and Design Report</p>
<p>The session was intended to
  ask the Committee’s advice on the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does EIA have the
  correct data requirements for the EIA-423, EIA-906, and EIA-920 combined form?</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should EIA
  be aware of in formulating an imputation methodology for monthly data for
  Combined Heat and Power Plants (CHPs) on the merged
  EIA-423/EIA-906/EIA-920? </p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does EIA have the
  correct data requirements for the combined EIA-860 and EIA-767?</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the
  committee think of the cut off sampling methodologies for both new surveys?</p>
<p><strong>ASA Committee Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>One of EIA’s data
  requirements on the combined monthly surveys is fuel cost. Mr. Burton advised
  EIA that EIA is going to run into situations where the respondents are going to
  have a hard time telling EIA what their fuel costs are and that EIA should be
  concerned bout the reliability of these data.</p>
<p>On imputing monthly data for CHPs, he advised EIA possibly to use different imputation
  methodologies for large and small facilities because of the possible difference
  in economics between the two.</p>
<p>Mr. Edmonds was also
  concerned about the differences between large and small facilities. By cutting
  back on the number of monthly respondents that EIA will sample, EIA will be
  sampling only large plants and not small ones. There are differences between
  the two in the way they operate. If EIA does not account for this difference,
  the quality of the data collected could be adversely affected.</p>
<p>Mr. Neerchal asked about just
  using covariates, like total sales, other than generation capacity for the
  sampling. He also brought up the subject of EIA asking the small plants in the
  combined EIA-860/EIA-767 which will be sampled once every three years to
  provide their data for the other two years. EIA and other Committee members
  voiced concern about recall and the quality of records. This, though, is
  something EIA could ask about during its forms testing period. </p>
<p><strong>EIA Intended Response(s):</strong></p>
<p>EIA will address these
  issues, the quality of cost data and the differences between large and small
  facilities in both combined surveys when it tests the forms with respondents. </p>
<p>6.  <strong><u>Emerging
  Technologies, Data, and NEM Modeling</u></strong><b>, </b>Chris Namovicz, OIAF, EIA</p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong></p>
<p>EIA provided an overview of
  the wind energy model used in NEMS.  Focus was given on the challenges involved in collecting data in a
  market that is relatively new.  Although
  some data and approaches are becoming available, identifying the resource
  limitations is difficult, since such a small fraction of the potential resource
  base has been exploited.</p>
<p><strong>ASA Committee Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>The Committee respondents
  recommended several lines of potential data for some issues, such as community
  reaction and growth limits.  Using data
  collected for other locally undesirable land uses (such as prisons) may help provide
  a gauge on the potential cost of “NIMBY” issues in the wind industry.  Some international markets are experience
  similar wind industry growth as the
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
,
  and may provide insights into issues within the
<st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  market. </p>
<p><strong>EIA
  Intended Response(s):</strong></p>
<p>EIA will continue to pursue
  all available avenues of wind industry data, including from international
  markets.  EIA will consider the potential
  applicability of data from non-wind industries facing similar negative community
  reaction.</p>

<p>8.  <u><strong>Oil Production Model</strong>,</u> sometimes called<b> “</b><u>Non-OPEC Oil Production in SAGE</u><b>, </b>Harry Vidas, Contractor to OIAF, EIA</p>
<p><strong><u>Abstract:</u></strong></p>
<p>Harry Vidas from Energy and
  Environmental Analysis (EEA) presented slides describing the World Oil
  Logistics Model (WOLM) that was prepared under contract to EIA.  WOLM is a spreadsheet model that takes a
  long-run crude oil supply curve from EEA’s WAU model
  plus historical production and reserve data and produces a forecast of annual
  crude oil production to 2100 by country as a function of oil price. The model
  is based on a &quot;Hubbert&quot; or
  &quot;Logistic&quot; Curve concept but modifies that concept to account for the
  crude oil supply curve economics and how the price of oil could affect the
  &quot;shape&quot; of the curve (that is, higher oil price will accelerate oil
  exploration and skew the Hubbert curve to the left.)
  The model also calculates reserves, reserve additions, new oil wells drilled
  and the number of operating oil wells as additional outputs.</p>
<p>Mr. Vidas explained that WOLM
  was built to test out data and algorithms that could be used in SAGE to represent
  oil production for non-OPEC regions. The WOLM was built at a country level
  because there are differences in the amount and quality of the data for each
  country.  The country-level structure in
  the model will allow the underlying data to be kept in its original format and
  will permit aggregations into regions using current (or possible future changes
  to) SAGE region definitions. </p>
<p>Mr. Vidas discussed the data
  sources used in the model including:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annual
  production: EIA International Energy Annual 2003</p>

<p>Reliability problems of
  underlying data were discussed and were the inherent uncertainties related to
  resource future technology assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>ASA Committee Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p><b><u>Committee
  Recommendations received from Harry Vidas</u></b></p>
<p>There was general agreement
  in the Committee that the subject matter of how non-OPEC oil production will
  respond to oil prices was an important area of research for EIA to pursue.  There were also comments that the very
  long-run aspect of WOLM and its ability to address the issues surrounding where
  and when conventional oil production peaks and then begins to decline was a
  welcome change in focus that EIA should continue to pursue.</p>
<p>Specific comments and
  suggestion included the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accelerated oil
  production caused by high prices might decrease (rather than, as is assumed in
  the model, increase) ultimate recovery of oil if inefficient production
  techniques are applied, as they were in the 1920’s and 1930’s.  EIA should consider whether this phenomenon
  is possible given current technical understanding and practices.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA should report
  the implied price elasticity for oil production coming from WOLM.  This would be of great interest to analysts
  and would be useful for assuring reasonable results.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA is right to
  be cautious of USGS reserve growth numbers based on
  <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  field growth experience. More
  research into this area may be warranted.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upstream
  technologies that are applied in
  <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
  oil fields may not be applied
  at the same speed or at all in some foreign settings.  This may have implications for costs and
  recovery factors in WOLM as well as the size of potential growth in existing
  fields.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIA should
  consider whether the rate of technical change has accelerated and how that
  might affect how historical data can be used in statistical analyses that
  underlie oil supply forecasting models.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lag effect
  between oil prices and levels of drilling and production should be considered
  carefully.  It may take several years of
  sustained high prices before investments that require high prices are made.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WOLM has a “patch
  work” quality in that the long run oil supply curves are coming from a separate
  model.  It would be better to integrated
  all steps into a single model.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the world
  is diverse and complex, EIA first should concentrate on the top 10 oil
  producing countries in getting more reliable historical data and a reasonable
  forecast.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many
  countries, the political situation and the investment climate may just as
  important as the world price of oil.  Such non-price considerations need also be reflected in EIA’s
  projections.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to
  draw a distinction in such a model between price and price expectations by
  market participants.  The translation
  from forecasted prices to forecasted price expectations should be more
  explicit.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upstream
  technology advances are difficult to analyze in historical context and to model
  for the future.  One perspective that EIA
  should consider is that upstream technology advances are independent of oil
  prices and might be influenced by overall technology advances occurring in the
  economy as a whole.  The reasons behind
  the accelerating rate of economy-wide technical innovation are themselves worth
  investigating.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The definition of
  what is “conventional oil” is important to get right and to apply it
  consistently across all countries.  It is
  also important to have a representation of unconventional oil and how its
  future production will respond to oil prices and future technological
  advances.  </p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some
  instances, conventional and nonconventional oil can
  both exist in the same oil field.  They
  are not necessarily two distinct resource “boxes.”</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There needs to more
  than one “Hubbert curve” to the degree that separate
  resources such as oil shales, oil sands and
  coal-to-liquids are being represented in the model. </p>
<p><strong>EIA
  Intended Response(s):</strong></p>
<p><b><u>Possible EIA Response to Suggestions
  received from Harry Vidas</u></b></p>
<p>EIA is currently
  working with the spreadsheet version of WOLM to better understand how it works
  and what projections it produces under a variety of cases.  EIA will determine whether and how the WOLM
  algorithms should be introduced into SAGE after the evaluation is
  completed.   </p>

  collects data on <i>stocks of other oils</i> on a monthly basis.  However, weekly
  stocks of other oils are estimated from the monthly total petroleum stocks and
  petroleum products supplied because stocks of other oils are not collected on a
  weekly basis.<b> </b>Due to the
  seasonality and other unexpected disruptions, a notable difference was observed
  between EIA’s weekly estimates and the monthly data for the stocks of other
  oils product. Thus, we began to explore other ways to estimate weekly stocks of
  other oils.  Note:  The estimation procedure excluded the weekly
  propane data.  </p>
<p>We evaluated alternative
  methods by comparing the weekly estimates with the <i>Petroleum Supply Monthly (PSM)</i> data.  The PSM data used for estimation purposes
  include weekly data for major oil products, monthly data for major oil products
  and the “Stocks of Other Oils” products.</p>
<p><strong>EIA recommendations are:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To collect weekly
  stocks of other oils from the sampled companies.  Nine of the largest companies may be
  contacted to find out how reasonable it would be for them to report one
  aggregate “other oils stocks” number on a weekly basis.  If ten or more need to be contacted, we can conduct
  a generic clearance to test the feasibility of this collection.  Historically, stocks of other oils were
  difficult to collect, but respondents may now have the data in some automated
  systems.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would strongly
  recommend including the unobserved components model (UCM) to be examined by the
  petroleum products team.  We should also
  reconcile with EMEU to get consensus on how to publish the WPSR and STEO
  estimates of stocks of other oils.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Document the
  procedures/models used to perform the estimation and the rationale for
  selecting the particular estimate, and make sure that the stocks of other oils
  numbers are reproducible.</p>
<p><strong>ASA Committee Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ASA
  committee members, Moshe Feder commented: “Actually I want to say that I like the unobserved components model and
  I think that’s the way to go, but maybe even that can be improved.”  “I cannot speak for the committee but for
  myself, I endorse this approach, I think it’s great, adjusting that --- you
  need to keep working and making sure that those spikes will be smaller.”  “If you have just monthly data, if you put it
  correctly in your model, and you run the model, assuming that the model
  performs well, you will get weekly estimates from the model that should be
  quite good. That is what I suspect. So even if those data are available only
  monthly, since you have – also have other weekly data,
  I think you can actually write a model to use all the data and get the
  estimates that you want.”</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Unobserved
  Components model (UCM) is the right approach. When fitting the Unobserved
  Components model, try to use the monthly seasonality instead of weekly
  seasonality components in the UCM. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plot the whole
  available time series data to evaluate the fitness of the model.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fit the monthly
  and weekly data to the UCM and adjust the models to improve the precision of
  the estimates.</p>
<p>All the BLS estimates of
  unemployment rate are based on state-based modeling, and they use the UCM to
  adjust the rate, there is an ongoing project to do benchmarking to improve the
  precision of those estimates.</p>
<p><strong>EIA
  Intended Response(s)</strong></p>
<p>SMG will fit the Unobserved
  Components model with monthly and weekly data separately to adjust the models’
  fit, then compare the forecast precision with the
  available data series. After adjusting the forecasts’ precision, the fitted UCM
  will be delivered to the Petroleum Supply division to be used in the WSPR
  publication.  </p>

Day="6" Year="2006" w:st="on">
  October 6, 2006 a proposed methodology
  for evaluating NEMS forecasts was presented to the American Statistical
  Association (ASA) Committee on Energy Statistics. NEMS forecasts are made
  conditionally, given a variety of assumptions about future economic conditions
  and other characteristics of energy markets. An evaluation of the forecasts
  calls for identifying the sources of error as they are associated with
  differences between the conditions assumed and those eventually prevailing.
  Sources of error include the following:</p>
<p><i>          Transitory
  Influences, </i>e.g., weather, strikes,
  accidents, embargoes not accounted for in the
  projections.</p>
<p>          <i>Institutional
  Influences</i>, e.g., changes in laws and regulations and changes in data
  series definitions compared to model assumptions.</p>
<p>          <i>Structural
  Influences, </i>e.g., changes in resource availability or energy use technology
  compared to model assumptions.* </p>
<p>          <i>Errors
  in Projecting Conditional Variables, </i>e.g., differences in the eventual
  values of activity drivers and other exogenous factors such as GDP and
  population.*</p>
<p>          <i>Errors in Behavioral
  Parameters, </i>e.g., changes in consumer price sensitivities compared to those
  assumed by the forecasting methodology.*</p>
<p>          <i>Uncertainty</i>,
  e.g., the residual error of the projection method.</p>
<p>An evaluation of long term
  forecasts is complicated by the length of time between the forecast publication
  and the eventual values of the variables projected. It is not practicable to
  retain versions of NEMS associated with past forecasts and re-run the model at
  a future time using the observed, rather than assumed conditional assumptions.
  The proposed evaluation methodology presented to the ASA Committee calls for
  processing NEMS solution data, which can be easily archived, via regression
  analyses of the supply and demand relationships implicit to NEMS representation
  of energy markets. The regression results can be then assessed using observed,
  rather than assumed, values for the conditional variables. The analysis can be
  differentially configured to isolate the impact of each conditional assumption
  upon the differences between forecast and historical values.</p>
<p><b>ASA
  Committee Suggestions:</b></p>
<p>The Committee strongly agreed
  with the goals and method of the proposed forecast evaluation methodology and
  felt that conducting the forecast evaluation was an important tool in assessing
  the merit of long term forecasts. The Committee specifically recommended:</p>
<p>(1) Undertake to develop the
  statistical approximations of NEMS and use the results to assess the sources of
  forecast error.</p>
<p>(2) Conduct the forecast
  evaluation on a regular basis and provide the results as a resource in NEMS
  development.</p>
<p>(3) Select relationships
  submitted to regression analysis so as to enable a statistical  approximation of NEMS itself for major
  categories of energy production and consumption. The resulting system was
  termed by the Committee as “NEMS Lite.” The resulting
  system would provide an integrated assessment of the accuracy of NEMS
  projections.</p>
<p><b>Intended EIA Response(s):</b></p>
<p>A project is now underway to
  complete the specification of the NEMS forecast evaluation methodology. Once
  completed, EIA plans to initiate the development of the evaluation methodology.
  This follow-on project will develop the data and software resources for
  conducting the evaluations and demonstrate the method through assessments of
  the solution data for NEMS solutions produced in support of the Annual Energy
  Outlook (AEO) starting with the 1998 AEO. EIA staff will be trained in
  conducting the evaluations and presenting results on an annual basis. The
  current project and the proposed follow-on are responsive to ASA
  recommendations (1) and (2) above. Expanding the effort to result in a
  statistical approximation of important features of NEMS, a “NEMS Lite” as identified in item (3) above, remains contingent
  on available resources. </p>
