  <p><u>EIA’s Survey Quality Effort: Where is EIA Going?</u>   Shawna Waugh, Statistics and Methods Group (SMG) Moderator, 
    Jim Joosten and Tom Murphy, Coal, Nuclear, Electric and Alternate Fuels (CNEAF), 
    and Nancy Kirkendall, Tom Broene, John Vetter and Howard Bradsher-Fredrick, 
    Facilitator, SMG. </p>
  <p><b>Session Overview</b></p>
  
<p><u>Overview of EIA’s Survey Quality Initiatives</u>, Nancy Kirkendall, Director, 
  Statistics and Methods Group, (SMG) EIA.  EIA is undertaking several initiatives 
  to plan, implement, measure, and evaluate the quality of survey data.  Recent 
  agency-wide quality initiatives include the: EIA Strategic Plan, which emphasizes 
  data quality; EIA’s top ten priorities for 2003, which includes layered performance 
  measures; EIA’s survey quality effort; and the Continuity of Operations (COOP), 
  which demonstrates a need for survey documentation.</p>
  <p>A new initiative will involve survey managers identifying specific indicators 
    of the survey process, and is intended to improve survey process and results.  
    This initiative will involve collaboration between Survey Managers, SMG, and 
    an EIA contractor.</p>
  
<p><b>ASA Committee Advice</b><b> </b></p>
  <p>The Committee agreed that a survey quality initiative would be useful 
    to EIA program and survey managers, and recommended:</p>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
    <li>Developing an assessment tool by and for 
      survey managers to establish targets;</li>
    <li>Recognizing differences among surveys 
      due to context, frequency, scope, budget, and purpose; </li>
    <li>Developing feedback mechanism for diagnosing 
      and treating problems with survey systems</li>
    <li>Adding incentives for major and minor 
      improvements in survey systems; </li>
    <li>Providing survey documentation which is 
      available and up-to-date; and</li>
    <li>Emphasizing the importance of conducting 
      independent survey assessments.</li>
  </ol>
  
<p><b>EIA’s Intended Response to ASA Advice</b><b> </b></p>
  
<p>The project is a joint effort between EIA staff and its contractor, and is 
  in its early stages.   ASA Committee recommendations are under consideration, 
  and decisions will be announced once available. </p>
<strong>Session Overview </strong> 
<p><u>Survey Quality Efforts of the Office of Coal, Nuclear, Electric and Alternate 
  Fuels (CNEAF)</u>, Jim Joosten, CNEAF, EIA </p>
<div class=Section2> 
  <p>This presentation briefly described the type of data 
    collection and processing activities in CNEAF and the various programmatic 
    initiatives that have been undertaken over the last 12 months to improve quality. 
    CNEAF's quality program focuses primarily in the area of developing new Quality 
    Control (QC) measures. It is designed to integrate within the following six 
    core elements of EIA's overall quality program:</p>
  <p class=Level1> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality Policy: How do we 
    prioritize and allocate resources?<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality Standards:  What do we have, how 
    do they apply to the staff and how do we assure compliance with them?<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality Guidelines:  How do we develop sufficiently 
    detailed quality guidance for the staff, and what do we expect them to do 
    with the guidelines?<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality Controls:  What checks do we have 
    to verify that the staff is doing quality work while the work is being done?<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality Assurance:  How does management independently 
    assure itself that the staff’s quality control system is working?<br>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality Improvement:  How do we learn from 
    the system and create a self-adjusting process to make it better? What feedback 
    mechanisms do we have from the staff, contractors, and stakeholders? How do 
    we disposition the feedback? </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The CNEAF Quality Review Board (QRB) plays an important 
    new role in this process and could serve as a model for an EIA-wide quality 
    system.</p>
  <strong>ASA Committee Advice</strong> 
  <p class=MsoHeading8>The ASA first addressed a question of what level of quality 
    control is appropriate for the EIA and</p>
  <p>CNEAF. Rather than merely accept an across- the-board 
    quality program, they suggested a cost-versus-benefit evaluation of the program. 
    In other words, for specific data collection areas, EIA should weigh what 
    it will gain from increased quality controls against the expected resource 
    expenditures. They recommended that EIA design a flexible rather than static 
    quality management system. The ASA supported the idea of developing QC checklists 
    but cautioned that some areas (e.g., improving response rates) may require 
    a different tool. They also cautioned against developing check lists which 
    are too short or too vague so as not to be particularly useful as a quality 
    record or feedback tool to management.</p>
  <p>The ASA favored CNEAF’s creation of a Quality Review 
    Board that meets regularly, and encouraged the EIA to better document and 
    understand its processes as a means to improve quality.  They encouraged CNEAF 
    to develop the QC tools with the full involvement of the survey staff. On 
    the issue of adopting an ISO-9000 quality management program, the ASA committee 
    agreed that CNEAF plans to build quality concepts consistent with that system 
    into its management systems had merit.  But they cautioned against pursuing 
    an ISO 9000 certification as being too costly for too little benefit.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The ASA also encouraged CNEAF to use an internal, independent, 
    peer review process to manage quality, and to exercise final control over 
    the release of its work products.  The Committee also suggested that EIA consider 
    the addition of other quality tools, such as: cognitive testing, respondent 
    debriefings, usability testing, response analysis surveys, etc.</p>
  <p>Finally, to help ensure the sustainability 
    of the quality initiative, the ASA encouraged the EIA to track its quality 
    successes and make them known to the staff as a means to further motivate 
    the staff. </p>
  <strong>EIA’s Intended Response to ASA Advice </strong> 
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In response to the 
    advice provide by the ASA, the EIA Office of Coal, Nuclear, Electric, and 
    Alternative Fuels (CNEAF) has decided to implement the following actions:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Office Quality 
    Management program will be developed with sufficient flexibility and feedback 
    mechanisms so that it can be reviewed on a regular basis, evaluated in terms 
    of cost-versus-benefit, and adjusted.  For example, certain actions aimed 
    at achieving quality excellence (rather than quality minimums) will be included 
    in the Survey Manager’s checklists as a memory aid. However, the manager will 
    have the flexibility to bypass those quality steps provided that they document 
    their rationale for later management review. Additionally, a Quality Improvement 
    program will be developed with periodic input to the QRB so that CNEAF’s initial 
    QA/QC measures are not final but rather adjustable over time as experience 
    is gained. Performance measures will also be developed in the survey process 
    to help management assess the true cost and benefits of the QA/QC/QI program 
    in terms of staff resource usage versus product timeliness and quality.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The operating procedures 
    for each survey will be updated or additional guidance will be provided to 
    survey managers in order to supplement the shorter checklist items. The office 
    will consider the creation of a frames manager or committee to help improve 
    response rates and frame coverage. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The QRB concept will 
    be continued with regular meetings approximately each month, and avenues to 
    expand its coverage of quality issues will be examined.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A formal process such 
    as the ISO 9000 quality system will be used as a model for developing the 
    CNEAF quality documentation systems and quality feedback processes. However, 
    ISO-9000 certification will not be pursued</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The quality tools 
    suggested by the ASA (cognitive testing, respondent debriefings, etc.)  will 
    be included in the checklists as a reminder for consideration.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>An internal web page 
    will be developed to track quality successes, EIA quality issues and successes 
    will be discussed weekly in the CNEAF senior staff meetings, and the possibility 
    for staff quality awards will be considered</p>
  <strong>Session Overview</strong> 
  <p><u>Survey Quality via Performance-Based Service Contracting</u>, 
    Tom Murphy, CNEAF</p>
  <p>One vehicle for improving survey quality is performance-based 
    service contracting (PBSC). This type of contract emphasizes outcomes, rather 
    than process, and thereby encourages contractors to seek the most efficient 
    path to achieve a stated goal.  The five key elements of PBSC include: </p>
  <p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A statement of performance requirements, 
    representing a clear and concise expression of the objectives the contract 
    is expected to achieve. <br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of the performance standards 
    tied to the performance requirements the contractor will be expected to satisfy.<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of the quality assurance performance 
    measures for the performance standards that will be used to evaluate the contractor’s 
    performance;<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A program of positive and negative economic 
    incentives based upon the performance measurements to ensure compliance with 
    performance standards; and <br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A statement of the evaluation 
    criteria upon which the agency will rely in evaluating response to a Request 
    for Proposal</p>
  <p>This session was informational and neither sought nor 
    received suggestions for change or improvement.</p>
  <p><u>Thursday Afternoon, April 3, 2003</u></p>
  <strong>Session Overview </strong> 
  <p><u>New Confidentiality Law and EIA’s Response</u>, Jay Casselberry, SMG, EIA</p>
</div>
<div class=Section3> 
  <p>The E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107-347, was 
    signed into law on December 17, 2002.  Title V of that Act is the Confidential 
    Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA).   
    CIPSEA’s Subtitle A, Confidential Information Protection, affords a possible 
    new level of confidentiality protection to statistical data and information 
    collected by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and other Federal 
    agencies. </p>
  <p>EIA’s first step was to analyze CIPSEA and decide what 
    actions should be taken.  Based on that work, EIA had to resolve questions 
    concerning the Acts’ coverage and requirements, particularly with respect 
    to EIA’s operations.  EIA then established a cross-organizational team to 
    recommend confidentiality to be applied to surveys and to work on operational 
    issues of implementing CIPSEA.</p>
  <strong>ASA Committee Advice </strong> 
  <p>The Committee and Dr. Calvin Kent (past Committee member, 
    previous EIA Administrator and current guest) provided extremely insightful 
    comments on the presentation, the Confidential Information Protection and 
    Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA), and how EIA should address the questions 
    raised.  With regard to sharing of EIA information, the recommendations were 
    that EIA should take a position that it will not release any confidential 
    information for use by others for regulatory or legal purposes.  EIA should 
    beforehand address what information will be available to other agencies, under 
    what conditions, and be prepared for the consequences if EIA chooses not to 
    provide information for nonstatistical uses.  The Committee also recommended 
    developing informed consent materials before needed and creating data sharing agreements and procedures that 
    strictly control all aspects of shared confidential information.</p>
  <strong>EIA’s Intended Response to ASA Advice </strong> 
  <p>EIA is still addressing how best to change in response 
    to CIPSEA.  A limited number of surveys will be included under CIPSEA, which 
    will preclude any nonstatistical uses for information from those surveys.  
    For confidential surveys that are not collected under CIPSEA, EIA will continue 
    to resist any nonstatistical uses, but must accept the fact that laws require 
    sharing for official uses and do not provide strong support for resisting 
    nonstatistical requests.  EIA will need to use its political and persuasive 
    skills to avoid the potential for inappropriate uses of non-CIPSEA confidential 
    information.  EIA will be modifying its confidential wording, data sharing 
    agreements, and internal controls in light of CIPSEA.  EIA will also need 
    to develop appropriate procedures for agents handling CIPSEA data.  OMB will 
    be providing more guidance on that topic.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>Session Overview</strong></p>
  <p><u>An Alternative Natural Gas Production Estimation 
    Procedure</u>, Crystal Linkletter, 
    ASA Fellowship recipient, and Professor Randy Sitter, ASA Committee member</p>
  <p>There exists a delay between the production of natural gas in Texas and the 
    reporting of that production. As a result, the true volume of natural gas 
    produced in a month is not known until a year or more after production. It 
    is important to have earlier and more accurate production estimates, and some 
    estimation procedures have already been considered. The focus of this presentation 
    was to look at alternative procedures that give reasonably accurate production 
    volumes no more than three months after production. </p>
  </div>
<div class=Section4> 
  <p>One very intuitive approach involves inflating 
    the latest available reported totals by a ratio that takes into consideration 
    the right-truncation of the data. This method performs reasonably well, and 
    does not require the collection of much data. A second approach relies on 
    the nonparametric estimation of the conditional reporting lag distribution. 
    This is the methodology commonly used to adjust for reporting delays in AIDS 
    research and in the construction of product warranty databases. This procedure 
    is very easy to apply to the natural gas production data, has the greatest 
    efficiency of all the procedures considered, and allows for the construction 
    of prediction intervals.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>ASA Committee Advice </strong></p>
  <p>Use of well level data or even regional data 
    would probably be better than the aggregated data obtained from the Texas 
    Railroad commission.  But, given that at present we only have the aggregated 
    data, the non-parametric method just described by Crystal Linkletter, described 
    in this session is the best method to use. This method had the smallest mean 
    squared errors of any of the alternative methods. There are three additional 
    reasons for preferring this method: 1) It is known to work well in other areas, 
    such as AIDS research and Product Warranty Research, 2) It is simple to use, 
    requiring only simple sums in a spreadsheet, and 3) One can construct confidence 
    intervals on the predicted values.  For these reasons the ASA committee recommended 
    the use of the non-parametric model described in this session.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>EIA Intended Response to ASA Advice</strong></p>
  <p>SMG has implemented the non-parametric model 
    and will provide predicted values to the EIA Office of Oil and Gas (OOG). 
    The model results will be evaluated and a final determination will be made 
    by OOG after the initial review.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>Session Overview</strong></p>
  <p><u>EIA’s (Draft) Electricity Transmission Study: 
    What the Data Show</u>, Douglas R. Hale, Statistics and Methods 
    Group, EIA.</p>
  <p>EIA is responsible for collecting, maintaining 
    and analyzing data on energy prices, infrastructure and trends in supply and 
    demand.  Historically, EIA’s data collection and analysis efforts in the power 
    sector have focused on generation (production) and the demand             
    for electricity.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has generally 
    collected information on capacity and investments in the electricity transmission 
    sector.  Although the qualitative effects of transmission on prices and interregional 
    trade are understood, there is currently limited factual and analytic basis 
    for appraising how well regional grids are evolving to support competition.  
    This report will assess whether publicly available transmission data and analysis 
    tools answer questions important to resolving public policy issues.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>ASA Committee Advice</strong></p>
</div>
<div class=Section5> 
  <p>Dr. Calvin Kent, guest of the ASA Committee, 
    was concerned about the cost and political fallout from EIA taking on transmission 
    data and analysis. Ultimately, that is the EIA Administrator's and the Department 
    of Energy's call. EIA’s goal in this study is to figure out how much would 
    need to be done by someone to get the data to support policy analysis.</p>
  <p>Dr. Kent had specific comments as well.  
    He suggested EIA:</p>
  <p>1. Focus on investment, defined broadly enough to include more than lines<br>
    2. Incorporate homeland security concerns explicitly in the report.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>EIA’s Intended Response to ASA Advice</strong></p>
  <p>Dr. Hale currently intends to take both suggestions.<u></u></p>
  <p><u>Friday Morning, April 4, 2003</u></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>Session Overview</strong></p>
  <p><u>Redesign of the EIA-906, Power Plant Report</u>, Stan Freedman, Statistics and Methods Group, and Bob Schnapp, CNEAF, EIA.</p>
  <p>Form EIA-906, Power Plant Report, collects information from all regulated 
    and unregulated electric power plants in the United States. Data collected 
    include electric power generation, energy source consumption, fossil fuel 
    stocks, and useful thermal output (UTO) from combined heat and power plants 
    (CHP).  Examples of CHP plants are industrial cogenerators such as some paper 
    mills and chemical plants.  EIA publishes UTO and electricity generated by 
    CHP plants.  Useful thermal output is the thermal energy made available for 
    processes and applications other than electrical generation. EIA uses a facility’s 
    reported total fuel consumption and UTO to calculate, essentially as a difference, 
    the amount of fuel used by CHP plants to produce electricity.</p>
  <p>EIA collects UTO and uses it as a means 
    for determining fuel for electricity because of a belief that CHP respondents 
    do not typically have metered or estimated values for fuel used to produce 
    electricity.  However, we have found that respondents have difficulty in reporting 
    UTO, and in some cases they do not measure useful thermal output.</p>
  <p>EIA recently began the redesign of the EIA-906. 
    At this point, EIA has completed a survey concepts analysis and has scheduled 
    several pre-survey design visits for March to see if respondents have the 
    data EIA wants and can provide it to the agency in the form and periodicity 
    EIA requires.</p>
  <p>Using the information collected from the 
    pre-survey design visits, EIA will construct data collection options from 
    which it will chose one to construct a prototype survey.  EIA will then cognitively 
    test the prototype with approximately a dozen CHP respondents. This is scheduled 
    for May and June 2003.</p>
  <p>EIA wants the Committee’s advice on how 
    to collect the data for the redesigned EIA-906, forms design, and cognitive 
    testing of the draft instrument.</p>
</div>
<div class=Section6> 
  <p>If cleared by the Office of Management and 
    Budget, the new survey will be sent to respondents in 2004.</p>
  <p>These were the questions that Stan Freedman 
    and Bob Rutchik asked the Committee:</p>
  <p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should EIA ask respondents for additional 
    information to calculate the estimates, and continue to perform the computations 
    for fuel use here?<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we have the respondents perform their 
    own fuel consumption calculations?<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there alternatives?</p>
<b>ASA Committee Advice to EIA</b>
  <p>The Committee stated that there was no easy 
    answer to determine how much fuel combined heat and power (CHP) plants use 
    to produce electricity. They were not convinced, however, that permitting 
    CHP respondents to calculate their own fuel use was the way that EIA should 
    precede. They did not think that the respondents would produce accurate data. 
    </p>
  <p>The sense of the Committee, after a great 
    deal of discussion, was that EIA could construct a respondent model. This 
    model would be a combination of stratifying the respondents= by plant characteristics 
    and certain Abaseline@ variables common to all plants. Using this model, EIA 
    could survey the most problematic respondents, the ones that most affect the 
    precision of the CHP fuel use estimate, and do the fuel use calculations. 
    </p>
<b>EIA’s Intended Response to ASA Advice</b>
  <p>EIA soon is going to test cognitively a redesigned 
    EIA-906 that asks CHP respondents to calculate the fuel that they use to produce 
    electricity. EIA believes it does not have the resources at this point to 
    construct a respondent model.<u></u></p>
  <p><b>Session Overview</b><u></u></p>
  <p><u>Using Data from Combined Heat and Power 
    Plants to Estimate Natural Gas Industrial Prices,</u> Ruey-Pyng Lu, Statistics and Methods Group, 
    EIA.<u></u></p>
  <p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA) 
    collects and publishes data on prices and volumes of natural gas delivered 
    to customers in five sectors (residential, commercial, industrial, vehicle 
    fuel, and electric utilities). EIA has been obtaining the data by surveying 
    local utilities and pipeline companies. Since industrial customers bought 
    more natural gas from marketers or suppliers than their local utilities, EIA’s 
    natural gas prices for the industrial sector represent only about 18% of the 
    gas consumed in that sector.</p>
  <p>In 2000 SMG contracted with the Census Bureau 
    to conduct a feasibility study for surveying natural gas customers in the 
    manufacturing sector (based on a frame maintained by the Census Bureau). The 
    feasibility study demonstrated that the required information could be collected. 
    However, the estimated cost exceeded EIA’s budget. EIA is studying alternatives 
    to estimate natural gas industrial price.</p>
</div>
<div class=Section7> 
  <p>Many industrial facilities that consume 
    natural gas use it to generate electricity and now report on the EIA-423 (Monthly 
    Report of Cost and Quality of Fuels for Electric Plants). The EIA-423 surveys 
    all facilities with a nameplate capacity of 50 megawatts or greater and collects 
    information about cost and quality of all fuels used to generate electricity. 
    It is hoped that by matching the natural gas consumers in the EIA-423 with 
    the natural gas customers in the EIA-176 (Annual Report of Natural and Supplemental 
    Gas Supply and Disposition), a model can be developed to estimate the price 
    of natural gas used in the industrial sector. <u></u></p>
  <p>We have six months, January 2002 to June 
    2002, of EIA-423 data available to investigate the potential relationship 
    of natural gas price and volume. But the data sets need more editing to verify 
    the responses, there are some questionable responses in each month, and the 
    EIA-423 survey manager is investigating those responses. Through the exploratory 
    data analysis, there seems no apparent relationship between natural gas price 
    and volume at all at national or census region level. We will compare the 
    EIA-857 natural gas monthly data with EIA-423 data to establish a correlation 
    to adopt a proxy for the industrial price. This session will represent the 
    work done to date and solicit the committee’s advice.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><strong>Summary of Advice to the EIA</strong></p>
  ASA Committee on Energy Statistics advice:</p>
  <p>ASA Committee on Energy Statistics stated 
    that there are three available sources of data from surveys on natural gas 
    prices of industrial sector, EIA-423, FERC 423 and EIA-857. These multiple 
    series are useful, and perhaps it wasn’t so useful to work hard on finding 
    a way to aggregate them into one number that could be called the average price 
    paid by the industrial sector. EIA may put out two series, data from EIA-423 
    and EIA-857, and it would be useful to characterize the coverage of those 
    different series and survey frames because there may be some overlap between 
    these surveys. It also sort of forces people who would want to just get the 
    number from EIA, to sort of recognize that’s maybe not what they might want 
    to do, and there is no single number that answer this question very well, 
    and they shouldn’t pretend that there is one.</p>
  <p><b>EIA’s Intended Response to 
    ASA Advice</b></p>
  <p>We will report two price data series from EIA-423 and EIA-857 surveys, along 
    with their coverage and frames From these surveys, hopefully we can work out 
    a model which can be used to estimate natural gas prices for the industrial 
    sector at the census region level. One other alternative is to use other natural 
    gas price series, such as the natural gas wellhead price or Henry hub price 
    to develop a model and use it to estimate the natural gas price for the industrial 
    sector.</p>
