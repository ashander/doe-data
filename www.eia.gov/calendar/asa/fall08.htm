    1.  <u>Preliminary Results of Energy
  Consumer Price Index Research</u>, Janice Lent, Statistics and Methods Group (SMG)</b></p>
<p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA)
    is researching estimation methods with the goal of developing an experimental
    Energy Consumer Price Index (ECPI), based almost entirely on EIA data.  For some major energy sources, EIA collects
    universe or large-sample price and sales data, which can be used to compute
    price indexes with very low sampling error. Also, EIA’s model-based projections of future energy prices and
    consumption levels can be used to develop CPI forecasts for some energy
    components. Because the experimental
    indexes are being computed in a research environment rather than in a
    large-scale production environment, the process of incorporating data from new
    energy surveys will be streamlined.  In
    this paper, we provide background information and preliminary results of EIA’s
    ECPI estimation research.  We also
  discuss some producer price indexes that could be estimated using EIA data.Questions for the Committee:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="text-align:justify;
">1) Given
        that our experimental ECPI closely tracks the energy component of the BLS CPI
        for the period examined, should EIA move forward to produce the ECPI on a
        regular basis?  </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;
">2) Which
    of the producer price index targets discussed would be most relevant for policy
  makers and the general public?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
    <p>Because the experimental ECPI
    series closely tracks the energy component of the BLS CPI for the period
    examined, the Committee was asked to comment on the value of producing the ECPI
    on a regular basis. Also, the Committee
    was asked to judge the relative value of two proposed PPI series: (1) a PPI to track prices of fuels used for
    electricity generation and (2) a PPI to track prices of residential solar
  energy equipment.</p>
    <p> The Committee’s reaction to the
    experimental ECPI series presented was mixed. Some members suggested that, due to the similarity between the ECPI and
    the energy component of the BLS CPI, EIA should not pursue the goal of
    publishing a new index series. Others,
    however, saw the differences between the two series as potentially important. It was noted, for example, that, during times
    of structural change in the energy industries, the EIA series would be likely
    to detect changes sooner than the BLS series. (The weights used in computing the BLS CPI are based on data from the
    Consumer Expenditure Survey; the reference periods for the weights are generally
  two to three years prior to those for the indexes.)</p>
    <p>With regard to the suggested PPI
    series, Committee members generally favored the solar energy equipment series
    over the PPI for fuels used in electricity generation.  Because electric power generators incur other
    costs in addition to fuel costs, some members suggested that a PPI reflecting
    only fuel costs may seem incomplete. (BLS produces a PPI for the electric power industry that covers other
    costs in addition to fuel costs.) One
    Committee felt strongly that EIA should try to measure changes in the cost of
  wind energy equipment.</p>
    <p><b><i>EIA Intended Response(s):</i></b></p>
    <p>EIA will continue research on the
    ECPI. The PPI for solar energy equipment
    will also be investigated as resources permit. EIA currently does not collect data on the cost of wind energy equipment. The option
    of calculating a synthetic CPI for wind energy equipment will be
    investigated.  The synthetic statistic
    would be based on various commodity components of the BLS PPI (e.g., turbine
    parts) with weights reflecting the relative importance (or expenditure share)
  of each component in the production of wind energy equipment.</p>
    <p>      <b>2.  <u>Estimating Monthly Ethanol Consumption in the
      </u></b><b><u>
      U.S.
      </u>,
    Carol Joyce Blumberg and Michael Conner,
  Petroleum Division (PD), Office of Oil and Gas (OOG) </b>      </p>
    <p>Presently, EIA has two methods of
    estimating ethanol consumption in the  
      U.S.
  from published data.  These are:</p>
  <p>Method 1: Consumption is estimated using a Product
    Supplied formula of: Consumption for Ethanol = (Net
  Production for ethanol + Imports of ethanol) –– (Stock Change in ethanol)</p>
  <p> Method 2: Consumption for ethanol = .09&#8729;(Monthly-from-Weekly estimate of reformulated
    gasoline with alcohol production volume + Monthly-from-Weekly estimate of conventional
  gasoline with alcohol production volume)</p>
<p>A third method (Method 3) is
    available that uses unpublished data that are at a finer level than the
  published data.</p>
    <p>Method 3: Consumption for ethanol = .09&#8729;(Monthly unpublished reformulated gasoline with
    alcohol production volume + Monthly unpublished conventional gasoline with
  alcohol production volume)</p>
<p>Method 2 uses a sample each week
    and does not include corrections by respondents after the data collection date,
    while Methods 1 and 3 are based on a census and allow for respondent
  corrections.</p>
<p>Using multiple linear regression, it was found that Method 1 and a variation on
      Method 3 give nearly identical estimates and that Method 2 produces biased
      estimates. </p>
        <p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
    <p>Only one member of the Committee
    made a suggestion. He suggested that we
    revise our weekly estimates of motor gasoline volumes once we have the monthly
    estimates of motor gasoline volumes. This way, we would have the final weekly estimates better match with the
  monthly estimates.</p>
    <p><b><i>EIA Intended Response(s):</i></b></p>
    <p>While the suggestion from that
    committee member has merit, the official revision policy is that “EIA will
    disseminate revised weekly data only if the revision is expected to substantively affect understanding of
    U.S.
    petroleum supply. The decision
    to disseminate a revision to weekly data will be based on EIA’s judgment of the revision’s expected effect.  While
    revisions are expected to be rare, if one is necessary, it will be disseminated in the next regularly
  scheduled release of the weekly products.” (quoted from explanatory notes in Weekly Petroleum Status Report)</p>
<p><b>3.</b>  <b><u>Time Limits For Protecting Company Level
  Data</u>, Jacob Bournazian, SMG</b></p>
<p>EIA protects a majority of the survey information that it collects by using Exemption (4) four under section 552 of the Freedom of Information Act.  Exemption four allows the government to withhold from release to the public certain documents in its possession if the information would likely cause substantial harm to a survey respondent&rsquo;s competitive position.  This presentation will discuss how the passage of time affects the potential that a respondent may suffer competitive harm if EIA released historical company level data that was reported on an EIA survey.  The presentation discussed how the passage of time affects the risk that a respondent may suffer competitive harm if EIA released historical company level data that was reported on an EIA survey.  Feedback was collected during the session on the factors that affect a company&rsquo;s competitive position in an energy market and whether EIA should consider releasing more historical company level survey data after a certain period of time has passed.</p>
<p><u>QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE</u></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> 1) How does the age of the survey data affect the need to protect it?<br>
      2)  Should time limits be considered for protecting company level data where EIA is not
  obligated by statute to protect it?<br>
      3)  What economic factors should be considered when considering a time limit for
  protecting company level data?<br>
      4)  What interrelationships between economic factors should be considered?<br>
      5)  How may the interrelationship between economic factors that may exist in an energy
    market increase or decrease the risk of causing competitive harm to a survey
  respondent by releasing historical company level data? </p>
</blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>ASA Committee Recommendations:</strong></em> </p>
    <p>The committee members recommended asking specific energy industry groups if they would object to EIA releasing their data after a certain specified time period and then deciding whether to set a time limit and what the time period should be.  In the meantime, EIA should consider placing company level data in a data enclave for researchers or releasing more public use data files with direct identifiers removed to prevent the identifiability of respondents. </p>
    <p><em><strong>EIA Intended Response: </strong></em></p>
    <p>EIA decided not to set time limits for protecting the confidentiality of company level data and will explore alternatives for expanding researcher access to survey data. </p>

<p><b>4A.  <u>Analyzing</u><u> the STB’s Carload Waybill Sample</u></b>, <b>Vlad Dorjets, CNEAF</b></p>
<p>  EIA recently obtained a database from the Surface
    Transportation Board with a statistical sample of all railroad waybills for
    movements of coal and other energy commodities throughout the country for 2000-2006. This presentation discusses characteristics of  the database, the approach this office
    has taken to analyze it and the products they hope to create from it. It also discusses the challenge of using this
  particular sample to represent a population.</p>

<p><b>4B.  <u>Modeling</u><u> International Renewable Trade Sources</u>, Brian Murphy, OIAF</b></p>
<p>This is a presentation of the
    author’s work on improving our modeling of international renewable energy
    sources. In the past, our long-term projections for the International Energy
    Outlook have aggregated hydroelectricity and all other marketed renewable
    energy sources. The work involves regional projections of individual renewable
    sources, including hydroelectricity, wind, solar, and geothermal for use in our
    IEO2009. The presentation addresses the modeling approach and preliminary
    results of this effort.  It discusses the new “bottom-up”
    approach that is being used for renewable electricity in this year’s
    International Energy Outlook, and the challenges of building a model for an
  industry (renewables) shaped primarily by policy, not cost.</p>
    <p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
<p>Committee
    members recommended improving the renewable electricity forecast by
    incorporating resource maps of renewable resources and separating the analysis
    of newer renewable electricity technologies (<i>i.e.</i>, wind, solar, and
    geothermal) from mature technologies (large hydroelectricity). The
    committee also recommended conducting multiple renewable electricity forecasts
    scenarios to better account for a variety of model assumptions. Rapid and
    slow technology improvement scenarios and various carbon tax scenarios were
    recommended. In addition, the committee advised investigating the
    correlation between growth in renewable electricity equipment manufacturing and
    the growth in renewable electricity generation, as well as the relationship
    between pro-renewable government policies and the renewable electricity cost
  premium (compared to conventional sources).    </p>
<p><b><i>EIA
  Intended Response(s):</i></b>&nbsp;
</p>
  After
    establishing a price elasticity of demand for electricity from renewable
    sources, numerous carbon tax cases were run to address the committee’s
    recommendation for multiple scenario forecasts. EIA is also in the
    process of assessing available renewable resource maps to determine which maps
    contain the level of detail necessary to improve the electricity
    forecast. After careful analysis of the renewable electricity forecast
    generated by the current methodology, EIA has decided to attempt to modify the
    renewable electricity model to incorporate technology cost – the remainder of
    the committee’s recommendations should be addressed with the release of the updated
  model.<b> </b>

<p><b>4C.  <u>Modeling</u><u> International Biofuels Supplies</u>, Emre Yucel, OIAF</b></p>
  <p>Liquid biofuels are becoming more
    and more popular as a transportation fuel. In order to better project world
    liquids supply the biofuels component of it must be modeled accurately. Different
    initial modeling approaches were presented, one that relied on available land
  use, and one that utilized supply curves created using cost data.
</p>
  <p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
<p>The committee recommended that
    the costs and effects of converting idle land to crop land be considered. It
  was also recommended that the availability of water resources be evaluated.</p>
  <p><b><i>EIA Intended Response(s):</i></b></p>
<p>A model that has a number of
    modules will be implemented. This will include a transportation and food crop
    module to better model the competition between the two for fuel use. The amount
    of feedstock produced will be dependent on the cost of using the land for
    feedstock production, and feedstock growth will be dependent on the cost to
  convert new land.</p>

  <p><b>6. <u>Sensitivity Analysis of EIA Forecasting Systems</u>,
  Preston McDowney, SMG and George Lady, Consultant to SMG</b></p>
  <p>This paper reports upon
    sensitivity analyses conducted with the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS)
    and the Regional Short Term Energy Model (RSTEM). Sensitivities were developed
    for NEMS consuming sector modules (residential, commercial, industrial, and
    transportation) using a regression analysis for data extracted from NEMS
    solutions for which energy prices and activity drivers were systematically
    varied. These results were reported to the ASA Committee in October 2007. For
    this report, sensitivities to weather were also investigated. Based upon the
    regressions and weather variable analyses, error decomposition was conducted
    for the <i>AEO1998-AEO2003 </i>versions of
    NEMS with respect to projections for the year 2006 for residential and
    commercial sector electricity and natural gas consumption. A sensitivity
    analysis was conducted at the census region level of detail for price, driver,
    and weather variables for RSTEM forecasting equations for residential and
    commercial sector electricity and natural gas consumption. Similar
    sensitivities for were found for NEMS at the census region level of detail.
  These results are reported here for comparative purposes.</p>
  <p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
  <p>The Committee was favorable to
    the goals of the project and the methodology utilized. It was pointed out that,
    in addition to explaining the basis for differences between forecast values and
    eventually realized values, the method  would also serve a model validation
    function by revealing how NEMS accounted for weather and the other exogenous
    variables. It was additionally proposed that the roster of influences on
    forecast accuracy included many variables that the methodology was not accounting
    for. Subject to resource and other constraints, it was recommended to consider
    expanding the list of exogenous variables to account for. Finally, it was noted
    that a number of recent inquiries about the “accuracy” of NEMS projections
    could have been substantially responded to if the proposed methodology had been
    in place. The Committee recommended that the methodology presented be
  established and provide regular reports on the basis for forecast accuracy.</p>
  <p><b><i>EIA Intended Response(s):</i></b></p>
  <p> EIA has continued to sponsor the
  project. Current goals are to expand the scope of variables included and apply
  the method to each <i>AEO </i>version of
    NEMS as archived versions  become available. The first version of NEMS used for the project
    was NEMS2007. Stand alone NEMS projections for this version do not begin until
    2010. When actual data for the exogenous variables in the year 2010 become
  available, the first impact analysis using the methodology will be implemented.</p>
  <p><b>7.  <u>Assessment of RSTEM
  Forecasts</u>, Andrew J. Buck, Consultant to SMG</b></p>
  <p>This paper reports on forecast
    analyses conducted with the Regional Short Term Energy Model (RSTEM). Forecasts
    were developed for consuming sectors (residential, commercial and industrial)
    using the October 2007 release of RSTEM.  The forecasted fuels were natural gas, electricity, and distillate. For natural gas and electricity the forecasts
    were generated for the nine census regions. The commercial and industrial distillate forecasts for geographic
    regions were based on the set of fourteen areas created from the nine census
    regions. Residential distillate
    consumption forecasts were developed for four geographic aggregates of the nine
    census regions. For each fuel -- region
    doublet the October forecast was compared to the realized data reported in May
    2008, using % error. The October model
    was rerun using the realized values for the exogenous variables and the
    endogenous variable add factors. The %
    forecast error was again
    calculated. Finally, the October model
    was rerun using the realized values for the exogenous variables and no add
    factors for the endogenous variables.  The % forecast error was again calculated.</p>
  <p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
  <p>1. The
    Los
    Alamos Laboratories have experience with complex computer model
    validation<br>
        2. Clarification of the use of add factors in out of sample forecasts was requested, as was
    the use of levels and changes of the dependent variable.  The add factors serve two purposes: The need
    for them even when the exogenous data is known implies model inadequacy. When
    used for an out-of-sample forecast they provide an evaluation of the modeler's
    ability to compensate for unobservables.  If the model is in levels then it begs the
    question of stationarity of the dependent variable.<br>
        3. There is a literature on the
    use of preliminary data that should be reviewed.<br>
    
    4. Are there private sources of
    weather data?<br>
    
    5. ANOVA might be a useful way to
    identify the important sources of forecast errors.<br>
    6. Are there other regional
    energy models in use and what is their performance record?<br>
    
    7. Is there a process to find
better specifications?</p>
    <p><b><i>EIA Intended Response(s):</i></b>
</p>
    
    1. Checking on computer model validation conducted at
    Los Alamos
    will be pursued in a timely fashion.<br>
    
    2. The participant's comments are
    quite correct. The question of stationarity will be pursued, although it is
    worth noting that the use of lagged endogenous variables is an implicit
    unrestricted correction for non-stationarity.<br>
    
    3. I will investigate the
    existence of a literature on the use of preliminary data.<br>
    
    4. I will look into the existence
    of non-proprietary weather data.<br>
        5. I will have to consider the
    possibility of automating an ANOVA routine across the six different fuels and
    nine regions, or 54 equation specifications.  Part of the difficulty stems from the diversity of specifications by
    fuel and region.<br>
        6. &amp; 7. I will ask the RSTEM staff for their input in regard to other regional energy
    models and equation up-dates.
    </p>

  <p>At bottom, the ASA Committee felt
    that there were no serious problems in the RSTEM Forecast Assessment project
    and recommended that the project continue.</p>

      of 2008 EIA 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Energy Conference Survey</u>, Howard
    Bradsher-Fredrick and Phillip Tseng, SMG and Michael Salpeter, Summer Intern</b></p>
  <p>On 
    April 7-8, 2008, EIA hosted an energy
    conference to commemorate and celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of its
    inception. The presenters included the
    current Secretary of Energy, the first secretary, representatives of Congress,
    former EIA administrators and other notable experts in the field of energy. A
    total of 1,559 persons registered for the conference and 1,150 persons attended
  the conference. Shortly after the conclusion of
    the conference, a web-based survey was administered to all of the attendees (a
    total of 1,060) who provided usable e-mail addresses. This paper describes the survey methodology
    employed, the results and the final conclusions. A response rate of 41.5% was achieved
    through the use of three e-mailings (the original and two follow-ups).  The survey included both closed-ended and
    open-ended questions. These results
    indicated that respondents were generally very favorable toward the conference
and will be of value in planning the next EIA energy conference. </p>
  <p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
<p>Good survey, good methodology,
    great response rate.  It is good to be
    using a current e-mail list and good to keep the questionnaire short.  As another piece of information concerning
    the demographics of the respondents, it might be useful to know who the
    respondent works for (a general classification of some type). It is important
    to separate renewable energy from alternative fuels so one can differentiate
    between them in the analysis. Also, how far the person traveled in order to
    attend the conference might be interesting. Also, it would be interesting to
    know which respondents are EIA employees, so that question should be
  asked. It was thought that a higher
    response rate would be attained through a web-based survey rather than using a
    paper survey.  However, the results from
    a paper survey might provide better results since it would involve a more
  immediate reaction to the conference.</p>
  <p><b><i>EIA Intended Response(s):</i></b></p>
  <p>EIA will attempt to keep its
    customer surveys short and concise preceded by a well thought-out research
    design. We will also attempt to use a
    current e-mail list whenever possible so as to optimize the response rate.  If EIA staff members are allowed to respond
    to a customer survey, we should attempt to stratify their responses for the
    purposes of analysis.  We will also use
  web-based customer surveys whenever possible as opposed to paper surveys. </p>
