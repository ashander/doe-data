    A Case Study of the American Statistical Association (ASA) Committee on Energy

<p style='text-autospace:none'>The
    energy crisis of the 1970’s brought about the creation of the U. S. Department
    of Energy, which was created by congress in 1977.  As a statistical organization within the
    Department of Energy, the Energy Information Administration integrated the
    activities of more than fifty different government agencies.  Recognizing the need for a <span
style='font-size:11.5pt;color:black'>central, comprehensive and unified energy
    data and information program, the EIA collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes
    and disseminates data and information which is relevant to energy resource
    reserves, energy production, demand and technology, and related economic and
  statistical information.  </span></p>
<p>To assist the organization in this effort, the EIA initiated
    the development of an advisory program. The American Statistics Association’s
    (ASA) Committee on Energy Statistics was created for this purpose.   The committee meets twice a year, reviews
    elements of EIA’s data collection and analysis programs and offers advice on
    various aspects of EIA’s work, such as matters concerning energy modeling and
  forecasting.</p>
<p style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;color:black'>This paper reviews the history of the ASA
    Committee on Energy Statistics and examines its advisory role, its interactions
    with EIA and its effectiveness from the standpoint of its members.  This discussion presents a welcome
    opportunity to obtain input from the committee regarding EIA’s future
  direction.</span></p>

<p><b>2. <u>Modeling Peak Oil Production</u>,</b> John Holte,
  
  Lauren
  Mayne, John Staub, and Glen Sweetnam, OIAF, EIA</p>
<p>Recent increases in oil prices and unanticipated delays in
    non-OPEC oil exploration and development projects have raised concerns that
    global oil production may be nearing a peak.  In order to improve its ability to generate long-term oil production
    projections, the Energy Information Administration has developed the
  International Petroleum Production Model (IPPM). </p>
<p>The IPPM is an economic model that schedules investment in
    new petroleum liquids production capacity for six resource types in each of
    five producing regions.  Production from
    new production capacity added by the model is scheduled according to an
  exogenous, predetermined production profile.  The resource types in the current version of the model are: </p>
<p>Conventional crude and lease condensate<br>
Natural gas plant liquids (NGPL)<br>
Extra heavy crude oil<br>
Bitumen<br>
Shale oil (kerogen)<br>
Crude oil from source rocks <br>
</p>
<p> The regions in the current model are:<br>
<st1:place w:st="on">
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
    States</st1:country-region>
  <br>
Other non-OPEC<br>
<st1:place w:st="on">
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">Saudi
    Arabia</st1:country-region>
  <br>
Other Middle East OPEC<br>
Other OPEC </p>
<p>The model adds new production capacity in a manner that
    maximizes producer surplus (net present value - NPV) of the capacity additions
    consistent with exogenous, pre-determined constraints.  The primary constraint is that production
    must equal an exogenous, pre-determined consumption trajectory in each year
    (2008 – 2200 in the current version of the model).  Other constraints are typically associated
    with government or national oil company decisions to restrict capacity
    additions to maintain a certain market share of the market (e.g. Saudi Arabia)
    or to address environmental concerns (e.g., Alberta oil sands).  The NPV of additions are calculated using
    assumptions about capital (finding and development - F&amp;D) and operating
    costs, tax rates, and a pre-determined oil price trajectory.  The model uses exogenous assumptions of initial-in-place
    (IIP) quantities and ultimate recovery factors (RF) for each resource in each
    region.  F&amp;D costs rise as cumulative
    additions to production capacity approach the product of IIP and RF and decline
  as technology advances.     </p>
<p>ASA Committee members will be asked to comment on the
    appropriateness of the proposed model structure/design for modeling future oil
    industry behavior and to provide suggestions as to how more accurate estimates
    of key parameters (e.g., regional finding and development costs) might be
  obtained or derived.</p>
<p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations:</i></b></p>
<p>Committee members recommended that the International
    Petroleum Production Model (IPPM) should be reconstructed to operate as a
    general equilibrium model, incorporating demand curves in place of candidate
    consumption trajectories and solving for the world oil price, rather than
    receiving this as an input.  The
    committee also recommended that the grouping of resource owners and liquids
    suppliers be further disaggregated, rather than limited to only four country
    groupings.  Committee members also
    suggested that sensitivity analysis should be conducted on several input
    assumptions, including IIP and RF estimates.  In addition, it was suggested that more logic should be integrated into
    the modeled market structure, allowing for a greater diversity of noneconomic
    based production decisions than were addressed in the version of the IPPM
  presented.  </p>
<p><b><i>EIA Intended Response(s):</i></b></p>
<p>To address the committee’s sensitivity analysis
    recommendation, several additional IPPM runs based on lower IIP and RF assumptions
    were conducted and summarized in the yet to be published EIA whitepaper on peak
    oil.  After careful consideration, EIA
    decided that other committee recommendations were inappropriate to include in
    the IPPM due to the model’s particularly long time frame.  These recommendations, however, were
    incorporated into other modeling efforts, primarily the WEPS+ model, supporting
    EIA’s International Energy Outlook (IEO), the projection period of which is
    limited to 25 years.  The incorporation
    of these recommendations resulted in three significant and ongoing changes to
    the WEPS+ model.  First, resource
    estimates supporting liquids supply projections in WEPS+ were expanded from
    reports of proved reserves to include estimates of IIP and RF for conventional
    crude and lease condensate.  Second, the
    IIP estimates included in WEPS+ were disaggregated to the country level.  And third, the price scenarios presented in
    the IEO2008 (and used as a basis for the AEO2009) expressed a much wider range
    of possible future noneconomic driven production decisions than previous
  outlooks.</p>
<p><b>3.  <u>Web Customer Survey and New Web Directions</u>, </b>Colleen
  Blessing and Nicholas Johnson, NEIC</p>
<p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA) web site is
    central to accomplishing its mission, including the charge, &quot;to promote
    public understanding&quot; of energy.  We
    have recently introduced new features and updated our home page to support this
    mission.  The session will briefly
  present these changes on EIA's web site.</p>
<p>We reorganized the EIA home page based on usability testing
    results to group like information and show more of the most popular items.  We added a graphical feature box to the home
    page to help EIA promote specific content.  We placed an improved A-Z Topics feature on the home page to support new
  ways to look for information.</p>
<p>We also launched a new series aimed at educating the curious
    novice about energy issues.  The series
    is called Energy in Brief and answers popular or important energy questions in
    a one- to two-page format online with graphs, charts and easy-to-understand
    text.  The series will occasionally
    include articles to educate the public about statistical questions and
    misconceptions.  For example, we may
    write about the difference between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends
  in energy prices.</p>
<p>We would appreciate feedback and suggestions from ASA
    members regarding the EIA home page and the Energy in Brief series to support
  public understanding of energy.</p>
<p><b><i>ASA Committee Recommendations and EIA Intentions for this presentation
  are presented based on the question/answer format of this advisory session.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Web Customer Survey Summary- ASA Advice and EIA Response</b></p>
<p><b>Advice:</b>&nbsp; Because the survey is presented to some
    customers more than once over the survey period, ask a question at the top
  “Have you taken the survey before?”</p>
<p><b>Response:</b>&nbsp; We don’t need that information
    specifically.&nbsp;&nbsp; The note to close the browser if they have taken the
    survey already needs to be very obvious and clear.&nbsp; That way we can be <span
class=GramE>more sure</span> to avoid getting multiple responses from any one
  user, although we don’t think that has been a problem in the past.</p>
<p><b>Advice:</b>&nbsp; The survey respondents are not a random
    sample.&nbsp; People who come to the website more frequently have a greater
    likelihood of getting the survey.&nbsp; The survey is sampling sessions, not
    visitors, so one class of users may be overrepresented.&nbsp; People who use
  bookmarks might not have even gotten the survey.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Response:</b>&nbsp; Yes, this is correct.&nbsp; For the
    2008 survey EIA placed the tags for the survey on every web page that had <span
class=GramE>a footer</span>, many, many more than the 25 tagged in the 2007
    survey.&nbsp; We know the 2008 survey reached many more people because we
    received over 5,600 responses in 2 weeks, versus about 5,000 responses in three
    weeks in 2007.&nbsp; Having the survey appear from many more pages, we are more
    likely to catch people coming to our site from Google or bookmarks.&nbsp; One
    ASA member said it’s not a scientific sample, but maybe that’s fine because we
  are not presenting it as such.</p>
<p><b>Advice:</b>&nbsp; Ask first-time visitors if they are
  likely to come back.</p>
<p><b>Response:</b>&nbsp; We included this question in our 2008
  survey conducted in July!</p>
<p><b>Advice:</b>&nbsp; Why do we always do the survey in the
  summer?&nbsp; Why not some other time of the year?</p>
<p><b>Response:</b>&nbsp; That’s just the time of year that works
    out best for us.&nbsp; Also, we get fewer crazy responses from school kids
  because they are on vacation.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Advice:</b>&nbsp; The survey gets feedback from people
    who come to the website but not from people who don’t.&nbsp; How do we know
    what they want?&nbsp; Maybe we should provide a tutorial or users guide for
  novice visitors.</p>
<p><b>Response:</b>&nbsp; We collect a limited amount of user
    feedback at conferences and from the people who talk to customers on our
    information hotline.&nbsp; We are working on consolidating and adding content
    in a new area of our site aimed at the general public.&nbsp; It would be more
  about energy education and an introduction to what information EIA has. </p>
<p><b>Advice:</b>&nbsp; Some people may actually want to take a
  longer survey.&nbsp; We should give an option for more questions.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Response:</b>&nbsp; This year we had follow-up questions
    for 4 of the 12 questions, drilling down for more information depending on
    their response to the original question.&nbsp; These additional questions made
    the survey a little longer, but the responses will provide more useful
  information and explanations for the answers.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Advice:</b>&nbsp; have some one-question surveys embedded
  in the site, like “was this information useful to you (yes/no).”</p>
<p><b>Response:</b>&nbsp; We are still hoping to do this.&nbsp; </p>
