                                                      (8:36 a.m.)

                       MR. BREIDT:  Good morning.  I

              think we're ready to get started.  First,

              I'd like to ask any committee member guest

              or EIA staff who was not here yesterday to

              introduce yourself at one of the

              microphones.  Is there anyone that falls in

              that category?  Everyone looks pretty

              familiar.

                       MS. HOBBS:  I'm Melinda Hobbs,

              Energy Information Administration.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Also if you didn't

              sign in yesterday there's a sign-in sheet

              out on the desk.  Lunch for the committee

              would be held at the conclusion of the

              session on suggestions for the Spring 2004

              agenda.  Lunch is where we had it

              yesterday.

                       One other thing is the committee

              members have in front of you a notice from

              the Federal Register on the Monthly Natural








              Gas Production Report.  Howard Gruenspecht

              wanted to get that to us so that's just for

              your information.  We won't be discussing

              that but you can take a look at it.

                       I'll now turn over to the agenda

              and the first talk of the morning is

              Improving EIA's Website, Creating a Vision

              for the Future, and that will be Colleen

              Blessing and Melinda Hobbs.

                       MS. BLESSING:  Good morning.  How

              are you guys?  This morning we're going to

              talk for a few minutes about EIA's website.

              Our presentation is going to be in two

              parts.  I'm going to talk for just a few

              minutes about the next steps that we're

              going to take in web development and then

              Melinda Hobbs is going to show you some

              recent improvements that we've made.

                       You guys have heard me talk before

              at ASA about EIA's website.  You know that

              we're very proud of our site.  We have

              100,000 pages, and we have a lot of users.








              Actually in March we hit a new record, 1.5

              unique user sessions, just for the month of

              March.  So we've been going 1, 1.2, 1.3, so

              we know we have a huge customer base out

              there.

                       You've probably heard us talk.

              We've won awards.  We have a lot of

              products that are very popular but.

              There's a but.  We get a lot of customer

              feedback and we know that there's still a

              lot of areas for improvement.  The last

              time that we redesigned our site was in

              2000, which in the web world is like 1820

              or something, so we figured that we needed

              to take another look, look at some options,

              and see where we might go in the future.

                       We've undertaken a project to take

              an objective look at our website, to step

              back and see where we are.  We have a

              contractor who's helping us.  What we're

              doing is a series of things.  The

              contractor has completed, actually,








              interviews with internal staff.  We did

              interviews with a total of 28 people in EIA

              and we're doing interviews with some groups

              in EIA, natural groups.  Now, those could

              be actually separate people, too, a web

              team and usability team.

                       And then the third group of people

              that have been interviewed are external

              customers.  Those are people on the Hill,

              the media, trade associations, and actually

              we didn't pick any academic people yet

              because we're hopeful that the feedback

              that we get from you will be considered the

              academic outlook on our website.  So we're

              hoping at the end that you guys will have

              some interesting comments about our

              website.

                       What we're going to do is create a

              matrix of the themes.  That's what the

              contractor's doing right now, create a

              matrix of the themes that we've heard.  The

              interviews were very open-ended.  Sometimes








              you can think of an interview as a scale of

              1 to 5 how satisfied are you.  We didn't do

              any of that.  We just said what works, what

              doesn't, and what would you improve.  Go.

                       And some people can go for an hour

              and a half, showing screens and explaining

              things that work and don't work, so it was

              very open-ended and I thought very

              productive.  A lot of people had a lot to

              say.  Without tipping the cards, the cards

              will probably be tipped at the next ASA

              meeting, there's a lot of agreement as to

              the good things and the areas where we need

              to improve.

                       The next step is we're going to

              hold a two-day workshop May 4th and May

              12th so they're coming up.  The contractor

              is also going to help us with the workshop.

              The people who are invited to the workshop

              are, according to the deputy

              administrators, the key web leaders in EIA,

              the key players.  This is not an








              educational workshop or a workshop for

              people to come and listen and learn.  I

              said to him yesterday we're emphasizing

              work and not shop.  It's going to be a

              working session.

                       The contractor is going to present

              what the internal people said, what the

              external people said, the intersections and

              the differences, and then we're going to

              try to take a look, I think, at three basic

              areas, the user interface navigation, if

              it's easy to find what they're looking for

              or not so easy to find, how the site is

              managed.  Right now it's managed loosely by

              a committee and if there are suggested

              changes to maybe tighten that up.

                       Also the deputy yesterday was

              talking about maybe we'd be looking at

              low-hanging fruit and there are some

              low-hanging fruit things that I think we

              can have improvements on but there is also

              what I would call some high-hanging fruit,








              which might be things like content

              management systems or databases, things

              that are more of a reach for us that we

              might want to take a look at or maybe at

              least put on the priority list or the

              options list to see if we want to take a

              look at.

                       We've agreed with the contractor

              that at this workshop we are not

              redesigning the page.  We are not actually

              voting on anything.  We're just coming up

              with options and I think prioritizing them.

              And then those will be presented to the

              powers that be to make some decisions about

              where we're going to go in the future.

                       You know that there is a plan in

              place and it's coming fairly quickly to

              move ahead with some minor and major

              changes.  We haven't actually not been

              doing anything over the last year or two.

              Melinda Hobbs and others have been doing a

              lot of improvements and we're very proud of








              some of these and so we wanted to show them

              to you.  Then after Melinda's done there's

              going to be about 15 minutes for you to

              comment on our site and we'll be furiously

              writing those things down and sending those

              to the contractor as input from the ASA

              Committee.  Thanks.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Now I get to show you

              some of the good things that we have been

              doing.  Some of the recent improvements

              that we've made, we have standards.  We

              have a whole list of standards of what we

              want everybody to do when they put out a

              page.  We want them to have a logo.  We

              want them to have bread crumbs.  Bread

              crumbs are things that allow people to get

              back and forth between where you're at and

              where you were at, and, importantly, the

              dates of the data.  A lot of the

              publications, tables and stuff that we have

              out there, didn't have the date that this

              was collected, the date it was published,








              and what's the next time it was coming out.

                       We had a site audit in 2000 and

              we're going to have another one this year

              to see if people are going with the

              standards, and what parts are not working.

              We've solicited feedback from the staff.

              We sent out EIA-wide three questions, what

              do you think is working, what do you think

              is not working, and how can we improve it.

              We've got a lot of good feedback so we're

              real pleased with that.  That was in

              addition to a lot of the interviews that

              we've done.

                       We've worked on transitioning from

              paper reports to web reports.  We've done

              writing for the web.  We've had classes on

              teaching a lot of the authors how to write

              better for the web and stuff like that and

              improve the user interface.

                       Here's one of the publications

              that we had out there.  This was last

              year's Annual Energy Outlook.  While it was








              much better than it was the year before

              because people couldn't really find the

              tables still on this left sidebar it's a

              jumble of information.  You don't really

              know that this is part of a publication.

                       The after of the Annual Energy

              Outlook, this year's that just went out,

              has more of a publication feel.  You can

              tell right here's the publication and

              here's your table of contents that are in

              the publication.  The tables are still

              right on top so people can find them pretty

              easily.  If we go to the site we can

              actually see a little bit better what's

              going on.  We broke down the table of

              contents for the publication and then you

              have all the related links that were all

              jumbled on that left sidebar.  You have it

              all split out so it's much easier to read.

                       Another thing that people really

              liked was if you go to one of the pages,

              say, the electricity page, all the graphs








              and stuff now have the figure data right

              here so people don't have to call.  There

              was a lot of calls about what's the data

              behind this figure.  That was a good thing

              and everybody really had some good comments

              on that.

                       This is a before shot of the

              country analysis briefs.  I'm trying to

              give you an overview of publication.  This

              is like a subsite, one of the places on the

              EIA site.  This is the country analysis

              briefs.  The focal point of the page is the

              maps and people really weren't seeing what

              was on the left and right sidebars so we

              wanted to get rid of that.

                       This is the after.  A lot of

              people weren't really geography oriented.

              This way you can see what's underneath some

              of the regions a little bit easier and they

              can see what CABs, country analysis briefs,

              are available for what regions in the site.

                       Also on the previous version of








              the country analysis briefs underneath here

              there was another drop down that contained

              all this information.  One of the big

              things, which was under this big list of

              stuff, was the OPEC brief.  A lot of times

              it's one of the most requested things they

              get on the site.  So we wanted to bring

              that and organize it a little bit better.

                       This is an all new layout.  This

              is a data layout.  They have all their

              natural gas data in different publications

              so they wanted to bring it all together and

              make a layout where they could see

              everything natural gas.  So all these

              things are all natural gas related and it's

              all the data they collect.  Everything is

              right here.

                       I can go to the site and you can

              see if you go to different places they have

              all these different things.  It's more of a

              database feel instead of publication feel

              to the data.  One of the other nice things








              they have is the series.  You can see how

              far back all the series go.  You can click

              on it and get a complete XL version of

              everything.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  If I wanted one

              of the series do I need to click on each

              one of those on the link?

                       MS. HOBBS:  Yes.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  It would be nice

              to have a little check box, I want this and

              that one and that one and check them and

              then you download it in one file.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Make a note of that.

                       This is data and information,

              another layout that we have.  A lot of the

              publications, even the data publications,

              have a lot of information behind them.  Let

              me go to this and then to renewables.  If

              you came into geothermal heat pumps and you

              clicked on this you got this page.  When

              you clicked on geothermal heat pumps you

              came into a piece of a publication.  I








              mean, when you clicked on geothermal heat

              pumps you come in and say geothermal

              shipments.  Is this really what I wanted?

              Is this what I was after?  And on this side

              chapter 1, chapter 2, is that real

              descriptive?  So the after version of this

              is much better.

                       You come in and you click on

              geothermal heat pumps and you get a title

              that says geothermal heat pumps.  When you

              click on something you really want to get

              what you thought you were getting.  And if

              you scroll down here you get a good

              description of what geothermal heat pumps

              is, a nice little picture of what it is,

              and then you get more information that you

              may want about geothermal heat pumps, and

              here are the shipments from the Form EI.

              So it was much more descriptive and it's

              laid out much better and you get the

              information that you wanted.  It's not a

              high tech thing but it's just laid out








              well, organized, and it's visually exactly

              what you want to see.

                       We want to get your comments.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  What you were just

              mentioning what the other chapters have

              been when you're dragging the mouse on the

              chapters you can easily make the chapter

              heading pop.

                       MS. HOBBS:  You could or you could

              just have the chapter heading there instead

              of having chapter 1.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  If you want to 컴컴

              just show it up only when the mouse is

              dragging on it.

                       DR. FEDER:  If I go into Google

              and type the words "energy" and

              "statistics" how likely am I to get to

              this?

                       MS. HOBBS:  That's the site.

              You're going to have to do that.  I don't

              know about statistics.  I know energy

              information you'll get us.








                       DR. SITTER:  컴컴 have to do with

              where you're coming from 컴컴 coming from

              here.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Well, we're number

              one.

                       DR. SITTER:  But you're hooking to

              the web in Washington, D.C.

                       MS. HOBBS:  It doesn't matter.

                       DR. SITTER:  Oh, no, it does.  It

              matters.  If I go in Canada it's not as

              likely 컴컴

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  I assume you have

              no choice in the matter, speaking of

              Google.  I assume you don't have a choice

              on the search engine.

                       MS. HOBBS:  That will be something

              we'll have to take into consideration if

              you want to make that suggestion.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  The first search

              engine is absolutely 컴컴 no matter which

              agency you go to the search engine is just

              bad.  You look for something and it gives








              you totally irrelevant stuff and it's not

              your fault.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Well, it is our fault

              as well because a lot of our pages don't

              have the correct keywords.  I mean, we do

              have a lot of improvements we need to make

              as well but we've got a lot of those

              comments, get rid of the search engine.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  When you were

              going through the AEO the graphs are now up

              with the text as opposed to having to click

              on them every time you want to see the

              graph with the text.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Can you go back to the

              AEO?

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  Sorry, I walked in

              late.

                       MS. HOBBS:  That's fine.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  It always bothered

              the hell of me.  Every time you're reading

              through it, go to figure 1, go to figure 2.

              Well, can I just see it while I'm looking








              at it?

                       MS. HOBBS:  See, the graphs are

              right with the text now and you can

              actually get the data behind the figures.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  But I think what

              Mark is saying is the opposite.  If you go

              to a data table, click on it, and the graph

              comes up.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  No, that's not

              what I was saying at all.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  But that's what

              I'm saying is that that would be cool too.

              If you go to a data table and you click on

              it and if --

                       MS. HOBBS:  Here's a data table in

              here.  You can get a printer-friendly

              version of it if you'd like.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Some tables lend

              themselves, some don't.

                       MS. HOBBS:  You want to click on

              this and be able to graph that table?

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  I mean, before








              you have a time series.  I want to click on

              it and have the option to either download

              it or see the time series.

                       MS. HOBBS:  We're working on

              something like that.  It's not quite ready.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  And I'd like even

              to be able to overlay several time series

              on the same thing.  It's thinking like

              stock process.  I want to see the Dow Jones

              and I want to see Microsoft.  That would be

              cool.  I'm not sure how useful but cool.

                       MS. KHANNA:  Sometimes I want to

              actually just pick out the graph because I

              want to make a transparency out of it,

              let's say, for my class.  This format, that

              would be very hard to do.  You'd have to go

              to a data table and then 컴컴

                       MS. HOBBS:  You can click on it

              and you can get the graph.

                       MS. KHANNA:  Excellent, thank you.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Sure.

                       MS. KHANNA:  The other question I








              had was as a user of publications I'm often

              looking for the technical appendix, how was

              something defined, how was it calculated.

              That was not obvious on your site.

                       MS. HOBBS:  It's right on the

              bottom.  The appendices are right here.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Somewhere up on the

              right it said "detailed assumptions."

                       MS. HOBBS:  Yes, that's a

              supporting document.  That's the supporting

              assumption for the entire AEO.  Those were

              the appendices for just that.

                       DR. BURTON:  I have always enjoyed

              the EIA website.  I've always found it to

              be one of the more productive federal sites

              that I've used.  You guys have taken

              something that was good and made it even

              better.  But the problem is when you do

              that it's like no good deed goes

              unpunished.  Now I want more.

                       You showed it had all of the

              natural gas information in one place.  I








              don't use documents nearly as much as I use

              data.  So being able to gather data from

              disparate sources, have them in one place,

              being able to have someone combine,

              basically when you do something like that

              you save me a great deal of work and that

              makes me happy.  So the more that you're

              able to pull disparate data sources

              together into a single place the more

              useful the site is to me.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Good, we'll try and do

              more of that.

                       Any more?

                       MS. BLESSING:  Anything else about

              any parts of the site, the navigation?

                       MS. KHANNA:  I haven't looked at

              your site in the last month or so so I'm a

              little bit outdated but it used to be that

              you didn't have long time series on certain

              variables, for example, crude imports and

              exports.  You went up only to the last 10

              years whereas I know that the data exist








              going back to the early '70s and even

              before in some cases if you're talking

              about what's in the US.  If you're going to

              the international site I used to find that

              very frustrating because I knew it was

              there in print because I have the old EIA

              reports but it's not there on the web.

                       I realize why.  They were printed

              before the web was existing.

                       MS. BLESSING:  They may not be

              available.

                       MS. KHANNA:  And so it's a

              question of someone is going to have to key

              in those data, probably.  That would be

              really nice.  No, grad students are not

              going to be willing to key in data for me.

              They don't do that.  That's not what they

              do any more.  With scanning the 2s become

              3s.  I mean, this is small print.

                       DR. BURTON:  Scanning with

              alphabets is fine but with numbers you have

              to go back and verify it.








                       MS. HOBBS:  Thank you very much.

                       MS. FEDER:  Can we ask one

              question?  Is this a general trend to have

              more and more on the web and less and less

              in print?

                       MS. HOBBS:  Yes.  We've only got a

              couple of publications like the Annual

              Energy Outlook that are supposed to stay in

              print.

                       DR. FEDER:  If people write an

              academic paper and they need to reference

              this what guarantee do they have that the

              same publication exists or might be

              superseded by a revision and then you have

              a problem because you are citing something

              and now you're proven wrong because this

              has been changed or whatever?

                       There's a little bit of a problem.

              I don't use energy statistics much but if I

              write see such and such downloaded this

              date and it's not there so I think there

              needs to be some kind of archive so people








              who cite those things will not be in error.

              I hope I'm saying this right.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Most of our

              publications are archived so you can go

              back.

                       DR. FEDER:  I can get reference?

                       MS. HOBBS:  Yes, but the data is

              not.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  So you don't

              freeze the data every six months like in

              the software?  Software evolves, they

              freeze it, and then that's it for the next

              sixth months.  It stays the same.

                       MS. BLESSING:  That feeds in to

              the next breakout session, revising data.

              There's a question that we're asking for

              your input on.

                       DR. FEDER:  That raises an issue

              that if somebody makes some inference based

              on data that would not be available how can

              you validate 컴컴 might go back and say

              wait a minute, Professor Khanna, you're








              wrong.

                       MS. KHANNA:  Actually, that

              happens a lot, I know, with EIA data.

              They're always dynamically updating it.

              And it's been a real issue where somebody

              uses the data set in a published work and

              it's not in the data bank with the journal.

              They just say it's available on the web;

              just go there.  By then six months later

              the data are different and you cannot

              replicate it.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  There's always

              updating data, for example, and that

              happens all the time in every field when

              you're using some real time data and you're

              doing something and three months later they

              revise the statistics.

                       MS. KHANNA:  No, there's a slight

              difference.  If it was in print I could see

              what the revision was.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  But they're not

              printing them either.








                       DR. HENGARTNER:  That's a problem

              there too?

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  It's happening all

              over.  The academic reference situation is

              going to change with it.  I mean, basically

              it already has.  If you look at some of the

              academic journals now have changed their

              bibliography requirements and now you can

              use websites.  You just have to have the

              date in there and it's okay if it changes.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  I think one of the

              best recommendations is you download a copy

              and keep it with you 컴컴 but I do have a

              specific question.  When you discontinue

              printing a particular document do you keep

              a PDF or something that would have been

              printed?

                       MS. BLESSING:  Yes.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  If I send an e-mail

              saying can you please send me that

              particular version so you have a unique

              document 컴컴








                       DR. BURTON:  Another related

              issue, a lot of times in the case of the

              data, not so much the publications or

              figures within, it's really hard to figure

              out exactly how to cite it.  You have a

              data table that will be coal prices by

              region.  How do I cite that?  I'm sure that

              that's what's part of something else and

              it's just coming out as a data table but I

              need a specific way to cite it so that

              somebody else that wants to come back I

              can't just give them the web address.  I

              need to give them a more tangible source

              컴컴 and sometimes that's a problem.

                       MS. BLESSING:  You were saying

              컴컴 going away from the publications and

              you like the natural gas navigator look

              where it's more of a data presentation but

              then that leads into your problem of not

              having a publication to cite because all

              you've got is a web page.

                       DR. BURTON:  I don't necessarily








              need a publication.  I just need something

              more substantial than the website,

              something that says these data represent

              data collected by EIA Form whatever, just

              something that I can attribute these data

              to.  It doesn't have to be a publication

              but something I can --

                       MS. HOBBS:  And that's another

              problem, though, because a lot of that data

              is collected from different sources.  It

              comes in at different times.  It's revised

              at different times.  Each cell would have

              to have little notations in it.

                       MS. BLESSING:  I know the

              navigator people are working really hard

              because they said there are different

              levels of data and some of it's state, some

              of it is national and regional, and some of

              it's quarterly so when you pull it in it

              might be coming from different sources.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Are you saying

              you have data on your web page that's not








              EIA collected?

                       MS. BLESSING:  No.

                       DR. BURTON:  It's from a bunch of

              different sources.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Different surveys.

                       MS. BLESSING:  I'm sorry,

              different surveys so there might be a

              weekly survey and a monthly survey and an

              annual survey.

                       MS. FORSYTH:  You were talking

              earlier about setting standards for

              individual pages and maybe one of the

              standards that you could include is a

              suggested citation so that you could have

              like a standard across EIA of how

              individual pages could be referred to or at

              least let the areas developing the pages

              develop the citation as well.

                       MS. BLESSING:  That's a good

              suggestion.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Yes.

                       DR. SITTER:  And those should be








              attached to your archiving; that is, when

              you make a reference to a page if you come

              to EIA and say I want this one it actually

              refers back to that archived page, not an

              updated version of that page.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  It goes back to

              freezing it once a month.

                       DR. SITTER:  That's right.

                       MS. SEREIKA:  Couldn't also just

              part of the name of the page be the date

              that it was created?

                       MS. HOBBS:  No, because we like to

              keep the same page name.  If somebody

              bookmarks that page and it's revised next

              week, I mean, they're lost.

                       DR. SITTER:  Nick wants to say

              something.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  According to the

              agreement between 컴컴 we need a frozen

              version, say, once a month that's archived,

              maybe downloaded as a CD ISO image.  I

              mean, really make a CD, why not?  I mean,








              you could just download that on a CD and

              people can download the whole CD and here

              it is.  And you can navigate your CD

              offline.

                       DR. FEDER:  I mean, it needs to be

              something that can be referenced.  If it's

              a moving target that could change any time,

              any day then I recognize it should be some

              dynamic form, too, but for the purpose of

              citation and referencing you need something

              that's more stable.  So a compromise would

              be what 컴컴 and the suggestion is to

              freeze it or maybe have two versions and

              one can be a reference 컴컴 most

              publications require a source and the

              source has to be --

                       DR. BURTON:  We realize that we're

              setting the bar extraordinarily high but we

              got invited to do that.  For somebody who's

              organizationally challenged slightly, I

              wouldn't want to get anywhere near this.

                       DR. SITTER:  But it's a real








              problem.  In many of the statistics

              journals they won't let you refer to a web

              page.  They just won't because they know

              how unstable they are.  It's just 9not an

              option.  So if the only place I can get at

              that is on the web page, I can't use it.  I

              can't refer to it.

                       I know some agencies almost like

              put 10 publications that on their web pages

              and everybody knows they are but the

              citation looks legit 컴컴 it's a problem if

              all you've got is the website.

                       MS. HOBBS:  Do you have an example

              of one of those?

                       DR. BURTON:  I'll find one.  I'll

              find one and e-mail it to you.

                       MS. BLESSING:  I was also

              wondering if maybe one of you guys could

              come up with an idea.  You said maybe we

              should have a standard.  But what would

              that look like to you?  What elements would

              it have in it?








                       DR. HENGARTNER:  You freeze it,

              you have a CD.

                       MS. BLESSING:  But that still

              wouldn't have the sites at the bottom.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  You can cite the

              CD.  You cite the CD and then the table

              number and the date.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  Perhaps you should

              just go ask the statistics journal what

              they would like you to do.

                       DR. BURTON:  The SEC does a very

              good job with their data in this regard.

              It's not any better in any other regard but

              in the process of making it citable the SEC

              stuff tends to be the easiest to work with.

              I'll find some examples on that.

                       In the SEC data stuff there's

              something called state link that contains a

              huge number of data sets.  I think if you

              guys look at those it will give you some

              sense of maybe a different way to make

              these things citable.








                       MS. BLESSING:  You said state --

                       DR. BURTON:  State link.  And they

              hide it.  It's almost impossible to find.

                       MS. BLESSING:  Another challenge

              so don't do what they do.

                       MS. KHANNA:  When you integrate

              things into a database format like you did

              for the natural gas page why not give it a

              name?  This is the natural gas database or

              something like that of the EIA and then you

              can cite that as a database, download it

              and also the date you downloaded it on.

                       DR. FEDER:  You can also use

              volume and issue number so every month you

              have a new issue number 컴컴 ISO image?

                       MS. BLESSING:  It's not every

              month because Natural Gas Navigator stuff

              is coming in.  I mean, their data tables

              are changing daily.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  But what I'm

              thinking is you just freeze it every so

              often.  It's like software gets updated








              continuously but ever so often the stuff

              gets frozen and says this is the state of

              the art as of today and if you need the

              reference in a month come back in a month.

                       DR. BURTON:  Even quarterly would

              probably 컴컴 you're still going to have

              monthly series.  Locking it down once a

              quarter as opposed to once a month is a lot

              of work.

                       DR. SITTER:  For most

              methodological publications you want the

              data sets.  It's not important that it be

              today's.  It can be three months ago.

              That's fine.  But the point is if you say

              that when you do this to this data set this

              is what you get somebody else wants to go

              and see if you're right if you make a

              mistake so they can play with it and try

              other things on the same data set.  But if

              the data set has changed they can't even

              repeat what you did.  How can they then

              compare what you did to something else?








                       MS. BLESSING:  I like that.

              That's good 컴컴 usability is what makes it

              컴컴

                       DR. FEDER:  People who download

              컴컴 I had a 컴컴 with JBS.  They give you

              a password in the site when you submit a

              paper to put the data set that you used in

              the website.  Do you have any objection to

              people using it?  Do you give people

              permission to upload the data that they

              downloaded from you?  Is there any

              copyright or intellectual property issue?

                       MS. HOBBS:  I don't think so.

                       DR. FEDER:  It has to be stated

              because otherwise we will be in violation

              of your rights.

                       MS. BLESSING:  No, we have no

              copyrights.  I think what we do is we ask

              that people cite us.

                       DR. FEDER:  You have to anyway.

                       MS. BLESSING:  But some people

              write us and say can I use your stuff and








              we say yes.  Actually that policy is hidden

              on our website but yes, it does say you can

              use everything; you just attribute it to

              us.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Were there any other

              comments?

                       DR. SITTER:  Are we behind

              schedule now?

                       MR. BREIDT:  So we can now move to

              the breakout sessions.  Going downstairs to

              the survey quality assessments of EIA will

              be Nick, Barb, Mark Bernstein, Neha, and

              Susan.  Everybody else stay here.

                            (Recess)

                       MR. BREIDT:  Are you ready?

                       MS. MILLER:  Good morning.  I'm

              Rene Miller and Alethea Jennings is here

              with me today.  We're both glad to be here

              to talk with you and to share with you our

              challenge on revising our data together

              across the agency.  I was going to start by

              telling you what we mean by this and why








              it's important but you've already expressed

              some ideas on this.

                       From our points of view one of the

              reasons that it has become important is

              that we have more of what we call data

              dependencies.  What I mean by this is

              offices are using more data from other

              offices in their publications.  I'm using

              the term "publications" rather loosely.

              These aren't necessarily hard copy

              publications.  They can be publications on

              the web.

                       Not too long ago Bob Schnapp and

              I, for example, told you about how we're

              now obtaining data for the electric power

              sector from electric power surveys and

              these data are being used in natural gas

              publications, in coal publications, in

              renewable publications, in our integrated

              statistics publications, as well as the

              electric power publications.  So you can

              see how a change to electric power data








              could affect many different areas and in

              fact that's what happens.  We had a change

              to our data on natural gas consumed by the

              electric power sector and it was picked up

              in an electric power publication but not in

              a natural gas publication because they had

              a different processing cycle.

                       Now, we're not talking about a big

              change here.  We're talking about the last

              digit but nevertheless this made us think

              well, maybe we can do a better job in

              coordination.  We were concerned because

              with the web users are more easily able to

              obtain data from different publications and

              notice if they don't match and, as you've

              pointed out, this could cause some

              confusion.  So by revising together what we

              are talking about is the coordination that

              would enable revisions made to a data

              series to appear wherever that series is

              published to avoid this type of confusion.

                       I'm going to start by telling you








              about our current revision standard, which

              was initially developed before we had as

              many data dependencies as we currently do.

              In fact an earlier generation of this

              committee in the 1980s provided us with

              input that led to the developments of the

              standard.  I remember this pretty well

              because my very first presentation to the

              committee was on revisions.  So I'm going

              to tell you a little about our current

              standard and then I'll go on to tell you

              about some of the discussions that we've

              had on coordinating revisions.

                       These are discussions that our

              interoffice issues group has had.  Some

              people from the group are here.  We have

              Roy Kass, for instance, sitting in Johnny

              Blair's seat, and Susan Holt is in the

              back.  I'm going to tell you about an

              opportunity for interoffice coordination

              that we found concerning revising final

              data and what our next steps are.  And then








              Alethea is going to talk with you about

              issues pertaining to revisions before the

              data become final and she'll show you an

              example of her revision trail.  She's going

              to show you some actual data that will give

              you an idea of some of the challenges that

              we face.

                       Then an issue that comes up every

              time we talk about revisions is can't we

              make better use of the web and you've

              touched upon some of these issues.  The

              issue that has come up is can't we show the

              latest data someplace on the web and

              possibly still have our official statistics

              someplace else.  Alethea will get into that

              and then she'll end with our questions for

              you.

                       So to start with our current

              revision standard, our standard currently

              says that we should establish a schedule

              for our anticipated revisions, make it

              available to users, and that we shouldn't








              plan for more than two revisions of the

              same survey data cell.  But it does allow

              for additional revisions if we find some

              errors that we think need to be corrected

              and these could be based on what we call

              threshold criteria developed ahead of time.

                       For example, an office could

              decide well, if as a result of a revision

              the national level data will change by 1

              percent we'll go ahead and make that

              revision.  That's a big enough change to

              make.  The standard also will ask for

              revisions at the discretion of the

              sponsoring office director.  So you can see

              there is a fair amount of leeway.  This

              standard was basically addressing data

              before they were declared final so it

              didn't really address modifications to

              final data.

                       In our discussions about what we

              could do about better coordinating we

              talked about both scheduling revisions and








              limiting the number of revisions.  What's

              happening now is that we're each focusing

              on different aspects of the standard.  I

              think that's the best way of putting it.

              For example, for our monthly data in the

              petroleum supply and marketing area they

              schedule their revisions.  They both

              publish a preliminary estimate based on the

              survey data.  They're revised the following

              month and then they hold their revisions

              until the end of the reporting cycle.

                       They both publish estimates prior

              to publishing their survey data.  In

              petroleum supply the estimates are based on

              weekly data for selected categories and

              Ruey-Pyng told you a little about that

              yesterday.  In petroleum marketing they

              publish a forecast prior to publishing

              their survey data.  This was something that

              wasn't really done that we initially

              developed our standard using a forecast

              before publishing survey data so we didn't








              address it.

                       In the natural gas area they rely

              mainly on threshold criteria to make their

              revisions and electric power does something

              in between.  The policy is to publish a

              preliminary monthly estimate and they're

              not revised until the end of the reporting

              year unless there are large errors.  Back

              in the days that the electric utilities

              were our only respondents there weren't

              large errors; we didn't have many

              revisions.  Now that we have other players

              and there are more complications due to the

              restructuring of the industry we do have

              more revisions in that area.

                       We found out about what other

              agencies are doing for their monthly

              establishment surveys.  We contacted Bureau

              of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau

              and we found, for example, that for the

              current employment survey they schedule

              their revisions and they publish a








              preliminary estimate.  Then they're revised

              again the following month and then hold

              their revisions until the end of the

              reporting cycle.

                       We found the Census does something

              similar.  They have additional revisions,

              though, to benchmark to their annual survey

              and also to the economic census.  So both

              of these agencies schedule their revisions

              but they have more revisions than our

              current standard allows for.

                       In our group discussions we

              couldn't come to consensus on scheduling

              revisions or limiting the number of

              versions of the number we should publish.

              We thought our situation, actually, was

              different from Census in that we can

              publish facility-level data and in some

              situations we do whereas they can't and our

              concern was well, if there were errors at

              the respondent level and a respondent

              resubmitted data and we didn't show the








              corrections that it would be noticed and

              this would be pointed at us and we didn't

              think that we could not do this.

                       An area that we did think would be

              worthwhile having more coordination on,

              though, was revising data that had been

              declared final.  And we thought in this

              situation if somebody wanted to reopen the

              data and make a revision they really needed

              to make a case for it and that we should

              all be together on whether we would make

              the change because, after all, these are

              EIA's final data.

                       So what we did is we came up with

              a scheme.  I think you have a little flow

              chart on the scheme that we came up with.

              It's really not complicated.  The basic

              philosophy is that revisions will no longer

              be made in isolation.  If an office finds a

              change that must be made other offices must

              be notified and agree on the pending

              change.  If there is disagreement then








              we'll talk about it in our interoffice

              issues group.

                       So our next step is going to be to

              issue the policy on revising "final data"

              and to update our revision standard to

              reflect the change that we're no longer

              making revisions in isolation.  But now we

              have a whole other area to address and that

              is the situation before the data become

              final.  And now I'll turn it over to

              Alethea to show you an example of some of

              the challenges we have there and to ask for

              your help.  Thank you.

                       MS. JENNINGS:  To illustrate some

              of the concerns that we have with

              publishing revised data across EIA we're

              going to take a look at an example of a

              revision trail.  When we selected a data

              series that we believe demonstrates our

              need from time to time to revise data

              frequently that series is, of course,

              natural gas delivered to residential








              consumers.  We often refer to this in EIA

              also as natural gas consumption in the

              residential sector.

                       The reporting period that we're

              going to look very closely at is the month

              of January 2002.  The data are taken from

              the natural gas monthly publications from

              April 2002 through January 2004 and this

              will allow us to look at the revision trail

              over a span of 22 months.

                       What you see here is a portion of

              Table C-1 that was included in the paper

              that was on the website and this shows

              natural gas deliveries at the national

              level for each monthly reporting period in

              the year 2002.  Now, you'll note that for

              each reporting period the data actually

              revised several times within the first few

              months of publication.

                       We're going to take a closer look

              at our selected period of January 2002.

              Looking closely at this, you'll notice that








              the data revised each month for the first

              six months following the initial date of

              publication.  Typically data for the month

              of January is actually revised more often

              than other months because it's during this

              time that new respondents are added and

              they have not yet been trained.  It does

              take time to train new respondents and also

              to resolve any existing response issues at

              that time.

                       But it is important to note that

              for any reporting period the data could

              revise for a number of reasons.  For

              example, there could be late submissions by

              respondents.  EIA could find errors and

              have a desire to correct them as we

              normally do.  And then also respondents

              often resubmit data.  In addition to that

              the monthly data are also benchmarked to

              the annual data when they become available

              and this causes revisions as well.

                       This is a portion of Table C-2








              that was included with the paper on the

              website.  This table demonstrates the

              impact of state-level data on national

              level totals.  The table shows, of course,

              the publication date, the state for which

              the data were revised, the initial data

              published in the previous publication, the

              publication that came out before, and the

              revised number, and then we've included a

              percent change column.  This column

              highlights the change in total volume by

              percentage, total volume for that state.

              That's what that represents.

                       To specify some of the challenges

              that we face in looking at the state data,

              first, there are some revisions that

              actually amount to 10 or more percent of

              the total volume for that state.  We

              believe that the users of state data would

              actually consider this to be significant so

              we would definitely want to publish that.

              As I mentioned earlier, revisions occur for








              a number of different reasons.  In some

              instances, as you'll note for the May 2002

              publication for the State of Washington, an

              NA is being replaced by actual reported

              data.  The NA stands for not available.

              And there are other times, of course, when

              respondents resubmit and then when we are

              correcting errors you will see the

              revisions as well.

                       Now, often when there's a

              significant change in the state level data

              it does not affect the national total.

              This is sometimes the result of NAs being

              replaced by actually reported data.  For

              this particular data series an NA is

              published when the data reported at the

              state level falls below a predetermined

              percentage of the total volume for that

              state.  Then when EIA has received enough

              data to meet the requirement for publishing

              the NAs are lifted, and they are replaced

              by the actual reported data.  The NAs








              actually represent imputed data that are

              not shown on the table but they are

              calculated as a part of the national total.

              And the total often will not change when

              the imputed values closely match the data

              reported.

                       But when there is a change at the

              state level that does affect the national

              total it is our current practice to publish

              that revised number and that's what we do.

              Keeping in mind that we're exploring the

              possibility of limiting revisions, we

              realize it may be necessary for us to

              reconsider this practice.

                       I'm going to ask you to take a

              look at Table 15 that's in the handout that

              you have before you.  Table 15 is an

              example of what state data users will see

              when there are changes in the state-level

              data.  This table shows natural gas

              deliveries to residential consumers at the

              state level.








                       The first column shows data for

              January 2002.  You'll notice that there are

              two revisions noted there, one for the

              State of Idaho, and the other for the State

              of Nevada.  These revisions actually do

              impact the national total so, of course, we

              have published that total value, the

              revised number, at the bottom; however,

              given that there are remaining NAs on that

              table the sum of the components does not

              equal the total.

                       Now, in considering this if we opt

              to limit revisions we realize that we could

              consider not revising the total number

              until all of the NAs have been lifted.  EIA

              is considering whether this is really an

              acceptable practice so as you respond to

              our questions at the end of this session

              we'd like your feedback regarding whether

              it's ever considered acceptable to publish

              data where the components do not sum to the

              total.








                       In addition to thinking about the

              coordination of revisions and all of the

              discussion that's taken place regarding our

              current revisions policy it's been

              suggested and it was discussed earlier this

              morning that we ought to make better use of

              the website by publishing the latest data

              available to our users on the EIA website.

              This is based, of course, on the premise

              that it would benefit our users to have the

              latest data available to them at all times.

                       Now, there are advantages and

              disadvantages, of course, to adopting this

              practice.  The advantages are that, of

              course, errors would be corrected as soon

              as possible and that our users would have

              the latest data available to them so EIA

              wouldn't have to scramble to produce it

              when a request comes in.  I do want to

              point out, also, that a number of users

              believe that if an error is found it should

              be corrected and published as soon as








              possible.

                       But let's think about the

              disadvantages.  First of all, maintaining

              the site could place an added burden on EIA

              staff members.  And then, of course, in

              addition to that there are different

              vintages of the data which could cause

              confusion by the users.  By that I mean

              that there are sometimes different levels

              of aggregation between versions so a user

              may see a different version than is

              actually published in a hard copy or on the

              web.  And, of course, the latest may not

              actually be the greatest.  We'll move to

              the next slide and I'll explain what I mean

              by that.  Is the latest really the

              greatest?

                       The data here that you see in

              Table D-1 are taken from the Monthly Energy

              Review, which, incidentally, is a

              multi-source publication which speaks

              directly to what Colleen and Melinda were








              talking about earlier.  The data are

              actually collected within various program

              offices across EIA and then the data are

              submitted to the office that publishes or

              produces the Monthly Energy Review.

                       Table D-1 shows us natural gas

              prices in the electric power sector for

              each monthly reporting period in the year

              2002.  Now, this is a very good example of

              a data series where the data have a

              tendency to fluctuate and often it revises

              back to previously published values.  If

              you'll look at the month of January the

              published number for April 2003 was the

              same as what it was revised to in July 2003

              and then again in November 2003.  Although

              this series is a fairly new series and

              probably revises more often than most it

              does demonstrate how we can revise

              frequently and then end up back where we

              started.

                       Given the challenges that we've








              presented as they relate to our current

              revisions practices and our policy and our

              concerns with wanting to provide the latest

              data available to our users we have a few

              questions that we'd like you to answer for

              us.

                       First, when EIA developed its

              revision standard it was back in the early

              '80s and at that time our main concern was

              our credibility and we thought it was a

              good idea to limit revisions.  We're

              wondering whether this is still a good

              assumption.

                       Now, there's been a lot of

              discussion about this and we've had

              different comments.  We've heard that,

              given the widespread use of spreadsheets,

              there are many users who really don't mind

              the revisions because they simply plug in a

              new number and recalculate.  They don't

              find that it's a big issue for them to deal

              with.  The other side of this is that these








              very same users often don't like to see

              breaks in the data series.

                       Also there are those who publish

              but they produce the publications and

              they've shared with us that it's been

              pointed out that revisions are not exactly

              a costless effort.  This is because there's

              often a ripple effect within the data and

              this is due to data dependencies.  So when

              we revise the data it's important that we

              are certain that we clearly understand

              what's going to happen to the other data

              series that could be affected by any change

              that we make.

                       We are wondering whether it's

              still a good assumption to limit revisions.

              And then regarding the natural gas data for

              the residential customers we'd like your

              suggestions for another approach, maybe a

              better approach, for presenting these

              revisions.  Referencing our example of

              Table 15, would it ever be an acceptable








              practice to publish data where the

              components do not sum to the total?  And

              then finally we'd like your thoughts about

              showing the latest and what we believe may

              be the greatest data on the web.

                       DR. FEDER:  You talked about how

              sometimes components don't add up to the

              sum.  A somewhat related issue is measure

              of change is not always best described by

              comparing the best two estimates 컴컴 for

              instance so that's another issue.

              Sometimes our best estimates in terms of

              statistical methodology for change is not

              the difference between two estimates

              because of correlations and other issues.

                       I know that in Statistics Canada

              and the BLS, more about labor statistics,

              the practice is to use benchmarking when

              you are attempting to make the components

              add up to the sum and that's actually based

              on certain theory that shows that smaller

              estimates are improved by benchmarking to








              the total.  Now, again, I say I don't want

              to comment on policy but I just feel as a

              user I would like to see the best data

              there is and revisions are okay.

                       One final comment, we all know

              from election nights that sometimes the

              first estimate as soon as the polls close

              is 컴컴 and we see some fluctuation during

              the night and in the end we come back to

              this.  Now, still we know that the standard

              error is proportional to one over the

              square root of the sample size, which

              means, simplified here, the more data you

              have the better your estimate is.

                       So my inclination is to say the

              latest is the best in terms of 컴컴 error.

              Now, sometimes you're proven wrong.

              Sometimes the sample size gives you the

              most accurate estimate by the lack of the

              draw but you don't know that.  So, again,

              as a user I would like to see the latest

              information and the most up to date.  How








              often can you revise it?  You said it's not

              a costless effort.  That's a policy issue.

                       But you don't publish estimates of

              change, do you?

                       MS. JENNINGS:  Absolutely.  Okay,

              thank you.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  I would like to ask

              you a couple of questions.  First of all,

              for each publication you might have

              something like how long does it take for

              that table to get to a steady state.  I'm

              sure that is different for different tables

              depending on the kind of survey you're

              dealing with and so on so I'm sure that has

              to be one of the crucial aspects of how

              often you need to revise.  That has to be a

              critical factor in terms of when to freeze

              because you don't want to freeze if you're

              going to have to change it the next day,

              for example.  That's number one.

                       The other question is once a data

              changes would anybody want you to give the








              chron data?  Are there people who want that

              one from that day?  Does it happen?  I

              think that can happen in the context of

              what Randy was saying earlier, someone who

              is trying to develop a methodology.  Those

              people, they probably don't care about two

              days number, obviously.  So they are

              willing to work with your last year's data

              or whatever.  All that is important to them

              is that it stays stable.

                       For each survey you may want to

              say okay, what percentage of my users 컴컴

              first time who just want stable numbers

              versus what percentage of people want this

              data that is current, two days.  I'm sure

              even that is two issues.  One is the steady

              state time.  How long does it take to

              achieve that steady state for each

              publication is number one.  Number two, in

              terms of customers what percentage are

              those looking for the steady state number

              versus today's number.  I think those two








              issues should be taken into account when

              you're deciding the number of revisions and

              so on.

                       MR. BREIDT:  I have a question

              about this acceptable practice on

              components not summing to the total.  Is

              that just in the case where you have a

              column with missing values?

                       MS. JENNINGS:  Rene, do you know

              of any other examples where we actually

              have that?

                       MR. KASS:  The problem comes up

              when we have the NAs.  Behind the NAs there

              is an estimated value and that goes into

              the total.  When we distribute it

              electronically that 컴컴 a zero.  I get

              calls all the time, how come I don't add up

              to your --

                       MR. BREIDT:  Oh, it shows as a

              zero rather than a missing value?

                       MR. KASS:  EIA does not stand

              behind the number because of credibility








              issues.  We have rules about suppression if

              we don't have a certain portion of

              responses in.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Why don't you call it

              an NA and not a zero?

                       MR. KASS:  It has to do with the

              way the database is created.  It doesn't

              accept numerics.  An NA would be an alpha

              character and a dot translates to a zero.

                       DR. FEDER:  Could that 컴컴 like

              different colors?

                       MR. KASS:  We can't assume that

              the people who get our numbers can

              recognize color or fonts or anything.

                       DR. SITTER:  So this has nothing

              to do with the revisions?

                       MR. KASS:  No, the fact that it

              sums up has to do with revision because the

              question is if we were to revise at a state

              level should we have a corresponding

              revision to the national level.

                       DR. SITTER:  No, but it didn't add








              up before.

                       MR. KASS:  Right.

                       DR. SITTER:  So if it's not adding

              up before it doesn't add up now what's the

              revision got to do with that?

                       DR. BURTON:  Well, you're taking

              one of the NAs that were not acceptable for

              release and replacing that with a number

              that is so I don't see any harm in changing

              the total.

                       DR. SITTER:  Well, the issue of

              whether it should sum up to the total has

              nothing to do with your revision.  It

              didn't sum up to the total before.

                       MR. KASS:  I misspoke.  What

              summed up to the total were the numbers

              behind the NA.  What we released is not the

              number behind the NA but rather --

                       DR. SITTER:  I don't understand

              the question.  Would it ever be acceptable

              practice to publish data where the

              components do not sum to the total?  You're








              already doing that.  It's nothing to do

              with revision.  I don't understand the

              connection to revision.  Revision doesn't

              change it.  It doesn't make it any worse,

              doesn't make it any --

                       DR. FEDER:  It's a separate issue.

                       DR. SITTER:  Yes, it's a separate

              issue is what I'm saying.

                       DR. FEDER:  What we saw yesterday

              in one of the breakout sessions, there was

              a line called balancing item and you could

              have that with a footnote saying those

              represent the sum of the states for which

              reliable data are not available yet before

              they are attributed to 컴컴 whatever so

              people will say it's a part of that item.

                       DR. BURTON:  I have a question.

              When the data go out in the tabular form

              that NAs are represented by zeros is there

              a note so that the user is going to know

              that those zeros actually reflect an NA?

              Because in my world there's a very big








              difference.

                       MR. KASS:  They have to refer to

              the PDFs in order to know that.

                       DR. BURTON:  But if I'm diligent I

              will see it.

                       MR. KASS:  If you are diligent you

              will know.

                       DR. BURTON:  Well, if I'm lazy and

              I mess up that's my problem.

                       MR. BREIDT:  It seems like

              anything would be better than a zero,

              negative 99 or something.

                       DR. SITTER:  I have a real problem

              with an answer that says our database can't

              handle a nonnumeric.  As a user I'm just

              like, well, change the database.  I'm sorry

              if that sounds harsh but that's just not

              acceptable.

                       MR. KASS:  I'm not involved with

              that.

                       DR. SITTER:  Well, even more than

              that I would want the imputed value with








              the star that tells me it's an imputed

              value.  I don't quite understand because if

              you've got an imputed value it means you

              have some estimate which you're not willing

              to stand behind.  I'm quite willing for you

              to tell me this point is something I don't

              stand behind but if you've got it I'd like

              to see it.  You do that.  Oh, you suppress

              it; you don't star it?

                       DR. FEDER:  They suppress, yes,

              and the total will be published 컴컴 that's

              a common practice 컴컴 you suppress cells

              for which you cannot have enough precision

              but you know the total is precise.  And

              sometimes you have a very odd situation

              because only one cell is suppressed.  They

              say I have an estimate for Hawaii.  I know;

              it's 49.

                       DR. SITTER:  No, I understand the

              issue.  It's a big difference between the

              imputed value being used for the State of

              Arkansas and the imputed value being used








              in the estimate of the total.

                       DR. BURTON:  But I agree with

              Randy.  If you warn me that that's the case

              and I choose at my own peril to go out and

              use it I'd still rather see it than not.

              But if you're intent on saving me from

              myself I should be grateful.

                       DR. FEDER:  Mark, what you say now

              I've said so many times.  I was told time

              and again because users think that

              statistics are real and so we have to

              suppress it to guard them from themselves.

              It's a losing battle.  But you're right.

              What you're saying is what I've been saying

              all the time.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  I mean, you say it

              is 1.372357 and say it's only an estimate.

                       DR. BURTON:  Honestly, I've

              learned that in a policy setting I round

              everything so that it looks like a little

              lump because if you do extend it out people

              will absolutely assume you've got that much








              precision in your estimates.

                       MR. BREIDT:  I've often advocated

              with no success that you just publish a

              range and not a point.  And it's a big

              range.

                       DR. FEDER:  Last time we talked a

              little bit about this in a breakout

              session.  I mentioned something from my

              experience where the suppressions rules are

              not even inconsistent.  It's a common

              thread that many official statistics do

              that.  Whether it's wise I don't know.

                       DR. SITTER:  It seems more of a

              political decision and not a data decision.

              I mean, I don't care.  If a user is so

              unsophisticated that they're going to do

              something silly they're going to do

              something silly whether you put an NA there

              or a zero there or 컴컴 that's my view.

                       DR. FEDER:  I'll give you one

              example that I think is very paradoxical.

              In a certain survey they suppressed an








              estimate if no cases were observed because

              that's the rule.  You observe a zero, you

              don't publish anything.  But if you observe

              one and it runs to zero 컴컴 you put the

              zero.  Now, if you don't observe anything

              you don't put the zero but if you observe

              one you do put the zero?  Is that

              consistent?  We are trying to change that.

                       DR. SITTER:  No, I'm okay with

              that.  Now I know there's a difference

              between these two things.  Whatever code

              you use I want to know the difference

              between a zero that's a zero.  Even if your

              definition of a zero is it fell below 500

              at least I know there was a value and that

              value was low.  I want to know the

              difference between that and an NA.  An NA

              is a completely different animal.  An NA, I

              can make some assumption, if I'm willing

              to, that the NAs are distributed in some

              ways like the rest of the data.

                       DR. BURTON:  Well, that's exactly








              right.  If I see an NA and I need a value

              I'll do my own imputation 컴컴 that's a

              very different signal.

                       DR. FEDER:  Mark and Randy, let me

              tell you one thing 컴컴 does do which I

              think is good, at least in one instance I

              know.  If you call them and say will you

              please give me the number they'll give it

              to you over the phone.  I guess.  I'm

              guessing.  They say you are sophisticated

              enough to handle this.  You are 21 or older

              컴컴 but we won't publish it.  I don't know

              if this is still the practice.  I haven't

              been 컴컴 for seven, eight years now but

              that was the practice, to give it to you

              over the phone with some caution and call

              me in the morning.

                       DR. BURTON:  With regard to the

              issue to when and how often you should

              revise this is just another example of what

              we were talking about earlier, that you

              have such a diverse set of users with such








              diverse purposes that I don't know that

              you'll ever be able to get any consensus.

                       For example, Mark because of his

              applications tends to want very current

              data.  He would not only accept frequent

              revisions but probably would advocate them.

              I on the other hand because I tend to work

              in academic setting where it doesn't

              matter, as somebody said earlier, it

              doesn't matter when it was.  I just need to

              know when it was.

                       I'd probably rather see fewer

              revisions and then only when they're going

              to make a really significant difference in

              the interpretation of the data.  So you're

              between a rock and a hard place.  You're

              never going to make everybody happy.  I

              could pretty much promise you that.

                       MS. MILLER:  But in this situation

              where we have large changes to state data

              we would want to make the changes for the

              state user but then it doesn't affect the








              national total.  So you wouldn't have a

              problem with having small fluctuations in

              the national total as a result of that?

                       DR. BURTON:  Like Randy said, the

              numbers don't add up to the total anyway so

              who cares?

                       MS. MILLER:  So you don't care if

              the total changes?

                       DR. BURTON:  If it does or it

              doesn't it doesn't --

                       MS. JENNINGS:  Any more questions

              or comments?

                       DR. FEDER:  It's more than

              ridiculous sometimes or of great

              importance.  I know sometimes local

              governments need to know if their value has

              changed.  And for them the fluctuations

              that we saw on those revisions for one of

              the states really matter if it was 819 or

              823 or 829 because they look at last year's

              data and they want to know.  And we talked

              about the imprecision of estimates of








              change but it matters a lot to them if it

              went up or down.  So there's a trade-ff

              here.

                       DR. SITTER:  And I think to some

              extent they do have your series.  I mean,

              you are publishing your revision revised,

              revised, revised?

                       MS. JENNINGS:  Yes.

                       DR. SITTER:  So you can see it.

              You can see how stable it is.  Is it still

              changing?  So there's more information than

              just the latest greatest value.  Like when

              you gave that table you said, see, we got

              back to where we'd started but yes, we can

              see that.  So we have more information than

              that last number.  It's quite a bit

              different.

                       MS. JENNINGS:  And what you're

              saying is that means something to you as a

              user.  That's what we're trying to

              determine, as a user what's most important

              to you.  And the comments have been made








              that we have a diverse group of users.

                       DR. SITTER:  But one of the

              concerns raised in the talk but weren't in

              any of the questions or maybe it's hidden

              in there is the issue of what impact that

              has on a whole bunch of other documents and

              how you're going to coordinate that kind of

              revision.  You make those revisions.  Are

              you updating every other publication that

              uses them?

                       MS. JENNINGS:  That speaks

              directly to Rene's portion of the talk.

                       MS. MILLER:  Yes, we're attempting

              to do it but because of different

              publication schedules sometimes we do and

              sometimes we don't.

                       MS. JENNINGS:  That goes back to

              the scheduling issue of revising across

              EIA.

                       DR. BURTON:  Like grand master

              table that crosses-indexes all the

              different uses.  So you just depend on








              people remembering hey, that got used over

              here too?

                       MS. JENNINGS:  Yes.  Yes,

              definitely.

                       DR. FEDER:  I have a question on

              the data.  I don't know how far this

              concept is.  I don't if Randy knows --

                       DR. SITTER:  I think that's your

              biggest problem.  Inside a data set like

              this you're showing me what you've done.

              As long as I know what you've done I can

              deal with that.

                       MS. MILLER:  Where do we publish

              what we've done?

                       MS. BLESSING:  You do have to go

              back to previous editions.  The table that

              Alethea showed with all the revisions, that

              was created by you guys.  So, Randy, if you

              컴컴 publication you wouldn't 컴컴

                       MS. MILLER:  That wouldn't make

              you happy.

                       DR. BURTON:  Unless you have saved








              earlier versions that you accessed.

                       MS. JENNINGS:  That's right.

                       MS. BLESSING:  You'd have to go to

              the April and the May and the June and the

              July and the August and you'd have to write

              it down yourself.

                       MS. MILLER:  But all of these

              publications, I mean, we've got these from

              the web.

                       MS. BLESSING:  They're all there.

              It's just not as clean as what you showed.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  So could I ask my

              question again?  Who wants to go back and

              track it?  Does a typical user want to go

              and track it?  I know Randy might want to

              do it for research.

                       DR. SITTER:  No, no.  I probably

              would use the most recent one but I'd know

              what I was getting myself into if I could

              see that.  I take a look at that and I say

              well, the most recent one.  That kind of

              fluctuation is not going to bother me.








                       DR. NEERCHAL:  That's an atypical

              user who can just make a call and say how

              stable these numbers are.  I think that may

              be an infrequent situation.  The person who

              wants today's data probably doesn't really

              care what happened yesterday because his

              use is so instantaneous he's not going to

              care what happened yesterday.

                       DR. BURTON:  Colleen, I have no

              trouble with the responsibility.  If I see

              that R there and I know that the one that

              I'm reviewing in the current publication is

              a revised value then I may say okay, I need

              to know how stable this is and go back.

              And as long as the other stuff is

              accessible then I'm good with that being my

              responsibility to go back because there

              will also be most settings where I don't

              care.  It's not going to affect the

              ultimate quality of what I do whether it's

              stable or not so I'm just going to use

              what's there.








                       MS. BLESSING:  I think the key

              point is as long as the archived versions

              are there.  I think for some data series

              they're easy to get to and some data series

              they're not so easy to get to.

                       MS. MILLER:  I think everybody for

              the monthly publications --

                       MS. BLESSING:  They're all easy?

                       MS. MILLER:  They all seem to be

              available.

                       MR. KASS:  You've got to define

              "easy."  The PDFs are all there.

                       MS. MILLER:  Yes.

                       MR. KASS:  The electronic

              downloaded material is exclusively current

              value.

                       DR. SITTER:  But this issue about

              propagation through other publications,

              that is absolutely critical, not because

              you do or don't do but you don't know what

              you do.  I mean, this is far worse than

              what you do or don't do because you can't








              tell.  And somebody's going to take

              different aspects of your data and try to

              combine them together, assuming that

              they're internally consistent, and some of

              these are really not very -- I mean, some

              of these changes are big.

                       You take an NA and you replace by

              11,000, this could be a huge thing.  You do

              it in one and not in another, all of a

              sudden you see a significant difference

              somewhere and you think it's real, and it's

              nothing to do with that.  One's revised and

              one has an unrevised thing built into it

              somewhere that you don't know and it's all

              hidden.  That's really serious.

                       MS. MILLER:  Yes, we're getting a

              much better handle on this through our

              interoffice issues group because we have

              people from all the offices, so we've been

              learning a lot about each other's data.

                       MS. BLESSING:  And, Rene, I think

              you or Alethea pointed out that when we had








              paper publications people just got one or

              another paper publication.  It wasn't as

              easy, maybe, to see these differences but

              now that we're on the web and you can go

              click, click, click, and see three

              different numbers there's an awareness

              because of the easiness of getting all the

              pieces of information that we have to make

              some changes.

                       MS. JENNINGS:  That's true.

                       DR. SITTER:  Well, that's your

              viewpoint.  I mean, now they can find out

              so now it's worse?

                       MS. MILLER:  It is better because

              it is forcing us to actually face the

              issues.  It wasn't as glaring before

              because it was much harder to see.

                       MR. KASS:  It wasn't a problem

              because we couldn't see it.

                       MS. MILLER:  컴컴 nobody tells us

              everything is fine.

                       DR. BURTON:  Do you know what sort








              of things are going on administration-wide?

              This is a bigger issue than this group.  Do

              you know if there are plans to maybe try

              and address this systematically at some

              point?  Obviously you've put together a

              program that provides a path for making

              sure that revisions 컴컴 are disseminated

              based on people's own knowledge of what's

              in what document but do you know if there's

              any thought toward automating this kind of

              process?

                       MS. BLESSING:  Is it an issue that

              ever comes up in the inter-agency heads?  I

              think that's what he's asking.

                       MS. MILLER:  Are you talking about

              with other agencies or just within EIA?

                       MS. BLESSING:  Just within EIA

              컴컴 that's what you're doing.

                       MR. KASS:  That essentially is

              what we're doing.  The problem came up with

              final data because unless told otherwise

              once data are declared final they're shared








              throughout the organization and other

              groups within EIA don't bother looking at

              the source systems any more.  The situation

              that Rene talked about, data that had been

              declared final were changed 컴컴 simply

              weren't told about it.

                       DR. BURTON:  So what you're

              telling me is that, given the program that

              you all developed, final data won't be a

              problem.  Those changes will get made now

              or revised.  In trying to get to that point

              where they're final there may still be

              issues but, given the work that you're

              doing, once the data are declared final

              then if there are any revisions that's

              taken care of.

                       MS. MILLER:  Yes.

                       DR. FEDER:  Years ago the

              Economist published some assessment, and

              maybe they still do, assessing national

              statistical agencies.  I noticed in the

              tabulation that some had very few revisions








              but took the time to publish and others

              published frequently and revised a lot.  I

              mean, this was my area just as a reader, so

              take it for what it's worth.  If you are

              quick to publish I think that's good and

              you have to be prepared to revise what you

              publish.  Now, how the Economist views that

              I don't remember, and I don't think it

              really matters.  But if you publish timely

              data 컴컴

                       DR. SITTER:  Let's look at the

              example from the natural gas in Texas.

              Here is a case where your strategy would be

              just awful.  I'm not saying that you do

              this but it would be awful.

                       The pattern is very clear.  One

              month after the date it's always 15 percent

              low, two months after the date it's 4

              percent low, three months after the date

              it's very close to the final value, and

              after that it's pretty stable.  But I can't

              see that.  I just see your current value.








                       If you actually showed me that I

              would see that immediately and say wow,

              okay, I've got a lot of information here.

              I've got information about the pattern in

              which the data arrives.  These don't have

              any pattern.  This just seems to be more

              fluctuation 컴컴 and that's more common.

                       But I think this goes back to the

              point that it's going to depend on the data

              set and whether the latest greatest is best

              and when to revise and how often to revise.

              One decision about that would be don't

              publish it until three months after.  That

              was the same thing or in this case we're

              going to have to give you the previous

              three or four revised values so that you

              can see that pattern or some decision like

              that.  So I think the comment it depends is

              always good.  It depends on the actual

              publication and the data.

                       DR. BURTON:  Well, Randy, didn't

              we actually spend some time last fall








              looking at a situation, either this

              situation or one like it, and saying okay,

              these reporting patterns are so dependable

              that we can take these and do estimated

              values in those first and second months and

              release those as estimated values, knowing

              that they're going to be far more accurate

              than what is actually reported?

                       DR. SITTER:  That's right and that

              is a form of imputation, and we seemed okay

              with that in this particular case but not

              in general.

                       MS. JENNINGS:  Are there any more

              questions or any more comments?  Well,

              certainly we appreciate your input.  Thank

              you so much.

                       DR. SITTER:  One question on

              publication.  You talk about the final

              data.  Could you clarify the distinction,

              final and nonfinal?  I just wanted to

              clarify the point about what is final data

              versus nonfinal data.








                       MS. MILLER:  And I was saying that

              when we initially published our monthly

              data we published them with a "P" for

              preliminary.  And then what often times

              happens is that we get late respondents,

              and we have a lot of those, and respondents

              sometimes resubmit.  And so then the

              following month we'll revise.  Then we

              usually wait until the end of the reporting

              cycle to get all the revisions in and then

              different offices have different procedures

              for when they declare their data to be

              final.

                       But it takes into account the late

              respondents, the resubmissions, and any

              other errors that we might find.  Like in

              Roy's situation, he benchmarks the monthly

              data and it's with an annual number so we

              also have that.  So it's quite a series of

              steps.  When we spoke to the people at

              Census and 컴컴 they seem to go through a

              similar iterative process.








                       DR. SITTER:  And as I understand

              it most of what you have been working on is

              on the final data.  The others, your

              questions were less firm.

                       MS. MILLER:  Right, where we were

              able to come to some consensus on what to

              do and how to coordinate was with the final

              data.  Before the data became final

              basically we couldn't come to agreement

              that we were all going to revise at a

              certain time or we were just going to

              publish a certain number of revisions.  And

              basically we were showing you the natural

              gas data as an example of some of the

              challenges and why we couldn't come to a

              consensus.

                       DR. SITTER:  I just wanted to

              clarify.  Thank you.

                       MR. WEINIG:  Thank you both.

                            (Recess)

                       MR. BREIDT:  We're ready now for

              the summaries by the ASA Committee members








              on the breakout sessions.  Randy, do you

              want to go first on the revising data?

                       DR. SITTER:  No, I'll go second.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Please?

                       DR. SITTER:  How much time do I

              have, Jay?

                       MR. BREIDT:  Take what you need.

                       DR. SITTER:  Take what I need,

              okay.  First of all, what were we talking

              about, revising data across EIA, should

              they change their standards, what are their

              standards, and so forth.  This was based on

              two points.  One example is EIA's expanded

              use of electric power data and using it in

              a lot more publications.  This is just an

              example, I imagine, of other situations

              like this.  So if you revise one it's going

              to have an impact on a lot of different

              publications.

                       And it's easier to do revisions

              and to detect when you do revisions so this

              has raised some questions about should they








              change their revision schedules, how do you

              coordinate such revisions across EIA, when

              should you do them, should you do them, et

              cetera.  So the specific questions asked to

              the committee, one was that the EIA's

              revision standards were built in the '80s.

              There was a concern for credibility and it

              was a basic assumption that you should

              limit the number of revisions and was that

              still a good assumption.

                       Regarding natural gas specifically

              there was a question about whether there's

              a better method for doing that.  Three, is

              it ever acceptable to publish data that

              does not benchmark to the national total?

              And, four, what about the latest greatest,

              is it really the latest greatest or is it

              just the latest in terms of instantaneous

              updates?

                       I would say that it was a heated

              discussion by a group of reasonably

              admittedly uninformed nonexperts and that








              what EIA was really doing was using us as

              an end-user group that they hadn't sampled

              yet, or at least that's the way we took our

              role, I believe, and there was really no

              attempt at directly answering the first two

              questions though they're all, of course

              interrelated.

                       One committee member did say that

              they always want the latest; the latest is

              best.  But you need to balance cost, of

              course, so these two things are an issue,

              most up to date versus the cost of

              revising.

                       Other comments that were made were

              it's going to be specific to the data set,

              how steady state does different data, how

              quickly does it get to some form of steady

              state.  So another balancing act is most

              current versus stability.

                       You have a diverse end user group

              and some of your end users what they want

              is what is the number I'm going to use and








              what is it today, what's the best you've

              got, so those are the latest is the

              greatest.  And then there are those such

              as, say, myself who I don't care if it's

              three years old as long as it's stable so

              that if I refer to it it's going to still

              be referable.  So there's the combination

              of those two things.

                       I think there was one more comment

              on the latest greatest.  Getting at

              previous versions will be an issue for some

              end users; that is, it's okay to put your

              latest greatest.  It's okay for it to be my

              responsibility to go and see how that's

              been changing in a revised schedule when I

              see an R behind it.  In other words is it

              at a steady state?  That's fine as long as

              I can get at it.  EIA people said well, you

              can but sometimes it's not as easy as other

              times and perhaps that's something we

              should look at.

                       And then is it ever acceptable?








              There was quite a debate about benchmarking

              to national totals.  One committee member

              pointed out this is a separate issue and

              has nothing to do with revisions since they

              already don't add up to the totals before

              you revised since you've got those NAs in

              there and we don't get to see them.  So

              from an end user point of view you even may

              put them as zeros in the published version

              which we didn't like at all.  There's a big

              difference between a zero and an NA.

                       One of the committee members

              didn't really like the answer that the

              database wouldn't handle nonnumeric numbers

              as a reason for that.  So there were some

              issues around that and some debate about

              whether you should actually give the

              numbers and tell us they're imputed or not.

              Even the committee wasn't in total

              agreement, I think, because we also are a

              diverse group of end users.

                       I think there was agreement that








              we would certainly like to know the

              difference between a number that you're not

              making available to us and one that is an

              actual near zero value because there is a

              difference analytically as to how you would

              treat those two things.

                       One other issue discussed was the

              bigger issue around the propagation to

              other publications even though that wasn't

              one of the specific questions.  That's

              probably of most concern but the topic of

              the talk by EIA presentation didn't say

              that this is essentially what they're doing

              with their final data.  So once they've

              declared the data final they're

              coordinating within the different agencies

              within EIA to schedule the revisions and

              try to take care of that propagation

              problem at least with the final data, more

              difficult to do on the nonfinal data but I

              don't think that we would be as concerned

              with the nonfinal data since it's stated as








              being in progress.  I think that's all the

              committee had to say.  Thank you.

                       MR. BREIDT:  And now, Nicolas,

              summarize the survey quality assessments of

              EIA, please.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  We had what I

              would call a frank discussion on the

              problem of assessing the quality of EIA

              products.  That is very much in part a

              management problem, trying to assess how

              good each survey is and trying to also set

              targets to possibly improve the surveys in

              future years.

                       The notion is that there are

              problems with doing that.  Some of the

              things that came up was, for example, that

              although we are able to assess the survey

              if it is possible nevertheless the

              landscape might be changing over time.  And

              so not only should we try to track how the

              surveys are doing but also trying to see

              what is the landscape, how is the industry








              changing at the same time as the survey as

              to match the two, not to give a distorted

              image.

                       The other thing that came up was

              the notion of data quality.  I would

              paraphrase it as to answer efficiently the

              asked question and although the right

              question to be asked is usually looked at

              in the design stage it might be worthwhile

              to revisit on a periodic basis if we still

              are asking the right questions, if the

              users are finding it useful, if there's

              some usefulness to it.  So that is in part

              something that wasn't in the document that

              we were looking at.

                       Then there came again notions of

              interviews and trying to see how do we

              extract or how do we get those

              measurements.  As in some the sessions of

              yesterday, there were notions of well, we

              can interview the teams and talk to them

              and trying to see through focus groups what








              they think.

                       There were in parallel to

              yesterday notions that maybe it's a good

              idea to separate the management and the

              staff interviews for brainstorming sessions

              and other interviews in the hope that one

              gets a more frank and realistic picture of

              what's going on.

                       The other problem that arises then

              is once you measure the quality of the

              survey and the data how do you disseminate.

              How do you get feedback without sounding

              critical, without having this sense of

              competition, acknowledging that each survey

              has different quality targets because they

              are either in very easy situations 컴컴 the

              response rate might not be an issue for one

              survey and might be a very big issue in

              another survey and so trying to acknowledge

              this.

                       One thing that came up, for

              example, is to try to bring in a kind of








              lessons learned, trying to get positive

              feedback and say these are the kinds of

              problems that we've encountered in our

              situation; this is how we solved them.

              Being able to do that would allow more

              positive feedback.

                       The other thing that was suggested

              is to also that the measures that we get

              here are retrospective in that they tell us

              what has been done.  It was suggested that

              one should also have the opportunity to

              look forward and say this is what's on the

              landscape, for example, deregulation, and

              that is possibly how it's going to affect

              the quality of the survey and because of

              this we'll need to already be able to put

              in more resources.

                       And in fact what came out at the

              end is that this whole exercise of being

              able to get quality surveys should be also

              tied in possible resource allocations, say

              well, if there's a true difficulty here








              then we need to do something about it.  And

              the way to do something about it might not

              be simply to crack the whip but also to say

              well, we're going to allow you and provide

              you means to address these issues.

                       Finally there was the question of

              do people understand why they're collecting

              the data and how important it is.  The

              general agreement is that everybody here at

              EIA knows how important it is.  This is

              really something very important.  But there

              was also the use of contractors and

              bringing them into the loop and making them

              feel how important it is by, for example,

              sharing quotes or pictures that appear in

              the news that they produced would be a

              boost in trying to explain to them why it

              matters.

                       That is my summary.  As I said, it

              was a very interesting session.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Thanks, Nick.  At

              this time we have a moment for invitation








              for public comments.  Are there any

              comments?

                       We'll be taking a break and

              following the break the committee will be

              discussing possible topics for the --

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  Can I recommend we

              don't take a break and just --

                       MR. BREIDT:  Let's go ahead and do

              it because that way we have opportunity for

              the public to leave if they want to because

              after the break there's nothing really on

              the agenda except for the committee members

              to discuss what's going on.  So go ahead

              and take a short break.  Take 10 minutes if

              you'd like.

                            (Recess)

                       MR. BREIDT:  We have some time now

              to talk about possible topics for the fall

              meeting.  A few things have come up in

              discussions and maybe other people have

              come up with others as we were talking.

              We're talking now about possible topics for








              the fall meeting.  A few things have come

              up during different breakout sessions and

              maybe we can just put a few things down on

              the list and then add to it as we go.

                       These frame comparisons that the

              Census Bureau is doing is one possibility.

              That came up in the breakout session on

              frame adequacy.  Another I think came up in

              regional components for the STIFS model.

              And then there was some mention of this

              Dallas paper.  I don't know what it was

              about but it was prepped for this meeting

              but didn't make the agenda.

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes, Dallas has

              another proposal for natural gas production

              in Texas.  This is to correct the bias.

                       DR. SITTER:  That's perfect.

              That's going to force us to do what we were

              going to do.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Yes.

                       DR. FEDER:  Could I suggest a

              topic?








                       MR. BREIDT:  Sure.

                       DR. FEDER:  It came out in our

              breakout session.  Should estimates be

              harmonized across surveys and should

              estimates add up to the total, also known

              as benchmarking.  We asked about revisions.

              We talked about revisions.  There was a

              somewhat related issue that people other

              than myself were talking about is that

              should 컴컴 of low quality be suppressed or

              published with caution?  I think that these

              are all related.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  On the same theme

              as the issue from yesterday where we were

              talking about short-term energy outlook,

              data that was being used versus the date

              collected on the weekly 컴컴 but a broader

              discussion about the information being used

              in one part of the agency versus the data

              collected in the other part of the agency.

              I mean, I don't know how to structure that

              into a session but it's an issue.








                       DR. HENGARTNER:  There's something

              else I'd like to bring up.  As an ASA

              committee I think we have the option of

              having an ASA session at JSA.  I think the

              last few times they had really cool stuff

              to talk about.

                       DR. SITTER:  You joined at the

              right time.  It was boring stuff before.

                       DR. FEDER:  You're talking about

              this coming JSA?

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  No, no, not in

              Toronto, the one after.  And we need to

              think about this now if we want to do it.

              We don't need to pick the topics but if

              we're going to do it maybe have a list of

              topics and invite the speakers 컴컴

                       MS. SEREIKA:  If it's invited

              sessions it'd be going on right now.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  It's an invited

              session for next year.  I don't know where

              it's going to be.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Minneapolis.








                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Oh, God.  No,

              let's wait a year.

                       DR. FEDER:  Canada, maybe.

                       DR. SITTER:  You're the person

              that has to deal with this.  You're on top

              of this already, right?

                       MR. BREIDT:  I haven't received

              anything yet on the invited sessions for

              '05 but that comes out in early summer,

              doesn't it?

                       MS. SEREIKA:  Yes, I think it's

              June.

                       MR. BREIDT:  June or July.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  So we need to

              make a decision as a group, do we want to

              try something like that, and if yes that we

              get it done.  The other thing is

              replacements.  We need to get a consensus

              of who's rotating out and have a list of

              names already ready.

                       MS. SEREIKA:  Trends, he's looking

              at trends.








                       DR. HENGARTNER:  So that's

              something that needs to be on the agenda.

                       MR. BREIDT:  It needs to be a

              homework assignment for us which is to come

              next time with suggested names.

                       MS. FORSYTH:  Has it been six

              years already?

                       MR. BREIDT:  It has.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Are you leaving?

                       MR. BREIDT:  Yes, after next time.

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  Bill Moss is off

              the committee for health reasons.  There's

              a vacancy right now.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Is he going to

              rejoin or he's going to stay off?

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  I think he

              retired.  I think he resigned.

                       MR. BREIDT:  We just haven't made

              that real obvious to the ASA until we get

              our suggested replacement.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Well, if we need

              a suggestion right now if we have five








              minutes do you want to brainstorm?

                       DR. SITTER:  I'd need to know

              who's coming off.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Bill Moss.

                       DR. SITTER:  Bill Moss and Jay.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  Bill is gone now.

                       MS. FORSYTH:  I don't know Bill.

              Is he a mathematical statistician?

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  No, he's an energy

              economist.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Energy guy.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  So it would be

              nice to replace him with another energy

              person.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Would a macro

              person work?  I don't know.  Steve Berry,

              labor statistics at Yale.

                       DR. BURTON:  He's smart.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Well, he's my

              friend.

                       MR. KASS:  I'm going to have to

              reconsider my statement.








                       DR. HENGARTNER:  He's good.  He

              would be good for our committee.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  There is a young

              faculty at Berkeley, Energy Resources, Alex

              Farrell.  He has done work for DOE in the

              past.  I know he uses a lot of the data and

              information.  He certainly may be a good

              person to transition because I'm only

              giving one more year after this.  I know

              he's been a big user of EIA material.

                       DR. BURTON:  A brainstorm, this is

              more like a brain flurry.

                       DR. SITTER:  The only economists I

              know are on this committee.

                       MR. KASS:  I suppose one could go

              to the International Association of Energy

              Economics and ask for a suggestion.

                       MS. KHANNA:  I know one person

              who's more of an environment economist but

              does do energy-related work.  It's John

              Erickson at the University of Vermont.  I

              think he's with the Department of Natural








              Resources.  He is a state economist.

                       MR. WEINIG:  Periodically there

              are suggestions of getting one or more

              industry specialists into this area.  And

              if we had a view of three to six years of

              one or more industry specialists that might

              be a place to return because this was a

              strategy that the committee used to have

              and steered away from and this now may be a

              good time to re-think that.

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  We had some

              statisticians from oil companies and from

              electric power companies and coal through

              the years.  There aren't that may of them

              so you go through them pretty fast.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  You said business

              sector.  Which sector would be most useful

              for EIA, coal, petroleum, gas?

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  Probably gas and

              electricity.  Those are our big problem

              areas right now.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  How about somebody








              from the Gas Technology Institute?  You can

              ask them or I can give you a name of

              somebody there to ask for a recommendation.

              It's going to be hard to get somebody from

              a company because they'll have often times

              a narrow viewpoint but somebody from EPRI

              or somebody from GTI.  I don't know.

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  There's a list of

              things to consider.

                       MR. BREIDT:  How about other

              topics for the fall meeting?

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  컴컴 follow-ons

              for a number of the things you've heard

              about.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Susan has a

              suggestion.

                       MS. SEREIKA:  Could you invite one

              of these industry specialists to make an

              appearance, more as an invitation, not

              necessarily have them a member of the

              committee.

                       MR. KASS:  Right.








                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  Yes, we can do

              that.

                       MS. SEREIKA:  Do something like

              that, like have an invited guest, I guess,

              from different industries for each

              different meeting?

                       MR. KASS:  I had the same good

              idea; I just didn't say it.

                       DR. SITTER:  Me, too.

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  And that would

              be tied, obviously, to the agenda 컴컴 a

              lot on --

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  Right, a

              particular topic.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  I certainly

              wouldn't mind talking about the

              transmissions issues again next time, what

              has happened, what has not, what are the

              objectives, if you've gotten around to

              deciding what you're actually going to do,

              how you're going to do it.

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  I missed the








              transmission issue discussion.  Was it

              about the issue as a modeling issue?  Was

              it about the issue as what data we should

              be trying to collect there?

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  Well, the

              discussion became a hybrid of both a little

              bit but I think it came back down to not a

              clear goal in mind for what you want to do

              with something that you get.  In other

              words what do you want to do with

              transmission data and what reports do you

              want to have?  What do you want to be able

              to do with it and then design your data and

              analysis to that.  It was pretty clear that

              that was not 컴컴 two years from now how do

              you want the electric output to look and

              what do you want it to include on

              transmission sites.  So that would be

              something to do.

                       Guy brought up a couple of things

              as we went along.  We're spending a lot of

              time responding to crisis issues and that's








              not totally the reason but you're getting

              more of that than you used to.  How do you

              begin to structure the system to be able to

              handle that?

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  There's another

              one that I hope will not come up and I

              don't know that it's a good one for the

              committee but we probably face at some

              point in part because of some new work that

              we have to do, in part because of the

              budget situation, probably really some

              decisions about doing less of some things.

              So we're doing a whole lot of surveys.

                       I don't think there's ever a

              discussion of laying out the scope of what

              the program is and then trying to figure

              out, well, suppose in fact the guidance

              numbers that we have for budgets going out

              to 2010 we get stuck with and we're doing

              our best not to get stuck with those.  But

              were that to happen we would need to think

              about pulling in the perimeter a little








              bit, making the program smaller.

                       I wonder if there's among

              statisticians but also policy types a

              notion of if you had to contract the

              program in terms of the data program how

              would you do it.  It's like playing Tanga.

              Which block would you pull out so that the

              whole thing doesn't come tumbling down?

              Reserve as much of the value of the program

              as you have.

                       I don't know if in other

              statistical programs that people have dealt

              with in this committee that's been an issue

              about how do you define what it is you're

              doing because at the same time there are

              these requests in certain areas to do more

              but resources are not necessarily there.

              The way I think of this is a lot of the

              talks I hear about like you decided you

              wanted to do something and how do you do it

              the right way.  That's been a lot of the

              focus whether it's estimating natural gas








              production in Texas.  We get input on that

              but is there input on the level of what do

              you do, assuming that you can't do

              everything you want to do?

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  But isn't that

              the question you should ask end users

              instead of statisticians?

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Obviously we do

              and we will ask end users and we have but I

              view end users as the demand side of this

              thing.  And obviously each end user a lot

              of that just ends up being like the

              political power of the different people.  I

              mean, their immediate reaction is not my

              survey.  I'm the American public power

              people so when you want to drop a survey of

              power public facilities, no, don't do it.

                       After all, they're paying zero for

              it.  The band curve doesn't hit the axis.

              So given that they're paying zero and given

              that it's of some use to them they want to

              continue it.  And that's true of








              everything.  I assume that most of our

              stuff probably doesn't have zero value so

              there's someone who's for it.  Then it

              becomes an issue of who's more powerful

              politically and that's how some of these

              things get sorted out.  So that's

              definitely a big part of what actually is

              going to happen.

                       In some sense part of the program

              is set up to meet demand.  Particular

              people want this and people want that.  But

              part of it was set up to be how do we set

              up a good statistical program for the

              energy sector.  And that's not necessarily

              driven by demand.  I mean, that's driven by

              what people thought was included in a good

              statistical program for the energy sector.

                       I mean, obviously this other side

              is going to matter a whole lot but I'm just

              wondering if on that side if you had to

              make a statistical program for the energy

              sector smaller how would you do that








              understanding that these other things are

              going to be very important and be there

              also and may be dispositive.

                       I don't know if there is anything

              in the discipline of statistics, that how

              do you maximize the value of a program.  I

              don't know.  It may be way out of line but

              that is an issue that we face.

                       DR. BURTON:  I think a number of

              us are here with two hats on.  I mean,

              there are things like, for example, a

              number of us would say protect the data.

              We can live without the analysis, we'll do

              that ourselves, but make sure you protect

              the data to the extent possible.  Protect

              the time series.  Some of the cross-section

              stuff maybe can go but if you lose elements

              in a time series you can't go back and get

              them later.  So there are things to talk

              about.

                       DR. FEDER:  I was going to say

              exactly what Mark said.  I think he's








              right.  It's important to keep the

              continuity of the data for the sake of

              trend analysis and so on.  But because I

              think the energy market is going to be so

              important and we are facing dramatic

              changes I wouldn't change anything in terms

              of the programs.  I might be more inclined

              to say reduce the effort on each by perhaps

              reducing sample size.  I think sometimes

              economies actually can be heard by

              improving analysis and reducing data

              collection because if you do things right

              and you optimize your survey methods you

              can reduce errors --

                       DR. BURTON:  I mean, is this a

              topic worthy of --

                       DR. FEDER:  I think it is one good

              analyst can save the work of 10 field

              collections.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  I think one thing

              this committee could do is discuss and help

              design characteristics for what a good








              program should be.  I don't think we're

              going to be able to help you decide which

              things should go and come but in terms of

              what are minimum or characteristics you can

              begin to measure yourselves against and see

              that here is the minimum that you should

              have in both statistical quality and

              quantity and stuff and analysis quality

              컴컴 do something about that.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Nancy has this

              wonderful draft that she showed us about

              two or three meetings ago on where coal

              goes and where each survey's taken and so

              you have the pathway and you can see along

              the pathway each survey and the information

              it brings.  You can ask yourself can you by

              looking at this pathway impute some of the

              answers.

                       The only thing that goes through

              here is whatever comes from there and then

              I measure it down there again and that may

              be a place where you can cut corners.  It's








              confirmation data.  It's like being able to

              do accounting.  Currently you're able to do

              accounting and being able to double check.

              Those two number should be the same.  Do

              they match?

                       If you want to save money you can

              get rid of that redundancy at the cost of

              not being able to do that matching.  So

              statisticians can come up and look at this

              and say yes, we can publish and continue

              publishing the same numbers at the risk of

              not being able to double-check if those

              numbers are good.

                       So there is redundancy in the

              system.  We can help maybe identify some of

              it.  I'm not sure how wise it is to get rid

              of it but if it's that or just shutting

              down then --

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  We'll send you

              up to Congress to say you made a mistake.

                       DR. BURTON:  Well, that's what I

              was going to say.  Why not turn this whole








              thing on its head?  Do what we're talking

              about but do it in an effort to justify the

              necessary budget.  We can't as a group say

              we've examined these issues if we haven't

              looked at all the data we need.

                       DR. FEDER:  I think if you charged

              a little bit for the data you'd know which

              ones are in greater demand.

                       MS. FORSYTH:  That's true.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Talking like an

              economist.

                       DR. FEDER:  As a consumer but I

              know this might anger some people.

                       DR. SITTER:  But this notion

              really ties in to your 컴컴 because what

              you were saying is we look at the end use,

              what are we going to do with it.  Really,

              your point was that they really need an

              increase in funding for transmission.  When

              you're doing the exercise you say this is

              what they need.  What should we do to get

              it?  What would it cost?








                       I pointed out at the time, too,

              that there are two aspects to that, what

              new do we need and the change in

              deregulation, what do we give now that

              we're no longer are going to be able to do

              for the same cost because of the changing

              market?  So those relate back to this

              question.

                       You do a hypothetical budget cut

              and say this is what we will do if that's

              the case and this is the best we can do.

              And there are things we can do, doing less

              frequent surveys here and a combination

              with some analysis, less frequency there,

              and so forth but this is going to be the

              impact.

                       And then you also have data on the

              trend of deregulation, which is going to

              impact it even if you had the same

              resources.  And you just build the whole

              thing and say this is where we're going if

              you don't give us more money.








                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  We will do that

              in our own way.  There's a political thing.

              Obviously we're not saying gee, thanks,

              this is our target; here's what we're going

              to get rid of.  We're definitely going to

              make a case.  But is there anything from

              the academic side --

                       DR. SITTER:  No, I just meant that

              the topics relate quite well so I think it

              would be a nice --

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  I don't know.  I

              don't have them well thought out but posing

              it to you.  It's a little different than

              what I see as a meeting for this committee

              컴컴 there's a possibility that there may

              be something there.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  I think it's

              probably worth us taking a shot at having a

              discussion about it and seeing what we can

              contribute to your decision-making process

              that you can utilize.  I think it also

              comes back to the mission of EIA and how








              that's shifting at some level and defining

              what you want and deciding what it is you

              want and getting that filtered down.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  I feel if that's

              the kind of topic you want to address the

              committee will need to do a little bit more

              homework.  It's not just coming here and

              having the EIA give a presentation as

              shooting the breeze.  I think it's a case

              where I would feel not very comfortable

              saying anything without having sat down and

              said okay, I've got to chop $5 million off

              this budget by doing this and trying argue

              why this would be a good thing and having

              other committee members argue against it.

              It seems that this might require more

              involvement from our part but if that's

              what we want I think we have to be honest.

                       MR. WEINIG:  You probably recall

              on James Hammitt's exit from the last

              meeting last fall he suggested something

              that we haven't really responded to about








              creating a committee to create a paper.  If

              that's where you're headed it's not without

              precedent in terms of the committee's

              suggestion.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Another reaction

              of the committee when James said that is

              everybody said 컴컴 works.

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  And a free

              bagel.

                       DR. SITTER:  As an aside, our

              department decided on committees of one

              because committees take a long time to do

              anything.  And I think if you had a

              committee of 12 trying to do such a thing

              it would just be nightmarish.  If it ever

              got done it would come down to two or three

              people 컴컴 not a committee of this size.

              It just can't be done.

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  Well, the other

              thing is if we're going to do something

              like that not only would some people have

              to look at in advance.  We'd have to








              prepare something for them to look at in

              advance.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Yes.

                       MR. BERNSTEIN:  I wasn't

              suggesting that all of us go through a

              process of figuring out exactly what to do

              and I'm not sure that's what Howard asked.

              But we can have discussion about what are

              the types of things they need to take into

              account in making the decisions from a

              statistical validity-analytical validity

              standpoint.  This is a group of outsiders

              and we can maybe help focus the discussion

              that they may end up having to have.

                       And so we could lay out

              characteristics of what we think are

              important to maintain and develop that they

              can then use in evaluating programs.  It's

              almost like us helping them set up a

              strategic evaluation plan and not actually

              do it.  We're not actually going to say you

              should do this and this and this.  I think








              that's what Howard's asking is can we

              actually help them come up with ways to

              evaluate, characterize, and trade off.

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  I mean, I don't

              know if in statistics this typically comes

              up where it's not like design a program but

              you have so much resource.  There are

              probably some criteria you would use in

              building the program to do the best job

              with that resource.  Some of those same

              criteria might be of value in dealing with

              the problem that we might face or maybe in

              reverse, unfortunately.  But I'm wondering

              if there are manuals in the statistics

              literature on how to build programs of a

              certain size where you don't have unlimited

              resource but you need to build the best

              program.  I don't know about the topic that

              the literature addresses.

                       MS. FORSYTH:  No.

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  Well, you're all

              still smart people anyway.  But I think








              Mark's on the track of this notion, not

              actually if you were an administrator for a

              day or something what would you do but

              ideas on how to think about what you would

              do from the basis of the knowledge that you

              all have as statisticians and analysts.  I

              think that might be not the actual doing it

              but about the criteria.  Anyway it's just a

              thought.  It's not like you've got to do

              it.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  I just want to make

              a comment, basically, to supplement what

              has been said.  I agree with Mark that I

              don't think this committee can really get

              into the nitty-gritty of how much --

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  This survey, do

              this survey.

                       DR. NEERCHAL:  Right.  On the

              other hand I think the session which I did

              not attend, one of the breakout sessions on

              survey quality assessment, in some sense it

              should give us that information, saying








              this is the quality you're getting out of

              this survey and you know how much it is

              costing you.  I think putting those two

              information together I think that should be

              part of the discussion.

                       If the committee ends up thinking

              about it as an overall utility of the

              survey then this will be an input in more

              detail.  This is the survey, these are the

              affected people, this is the affected

              program, and this is how much it's going to

              cost you.  You don't need to tell us that;

              I don't think we can do much with it.  But

              at least as a group of people we can say

              that sounds like an important thing.  As

              Randy put it earlier, as an admittedly

              uninformed group but a useful group to get

              feedback from.

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  The way I look

              at it there are probably a few people who

              are better informed than you and then

              there's you and then there are 280 million








              people who are much less informed than you.

              So no matter how much you want to pass

              yourself off as the uninformed group the

              fact of the matter is you're probably the

              most informed group there is outside of

              people who work here.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  Well, God help

              us.

                       DR. SITTER:  I think if we're

              going to have that we would probably need

              some documents.

                       MR. GRUENSPECHT:  A document from

              us.

                       DR. SITTER:  Well, to package some

              of the things we've already seen that give

              a global view like this thought and how

              everything fits together, which surveys,

              the names, what they collect, which

              overlap, that kind of thing.  And then I

              think some idea of breakdowns of costs.  I

              don't know how you would do that but I

              would want to know at least some orders of








              magnitude about collection versus analysis,

              how much does a revision process cost.

              Like what we were talking about today, do

              we revise automatically or shouldn't we?

              And we're saying well, you have to balance

              cost.  We have no idea what that means in

              terms of cost.

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  Neither do we.

                       DR. SITTER:  So I think whether

              you get money or you lose money you're

              going to need to know what costs because

              the balance is going to come down to do we

              drop stuff or do we drop the quality of the

              stuff we have?  Those are going to be two

              big issues.  If we don't know the

              relationship between the cost of those two

              things it's going to be impossible.  At

              least orders of magnitude, it's going to be

              hard for us to do too much.  We can give

              sort of very broad stroke advice.

                       DR. BURTON:  Is there information

              available about usage by energy source by








              fuel type, by sector, industry versus

              government versus academic?  Is there

              demand side information 컴컴 do you know?

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  I don't really

              know.  There may be something on web usage.

              We track a lot of web usage and to the

              extent you can break it into government

              industry, academia they may have something

              like that.  I'm not sure that we have much

              else.  We have listservs with e-mail

              addresses so you could look at them the

              same way.  There's some information.

                       One of the things we did last year

              was we have a similar list.  I don't know

              exactly which list Nick's talking about but

              we have a sampling list of these surveys.

              We've got about 70 surveys and one of the

              things we did last year was to document

              which surveys were most important, least

              important, and not used in our various

              internal analytical products.  So which are

              used in NEMS, which are used in STEO, which








              are used in our integrated products.

                       DR. BURTON:  That probably is a

              pretty good indication of what the rest of

              the world does with it too.

                       MS. KIRKENDALL:  It might well be.

                       DR. BURTON:  We're all trying to

              get to the same direction.

                       DR. SITTER:  One thing that always

              bothers me over the years that I've been

              here is that I was never really certain

              about the difference between EIA with a

              legislated role, and this is what EIA's

              here for, and EIA as a demand customer-run

              organization.  I mean, you're sometimes

              measuring your quality by your users.  And

              you're saying we've got to go to our users,

              we've got to go to our users, we've got to

              go to our users.  In some sense that means

              you're driven by a customer base.

                       But at the same time why are you

              here?  And that seems to be primarily to

              advise the government.  I mean, that's why








              you're here.  Those are completely

              different.  That data gets at the users and

              the customer aspect of who you are.

                       It's like there are these

              competing things when you're going to talk

              about whether we should get rid of this.  I

              mean, it could be that this is absolutely

              your most popular survey but absolutely

              useless, never used by the people who

              actually created you.

                       I don't know but those two things

              seem to be not really in conflict so much

              as we'll talk about one in one session, and

              in another session we'll look at it in a

              completely different way.

                       I'm always a bit confused as to

              that.  Where should you be looking?  Should

              it matter at all what your users are?  You

              seem to care a lot and I think some of us

              are users.  I'm not a big user.  So you do

              care about users but at the same time I'm

              not entirely sure that that's really your








              mandated role.  I don't know.

                       MS. FORSYTH:  Well, you could

              elicit the utility functions.  You could go

              that far.  I mean, maybe that's not a big

              deal.  If you know in each sector who

              important users are so who the important

              government users are and who the important

              nongovernment users are, I mean, that would

              be fun.

                       DR. SITTER:  But you can see even

              this discussion raises self-analysis issues

              which you're going to have to face if you

              actually face budget cuts.  Some of the

              questions you're asking us are more like

              who is EIA.  What Mark was saying, what is

              the end product you want to deliver.  If

              you step even more above that it's like who

              are you.  Why do you want to deliver this?

              Is it because the President of the United

              States says I want to deliver this?  Not

              really.  You're allowing yourself to be

              driven by a market in some way and I'm not








              sure which part of the market is most

              important to you.

                       MS. KHANNA:  I feel that's a

              really good question because that goes back

              to the point about is this is my budget

              this is what I can do.  Take it or leave

              it.  Who makes that decision?  If it's a

              government agency if they're going to go

              from their perspective then you're losing

              your other end users.

                       DR. SITTER:  I think that it comes

              down to a US lobby system.  It's more

              complicated than that because if it were

              just who directly uses it there that would

              be one thing.  But you know that if you

              take away somebody, a very powerful segment

              of the industry that wants this data, they

              will come at you through the people that

              can affect your budget.  You know that

              better than I do.

                       But I think that this notion of

              who is your market and who are the








              important ones is going to have to be a

              major decision.  Then you can put some

              utility on it and categorize, put a score,

              if you like, on different aspects of the

              data and say to yourself okay, should we

              reduce quality here, should we eliminate

              this, and so forth.

                       If you ask us specific points

              you're probably going to get the wrong

              answer because, I mean, this whole issue of

              greatest latest versus citation gave you a

              very good example of that because you

              talked to everybody else.  Nobody talked

              about the fact that we'll be happy if it's

              three months old as long as we can go back

              and cite it.  So, clearly, we're not the

              same group you're dealing with out there.

              If you look at specifics we may not be able

              to give you the answer that's correct for

              the decisions you're making on that kind of

              specifics.

                       DR. HENGARTNER:  It seems that








              there's definitely material for a session

              on this next time.

                       MS. FORSYTH:  This might be off

              target but it seems like part of what you

              need, and I don't know whether this group

              is the right place or not, but part of what

              you need is a strategy for mapping what's

              important in those two domains, and maybe

              there are more than two domains, and

              figuring out where they overlap because

              where they overlap is maybe the place where

              you can do the most good with limited

              budgets.  I'm not a quantitative type but

              there are probably models for that kind of

              measurement problem.

                       MR. BREIDT:  Well, I think we'll

              go ahead and adjourn the meeting formally

              now.

                            (Whereupon, at 11:30 a.m.,  the

                            PROCEEDINGS were adjourned.)

                               *  *  *  *  *
