He  led a national campaign to ban the gasoline additive MTBE, and currently  promotes renewable fuels as a near-term strategy to reduce foreign oil  dependence and mitigate climate change. Mr. Coleman served as the Climate  Program Director at Bluewater Network in San    Francisco, and later founded or co-founded several  organizations, including the New Fuels Alliance, the California Renewable Fuels  Partnership, and the Northeast Biofuels Collaborative. He spearheaded an effort  in Massachusetts  to pass the first ever cellulosic ethanol excise tax exemption, and is one of  the leading national advocates for advanced biofuels at the state and federal  level. While studying law, Mr. Coleman worked on several landmark environmental  cases, including the largest ever settlement in Clean Water Act history and a  common-law climate change lawsuit filed on behalf of 11 state attorneys  general. He also serves as the spokesman for FoodPriceTruth.org, a website  devoted to balancing the debate about food versus fuel. </p>
