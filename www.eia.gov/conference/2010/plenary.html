                    <p align="left">                      Dr. Chu has devoted his  recent scientific career to the search for new solutions to our energy  challenges and stopping global climate change &mdash; a mission he continues with  even greater urgency as Secretary of Energy.&nbsp; He is charged with helping  implement President Obama&rsquo;s ambitious agenda to invest in alternative and  renewable energy, end our addiction to foreign oil, address the global climate  crisis and create millions of new jobs.</p>
                    <p align="left">                      Prior to his appointment,  Dr. Chu was director of DOE&rsquo;s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and professor of  Physics and Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California.   He successfully applied the techniques he developed in atomic physics to  molecular biology, and since 2004, motivated by his deep interest in climate  change, he has recently led the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in pursuit of  new alternative and renewable energies. Previously, he held positions at Stanford University and AT&amp;T Bell  Laboratories.</p>
                    <p align="left">                      Professor Chu&rsquo;s research  in atomic physics, quantum electronics, polymer and biophysics includes tests  of fundamental theories in physics, the development of methods to laser cool  and trap atoms, atom interferometry, and the manipulation and study of polymers  and biological systems at the single molecule level.&nbsp; While at Stanford,  he helped start Bio-X, a multi-disciplinary initiative that brings together the  physical and biological sciences with engineering and medicine.</p>
                    <p align="left">                      Secretary Chu is a member  of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the Chinese Academy  of Sciences, Academica Sinica, the Korean   Academy of Sciences and  Technology and numerous other civic and professional organizations.&nbsp; </p>
