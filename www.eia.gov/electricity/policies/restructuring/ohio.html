<p class="Bodypara"><b>
</b><strong>05/08:</strong>&nbsp;  Following up on 2007's announced "Energy, Jobs, and Progress" plan for Ohio, Governor Ted Strickland signed into law Senate Bill 221 (SB 221 or "the Act") on May 1, 2008. Under this new law, the regulatory structure for electric public utility companies is significantly revised and new policies for the development of advanced and renewable energy are put forward.  The new law authorizes The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to establish rules ensuring electric price stability.  Investor-owned utilities (IOUs) will file an Electric Security Plan (ESP).  The electric price established by a PUCO-approved ESP will consider generation and transmission charges as well as the cost for care/maintenance and further development of local distribution infrastructure.  IOUs will have the option to establish electric pricing using a PUCO-approved competitive auction process, known as a Market Rate Offer (MRO).  If the established MRO price is lower than the utility's ESP price, the company can proceed under a PUCO&ndash;approved transition process to the market rate.  The PUCO has authority to test a utility's rate plan to ensure that prices paid by consumers are fair and equitable, as well as check to see if rates are generating excessive earnings for the utility.  The PUCO can order appropriate rate corrections, refunds, or establish new rate plans to correct pricing issues.  Counties, townships and municipalities wanting to establish community aggregation plans for the purchase of electric power have new options that help reduce utility standby charges. More communities could use aggregation to create cost-effective electric rates.  S.B. 221 requires 25 percent of electricity sold by Ohio's IOUs must come from renewable, clean coal and advanced nuclear sources by 2025. At least half of the minimums must be met by renewables and at least half of all power to meet the standard must come from Ohio-based projects.<br>

<p class="Bodypara"><b>08/05:</b>&nbsp; The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) issued a report showing the progress of The Ohio Retail Electric Choice Program.&nbsp; The report covered the progress that had been made in the area of retail choice since 2002.&nbsp; Key developments were as follows:</p>
<p class="Bodypara">• In the residential market, the megawatthours (MWh) sold by
  alternative electric suppliers grew from 60 to 73 percent in the Cleveland
  Electric Illuminating Company territory, from 36 to 43 percent in the Toledo
  Edison Company territory, from 22 to 30 percent in the Ohio Edison company
  territory, and from 2 to 5 percent in the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company
  territory.<br>
  • In the commercial market, the MWh sold by alternative electric
  suppliers grew from 50 to 61 percent in the Cleveland Electric Illuminating
  Company territory, from 38 to 42 percent in the Ohio Edison Company territory,
  from 32 to 38 percent in the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company territory, and
  from 9 to 19 percent in the Dayton Power and Light Company. These numbers
  dropped slightly from 51 to 49 percent in the Toledo Edison Company territory
  and from 6 to 4 percent in the Columbus Southern Power Company territory.<br>
  • In the industrial market, the MWh sold by alternative electric
  suppliers grew from 28 to 64 percent in the Dayton Power and Light Company
  territory, from 18 to 20 percent in the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company
  territory, from 9 to 18 percent in the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company
  territory, and 4 to 5 percent in the Toledo Edison Company territory. This
  number dropped slightly from 32 to 29 percent in the Ohio Edison Company
  territory.<br>

<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/03:&nbsp; </b>The Ohio Consumers’ Counsel (OCC) published its 2002
  End-of-Year Update on Ohio’s Electric Market that reviewed the past two years
  of competition in Ohio. According to the report, “813,000 residential consumers
  statewide – or about 20 percent of those who were eligible to participate in
  electric choice-actually switched electric suppliers.”
  Most of those customers participated in community aggregation groups. At the time, Cleveland
  Electric Illuminating had the highest percentage
  of customers who switched to an alternative
  supplier.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>10/02: &nbsp;</b>The Public Utilities Commission received Dayton Power &amp;
  Light’s proposal to extend its current generation rate freeze from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2005.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>10/02:&nbsp; </b>Dominion Retail Inc., a licensed retail electric supplier
  by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, was offering one-year contracts to
  residential customers of Cinergy’s Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company’s
  (CG&amp;E). The contracts were proposed to end in December 2003, but the offer would
  expire on November 29, 2002. Dominion’s limited time offer was for 4.70 cents per
  kilowatt-hour, which was approximately 10 percent below CG&amp;E’s current
  price to compare of 5.22 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>09/02:&nbsp; </b>The Ohio Consumers' Counsel along with the Industrial
  Energy Users - Ohio and the American Municipal Power - filed a complaint
  against Dayton Power and Light for violating the Electric Choice Law. According
  to an OCC press release, &quot;DP&amp;L had failed to comply with a PUCO
  order to transfer operational control of its electric transmission facilities
  to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) - approved Regional Transmission Organization.&quot; These organizations filed
  a similar complaint against American Electric Power (AEP) in June 2002.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>07/02:&nbsp; </b>The Ohio Consumers' Council (OCC) released its
  &quot;Summer 2002 Electric Market Update,&quot; which stated that
  &quot;progress towards meaningful electric choice for the state's residential
  consumers had begun to stall.&quot; In central and southern Ohio, two competitive residential suppliers existed until New
  Power declared bankruptcy. The other supplier at the time, an affiliate of
  FirstEnergy, &quot;has restricted its activity to FirstEnergy's traditional service territory in
  northern Ohio.&quot;
  Many Ohio residential customers did not have the opportunity to
  participate in retail competition, and community aggregation had been the primary
  option.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>06/02:&nbsp; </b>The PUCO issued their first quarter &quot;switching
  statistics,&quot; summaries of electric customer
  choice switch rates in terms of sales and customers, for 2002. In terms of
  customers, 52.58 percent of residential Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company
  customers switched to a certified retail electric supplier (CRES) while 18.36
  percent of commercial and 24.34 percent of industrial customers switched.
  Toledo Edison Company had 45.84 percent of residential customers, 3.43 percent
  of commercial customers, and 20.66 percent of industrial customers switch to a
  CRES. Ohio Edison Company had 16.43 percent of residential customers, 8.54
  percent of commercial customers, and 30.90 percent of industrial customers
  switch to a CRES. Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, Columbus Southern Power
  Company, and Dayton Power and Light Company had less than 1 percent switch to a
  CRES. No Monongahela Power Company or Ohio Power Company customers were participating
  in the Ohio Electric Choice program at the time.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>06/02:&nbsp; </b>According to a press release, Allegheny Energy Supply, a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc.,
  sold &quot;approximately 45,000 residential and commercial accounts in
  FirstEnergy's northern Ohio service territory&quot; to Dominion Retail, Inc., a
  subsidiary of Dominion. Dominion Retail would replace Allegheny Energy Supply
  as the customers' certified retail electric supplier, but customers &quot;would
  continue to receive one bill from their local utility.&quot;</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>06/02:&nbsp; </b>The Triad Research Group completed its 2002 Research
  Report for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio as part of the Ohio Electric
  Choice campaign. According to this annual market survey, customers were more
  supportive and knowledgeable of electric choice because of the increase in
  advertising. However, customers were less interested and concerned about the “reliability of electric service.” Of the
  customers surveyed, “only 5.1% reported switching suppliers, while one-quarter
  (25.9%) had decided to not switch.”</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>04/02:&nbsp; </b>The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) released
  The Ohio Retail Electric Choice Programs Report of Market Activity for the Year
  2001 to the Ohio General Assembly. The report summarized &quot;the market
  activity during the first year of Ohio's retail
  electric choice program.&quot; According to the report, the Cleveland Electric
  Illuminating Company had 50 percent of its customers switch to alternative
  suppliers. 15 percent of Ohio Edison's customers switched, and over 4 percent of
  Toledo Edison's customers chose another electric supplier. While Cincinnati Gas
  and Electric, Columbus Southern Power, Dayton Power and Light had less than
  1 percent of its customers switch. No Monongahela Power or Ohio Power customers
  switched during 2001.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/02:&nbsp; </b>The Ohio Consumers' Counsel released the first
  report card for Ohio's
  electric choice program. Overall, the OCC said electric customers were
  &quot;better off than they were before electric choice.&quot; About 15 percent
  of eligible customers switched electric suppliers in 2001, mainly former
  customers of the three FirstEnergy companies. In northern Ohio, 158 communities
  aggregated their load and chose an alternative supplier. The counsel
  recommended that the state work out a plan to attract more alternative
  suppliers in less competitive areas of the state; issue competitive bidding
  rules at the end of the transition period; develop more conservation and energy
  efficiency programs and policies; and implement a regional transmission
  organization. On the federal level, the counsel recommended monitoring
  mechanisms to curb market power and guaranteeing adequate wholesale power
  reserves.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>09/01:&nbsp; </b>The PUCO adopted rules for local government aggregation of
  electricity customers. Under Ohio's restructuring legislation passed in July 1999, local
  governments could serve as an aggregator for electricity customers. The new
  rules focused on three issues: Cooperation of the utilities in providing lists
  of the customers in the local government's jurisdiction, forming programs for
  customers to &quot;opt-out&quot; of the aggregation, and the requirements for
  providing customers with written notices of inclusion in the aggregation unless
  the customer specifically &quot;opted-out.&quot;</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/01:&nbsp; </b>Retail direct access to competitive electricity suppliers
  began on January 1, 2001, in the State. The first month saw about 97,622 customers
  in First Energy territories switch suppliers. Standard Offer Rates ranged from
  3.6 to 4.9 cents/kWh in the three FirstEnergy subsidiary territories of Toledo
  Edison, Ohio Edison, and Cleveland Illuminating.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>12/00:&nbsp; </b>Beginning January 1, 2001, Ohio residential, commercial,
  and industrial consumers were scheduled to have access to retail markets for
  electricity. Consumer education programs were available on the Ohio Electric
  Choice web site, through mass mailing by the PUCO,
  and by telephone.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>10/00: &nbsp;</b>Allegheny Energy's (parent of Monongahela Power)
  restructuring plan was approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
  (PUCO). Competition and a 5 percent residential rate reduction were scheduled
  to begin January 1, 2001. Rates would be frozen through the development period,
  which was proposed to be 2003 for large industrial consumers and 2005 for
  residential consumers.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>10/00: &nbsp;</b>American Electric Power's (parent company for Ohio Power
  and Columbus Southern Power) restructuring plan was approved by the PUCO.
  Retail competition was scheduled to begin January 1, 2001, with
  residential consumers receiving a 5 percent rate reduction. More than $600
  million in transition costs were proposed to be collected through 2007 (for Ohio
  Power) and 2008 (for Columbus Southern Power). Certain residential customers would
  have transition charges waived. Also, rates would be frozen through the
  development period or 2005, whichever came first. Shopping credits, incentives
  and switching procedures would also be provided, and AEP agreed to absorb $40
  million of customer education, customer choice implementation, and transition plan
  filing costs.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>10/00: &nbsp;</b>Dayton Power and Light's
  (DP&amp;L) transition plan to begin retail competition for all customers by
  January 2001 was approved by the PUC. Under the agreement, DP&amp;L generation
  rates would be capped until the end of the recovery period when transition
  costs were scheduled to be fully recovered, December 31, 2003. Transmission and
  distribution rates would be capped through the end of 2006. The plan included a
  5 percent residential rate reduction to the generation portion for customers
  who remain with DP&amp;L, beginning January 1, 2001.
  Additionally, DP&amp;L would pay up to $1 million for a voluntary enrollment
  procedure if at least 20 percent of its customers had not chosen another
  supplier by September 30, 2003.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>09/00: &nbsp;</b>The PUCO approved the Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric
  (CG&amp;E) restructuring plan. Retail electric choice was proposed to be
  offered beginning January 1, 2001. The price of electricity would be unbundled into its
  components (generation, transmission, distribution), and a rate cap would be in
  effect for five years for all residential customers. Additionally, residential
  customers who stay with their current supplier would receive a 5 percent rate
  reduction in the generation portion of their bill.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>07/00:&nbsp; </b>An agreement was reached on AEP's transition plan.
  Transition costs recovery would be limited through 2007 for Ohio Power
  consumers and 2008 for Southern Power consumers. Distribution rates would also be
  frozen for the recovery period for residential consumers.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>07/00: &nbsp;</b>First Energy's (Ohio Edison, Toledo Edison, and The
  Illuminating Company) restructuring plan was approved by the PUCO. The plan
  called for recovery of transition costs through 2006 for Ohio Edison, mid-2007
  for Toledo Edison, and 2008 for Illuminating Company. Competition was scheduled
  to begin January 1, 2001, and residential consumers would receive a 5 percent rate
  reduction on the generation portion. Distribution rates were scheduled to be
  frozen through 2007.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>07/00:&nbsp; </b>Allegheny Energy reached a settlement on its transition
  plan. The plan called for recovery of up to $6.3 million in stranded costs,
  5-percent rate reductions for residential consumers, and a 3-year rate freeze
  for industrial and commercial consumers.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>07/00:&nbsp; </b>Monongahela Power reached a settlement on its restructuring
  plan. The plan would shorten the development period for competition for large
  customers to end December 31, 2003, and for small customers, December 31, 2005. Residential customers would
  also receive a 5-percent rate reduction, and rates would then be frozen for the
  remainder of the development period.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/00: &nbsp;</b>AEP (Ohio Power and Columbus Southern Power) filed its
  transition plan with the PUCO. The plan included a requested recovery of $974
  million in regulatory assets.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/00: &nbsp;</b>Monongahela Power filed its transition plan with the PUCO.
  Included was a request for $13 million in stranded cost recovery.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/00: &nbsp;</b>Cincinnati Gas &amp;
  Electric filed its transition plan with the PUCO. The plan included: 5 percent
  residential rate reduction in the generation portion of rates, effective
  January 2001; rate unbundling into the generation, transmission, distribution,
  and transition costs components; recovery of $927 million in transition and
  stranded costs; corporate separation of regulated and unregulated functions; participation
  in the MidWest ISO; and a consumer education plan. The PUCO was scheduled to rule
  on the plan before Oct. 31, 2000.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/00: &nbsp;</b>Dayton Power &amp; Light
  filed its transition plan with the PUCO. The plan included a 5 percent
  residential rate reduction for generation; a cap on all prices through December
  31, 2004; customer choice by January 1, 2001; recovery of $441 million in
  transition costs; and a consumer education program. The PUCO was scheduled to issue
  comments and recommendations related to the plan within 90 days, and a final
  order within 275 days.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>01/00: &nbsp;</b>First Energy (Ohio Edison, The Illuminating Company, and Toledo
  Edison) refiled a transition plan with the PUCO to conform to the new rules
  established to comply with Ohio’s restructuring law. The plan included: &nbsp;requested
  recovery of $7 billion for transition and stranded costs; operational and
  technical support changes to allow for retail direct access by January 1, 2001; plans to
  transfer control of transmission assets to the Alliance RTO; unbundled prices; corporate
  separation of regulated and unregulated business; and an education program for consumers.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>10/99: &nbsp;</b>The PUCO issued an initial set of rules for transition to a
  competitive retail market. The draft rules included provisions for recovery of
  stranded costs, corporate unbundling, consumer education, and employee
  protections.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>10/99:&nbsp; </b>FirstEnergy filed a restructuring plan with the PUCO. The
  plan included passing $6.9 billion to customers over 8 years, but said bills would
  not increase over the transition period. Three separate plans were filed for
  its subsidiary utilities: Ohio Edison, Illuminating Co., and Toledo Edison.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>07/99: &nbsp;</b>The restructuring legislation, Senate Bill 3, was signed
  into law by the governor on July 6, 1999. The legislation would allow retail customers to choose
  their energy suppliers beginning January 1,
  2001. The new law required 5 percent
  residential rate reductions and a rate freeze for 5 years, contains consumer
  protections, environmental provisions, and labor protections, and empowers the
  PUCO to determine the amount and recovery period for stranded costs. Also, the
  property tax utilities paid in the past was replaced with an excise tax on
  consumer bills. Utilities were required to spend $30 million over the next six
  years on consumer education programs.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>06/99:&nbsp; </b>The restructuring legislation would allow retail customers
  to choose their energy suppliers beginning January 1, 2001.&nbsp; It also
  would require a 5 percent residential rate reduction and a rate freeze for 5
  years.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>08/98:&nbsp; </b>A lawsuit aimed at blocking conjunctive service regulations was thrown out
  of court. Because of this, the PUCO would move ahead with plans for a conjunctive
  billing service.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>06/98:&nbsp; </b>The PUCO approved Monongahela's tariff for conjunctive
  electric service, the first tariff approved that would allow groups of
  consumers to aggregate and negotiate the price for electricity.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>12/97:&nbsp; </b>Stranded costs were addressed in the report issued by the co-chairs of the
  Legislative Joint Committee on Electric Deregulation. The plan allowed for
  recovery of stranded costs using nonbypassable wires charges. Utilities would
  be allowed during the 5-year transition period beginning January 2000 and
  ending December 2004 to receive “transition revenues” or stranded costs under
  certain conditions, but would likely expect less than 100 percent of recovery.</p>
<p class="Bodypara"><b>12/96:&nbsp; </b>The PUCO adopted guidelines for Conjunctive Electric Services. The 2-year
  pilot program would allow ratepayers to band together for collective billing
  under rates designed for the group. (The pilot was an experiment in innovative
  pricing, and did not allow for retail wheeling.)</p></td></tr></table>
