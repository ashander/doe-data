         <h2>Form EIA-923 Detailed Data – 2012 and 2015 Data Re-release</h2> 
     <h3>November 30, 2016</h3>
<ul>
<li>The 2015 EIA-923 data file was revised to correct the double-counting of natural gas generation between two plants in Texas.  The original data files overstated Texas natural gas generation by approximately 1.6% and total U.S. natural gas generation by 0.3%.  This revised data file corrects this error by revising the data in the tab for Schedules 3A and 5A.</li><br />

<li>The 2012 EIA-923 data file was also revised to correct state plant locations that were in error.  These revisions were done to correct instance where a plant was incorrectly coded as being in one state but actually was in another state.  As a result, total generation and generation from wood and wood derived fuels was revised for Maine and Massachusetts, total generation and hydroelectric generation was revised for Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Vermont, and total generation and wind generation was revised for Minnesota and South Dakota.  These revisions are only at the state-level and do not affect national total generation nor generation by fuel type.  This revised data file corrects this error by revising the data in the tab for Schedules 3A and 5A.</li>
