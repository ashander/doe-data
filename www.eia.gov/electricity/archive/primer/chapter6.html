    <br><br>
    When fossil fuels are burned in the production of electricity, a variety of gases and particulates are formed. If these gases and particulates are not captured by some pollution control
     equipment, they are released into the atmosphere. This section provides a brief summary of the
     gaseous emissions from U.S. electric utilities and the methods employed to reduce or eliminate
     their release into the atmosphere.
     <p >Among the gases emitted during the burning of fossil fuels are <b>sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and carbon
     dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</b> Coal-fired generating units produce more <b>
     SO<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>NO<sub>x</sub></b> than other fossil-fuel units for two reasons.
     First, because coal generally contains more sulfur than other fossil fuels, it creates more
     SO<sub>2</sub> when burned. Second, there are more emissions from coal-fired plants because
     more coal-fired capacity is used compared with other fossil-fueled capacity.</p><br>

        <p ><b>Sulfur</b> is an element that is present in
        almost all coal, although some kinds of coal contain more sulfur than others depending on
        the geographic location of the coal mine and the type of coal being mined. Western coal has
        less sulfur than eastern coal. More than one-half of the coal mined in the West is
        subbituminous coal that is low in sulfur content (about 0.5 percent) and contains
        approximately 9,000 Btu per pound. Bituminous eastern coal can exceed both a 5-percent
        sulfur content and a heat content of 12,000 Btu per pound. The average percent of sulfur
        contained in coal ranges from 0.3 percent in the West to approximately 2.5 percent in the
        East. During combustion, the sulfur combines with the oxygen in the air to form
        SO<sub>2</sub> . As the SO<sub>2</sub> mixes further with oxygen and trace substances in
        the air, a variety of sulfate compounds emerges. How these transformations take place, and
        in what proportions, is a subject of vigorous research. The behavior of SO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions depends partly on the type of coal used and how it is burned. In addition, the
        presence of light, moisture, and other pollutants in the atmosphere may also be important
        in triggering the complex changes that SO<sub>2</sub> emissions undergo. To a lesser
        degree, sulfur is also contained in petroleum and varies according to the type of petroleum
        (for example, light oil, heavy oil, etc.). Petroleum burned at utility power plants ranges
        from containing almost no sulfur to about 3.5 percent sulfur. The weighted average percent
        of sulfur contained in petroleum consumed by utility plants ranges from about .5 percent in
        western plants to about 1.4 percent for plants in New England. The amount of sulfur
        contained in natural gas is insignificant.</p>

        <p><b>Nitrogen</b> is a colorless,
        odorless gas that makes up about 78 percent of the atmosphere. Nitrogen in the atmosphere
        during the combustion process (burning of fuels at the plant) combines with oxygen and
        water to form several NO<sub>x</sub> compounds. Also, a small amount of nitrogen in the
        coal is converted to NO<sub>x</sub> . The most important is nitrogen dioxide, one of the
        compounds that gives photochemical smog its characteristic yellowish-brown color. Only
        about 10 percent of the nitrogen compounds in the air are the result of human activity. The
        rest are formed by natural processes, such as the decay of organic matter. However, since
        the human-made 10 percent is emitted mostly in industrial urban areas, concentration there
        can become high enough to cause concern. SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> are called
        precursors to acid deposition, because, under the right set of conditions, they react with
        other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively.
        These two acids do not accumulate in the atmosphere, but are absorbed by rain droplets,
        thus cleansing the atmosphere but discharging the acid onto the earth in the form of "acid
        rain." In addition, sulfuric acid may form microscopic droplets that can be deposited
        directly onto the ground. This form of deposition, as well as the direct capture of
        SO<sub>2</sub> by vegetation, is referred to as dry deposition.</p>

        <p ><b>Carbon Dioxide</b> is a
        colorless, odorless, nontoxic gas formed by the combustion of carbon and carbon compounds
        found in coal, petroleum, and gas. Currently, the only way to limit the emission of
        CO<sub>2</sub> when burning fossil fuels is extremely expensive. CO<sub>2</sub> is normally
        removed from the atmosphere by green plants and absorbed by the ocean. The increased use of
        fossil fuels in recent years, as well as extensive deforestation, has caused a buildup of
        CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. This increase of CO<sub>2</sub> causes the atmosphere to
        absorb infrared radiation reflected from the earth that would otherwise have been
        dissipated into space. This phenomenon could increase average global temperature. It is
        called the "greenhouse" effect because it is similar to the trapping of the sun energy in a
        greenhouse. These potential increases in temperatures are of concern because they could
        cause significant climatic changes, shifts in agricultural zones, and partial melting of
        the polar ice caps resulting in flooding of coastal areas. However, significant
        uncertainties exist regarding global warming, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding
        future warming based on past temperature records. Efforts are underway to determine what
        methods can be employed to reduce or eliminate the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from power
        plants. Tail gas cleanup (CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbing) is currently the only technological
        option. This option would require the adaptation by the electric utility industry of acid
        gas removal technologies used by the petroleum and petrochemical industries. Because of the
        potential expense involved and the uncertainty concerning the impacts of emissions from the
        gas, no emission standards or required reductions exist. Additionally, the Department of
        Energy is developing clean coal technologies (such as pressurized fluidized-bed combustion)
        for new plants and repowering applications. Due to the increased conversion efficiencies of
        these technologies, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced.</p>

       <b>Emission Standards</b>
   <p>
	 To respond to concerns about emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>, as well as
     several other air pollutants, Congress passed the Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1963. It was not
     until 1970, however, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was empowered to set
     enforceable air quality standards. In 1971, this Agency established New Source Performance
     Standards (NSPS) that required coal-fired utility boilers built after August 17, 1971, to emit
     no more than 1.2 pounds of SO<sub>2</sub> per million Btu of heat input. Requirements for
     NO<sub>x</sub> were more complex, with allowable limits ranging from 0.2 pounds per million
     Btu to 0.8 pounds per million Btu, depending on the type of fuel burned and the combustion
     device used. In 1977, Congress amended the CAA to require States to set limits on existing
     sources in regions not attaining goals established in the Act. In 1979, the EPA established
     the Revised New Source Performance Standards (RNSPS). The new standards retain the 1971 NSPS
     of 1.2 pounds of SO<sub>2</sub> per million Btu of heat input, but require SO<sub>2</sub>
     emissions from all new or modified (post 1978) boilers to be reduced by at least 90 percent
     unless 90-percent removal reduces emissions to less than 0.6 pounds per million Btu. If
     emissions fall below that level, reductions between 70 and 90 percent are permitted, depending
     on the sulfur content of the coal. RNSPS for NO<sub>x</sub> are complex and, as with NSPS, set
     limits varying from 0.2 to 0.8 pounds per million Btu, depending on the type of fuel burned
     and combustion device used. RNSPS for NO<sub>x</sub> differ from NSPS in the number of
     categories of combustion into which they are divided. The primary goals of the Clean Air Act
     Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 that affect generators of electricity are a 10-million-ton reduction
     in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions and a 2-million-ton reduction in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from
     1980 levels. The reduction in SO<sub>2</sub> is to occur in two phases, one that began in 1995
     and one beginning in 2000.</p><br>
     
    
       <b>Emission Reductions</b>
      
      <p><b>Sulfur Dioxide.</b> One method 
        available to reduce the SO<sub>2</sub> emitted when burning coal is to 
        switch to a coal that has a lower sulfur content. Emissions of sulfur 
        dioxide may also be reduced by using less polluting fuels, particularly 
        gas. Another approach is to install equipment designed to remove SO<sub>2</sub> 
        from the gas (flue gas) released through the flues of the plant. Additional 
        methods for reducing emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>, which include converting 
        boilers to the fluidized-bed combustion process and employing the technology 
        of integrated-gasification combined cycle, are currently under study and 
        not in extensive use.</p>
     <p></p>
     <p>
      <p ><b>Nitrogen Oxides.</b> Formation of
      NO<sub>x</sub> is less dependent on what type of fuel is burned than on how the fuel is
      burned. Apart from the nitrogen content of the fuel, the extent of nitric-oxide formation
      depends primarily on the combustion temperature. NO<sub>x</sub> emissions can be reduced by
      low excess-air firing; low-combustion temperatures; use of low-nitrogen fuels (such as
      natural gas and light distillate oil); staged combustion in which localized fuel-rich
      conditions are created where both thermal and fuel NO<sub>x</sub> are minimized; and use of
      low- NO<sub>x</sub> burners and fluidized-bed combustion.</font></p>
     <p></p>
    <br>
     <b>Environmental Equipment</b>
      <p >While not the only kind of environmental
      equipment installed at power plants, flue gas desulfurization units, particulate collectors,
      and cooling towers are the most significant. In a flue gas desulfurization unit (scrubber),
      the gases resulting from combustion are passed through tanks containing a material that
      captures and neutralizes the SO<sub>2</sub>. Particulate matter is most frequently removed
      from the combustion gases by either filtering (a series of filter bags that trap the ash and
      dust much as a household vacuum cleaner does) in a baghouse or with an electrostatic
      precipitator. In the latter, the particulates are given an electric charge and collected.
      Particulate collection is mainly centered on coal combustion because of the large percentage
      of ash that coal contains. Petroleum has very little ash, and natural gas has practically
      none. For a fossil-fueled steam-electric generating unit, about two-thirds of the heat
      produced by burning the fuel is released to the environment, and only about one-third is used
      to produce electricity. Most waste heat (contained in the cooling water) is dissipated into a
      body of water, such as a river, lake, or bay. Cooling towers are installed where there is
      insufficient cooling water and where the waste heat discharged into the cooling water affects
      plants or marine life. A cooling tower is a structure for transferring heat in the water to
      the atmosphere. The most common type is the wet tower, also called the evaporative tower. In
      a wet tower, cooling is caused mainly by evaporation of the water and partly by direct-heat
      transfer. Environmental equipment can represent a significant part of the cost of a power
      plant. This cost includes the initial capital cost of installation and the recurring
      operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Capital costs are given as a cost per kilowatt of
      installed nameplate capacity.></p>
