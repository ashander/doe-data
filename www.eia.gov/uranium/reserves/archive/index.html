      <p><b>Uranium Reserves Estimates</b></p>
      <p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has reported the estimates 
      for U.S. uranium ore reserves annually for the period 1984-2003. The 
      estimates for U.S. ore reserves will not be provided for 2004. The 
      estimates for yearend 2003 are shown below. Until further notice, the 
      estimates of U.S. uranium ore reserves will not be updated annually 
      pending completion of a review of the EIAs uranium resource assessment 
      effort.</p>
         
          <p><b>Estimation Procedures, 1984-2003</b></p>
      <p>The U.S. uranium ore reserves reported annually by the EIA for specific 
      maximum forward-cost (MFC) categories represent the sums of quantities 
      estimated to occur in known deposits on properties where data about the 
      ore grade, configuration, and depth indicate that the quantities estimated 
      could be recovered at or less than the stated costs given current mining 
      and milling technology and regulations. The reserves estimates for 
      December 31, 2003, are based on historical data for uranium properties 
      evaluated under prior Federal uranium resource assessment programs and 
      data reported for 1984-2003 by mining companies for domestic uranium 
      properties, together covering about 800 individual properties. Data for 
      current mining costs are not available for most of the uranium reserves 
      properties included in the yearend 2003 National estimate, and the 
      reserves quantities reported for the stated MFC categories should be 
      viewed as the upper limits of quantities recoverable under the most 
      favorable conditions. The uranium property reserves estimates were based 
      on bore hole radiometric data validated by chemical analysis of samples 
      from cores and drill cuttings. The thickness of mineralized rock, mineral 
      grades and their spatial distribution, host-rock depth, proposed mining 
      method, ore haulage distance, and reclamation method were considered in 
      the reserves evaluation. Ore cut-off grades reflect operating costs only, 
      and the estimates include only ore with an average grade expected to allow 
      recovery of the forward costs.
      
      <p>Only forward operating and capital costs were used to estimate reserves. Past 
capital costs were considered "sunk" costs and mining of the individual deposits 
may or may not return such costs. Sunk costs for such items as exploration and 
land acquisition were excluded as were the costs for income taxes, profit, and 
the cost of money. Forward costs include the costs for power and fuel, labor, 
materials, royalties, insurance, severance and ad valorem taxes, and applicable 
administrative costs. The forward costs used to estimate U.S. uranium ore 
reserves are categorically independent of the price at which uranium produced 
from the estimated reserves might be sold in the commercial market.</p>
<p>The estimates do not reflect a predetermined profit margin above the basic 
costs, since the rate of return can differ considerably among individual mining 
companies. Therefore, the National estimates could include some reserves across 
the MFC categories that might not be exploitable if the profit margin ceases to 
be attractive to the operator. Reserves quantities reported by the EIA have been 
adjusted to reflect effects of mining dilution and milling and processing 
recovery factors. The 2003 estimates and historical estimates of the annual U.S. 
uranium reserves since 1993 are shown. The 2003 reserves estimates for the $30- 
and the $50-per-pound U3O8 categories are summarized for major uranium-industry 
States.</p>
