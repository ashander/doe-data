<item><title>Tight oil expected to make up most of U.S. oil production increase through 2040</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29932</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Mon, 13 Feb 2017) EIA’s recently released &amp;lt;em>Annual Energy Outlook 2017&amp;lt;/em> (AEO2017) Reference case projects that U.S. tight oil production will increase to more than 6 million barrels per day (b/d) in the coming decade, making up most of total U.S. oil production. After 2026, tight oil production remains relatively constant through 2040 in the Reference case as tight oil development moves into less productive areas and as well productivity decreases.</description></item><item><title>Drilling Productivity Report</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Mon, 13 Feb 2017) EIA’s monthly Drilling Productivity Report (DPR) has been released. The DPR takes a fresh look at oil and natural gas production, starting with an assessment of how and where drilling for hydrocarbons is taking place. It uses recent data on the total number of drilling rigs in operation along with estimates of drilling productivity and estimated changes in production from existing oil and natural gas wells to provide estimated changes in oil and natural gas production for seven key fields.</description></item><item><title>Domestic Uranium Production Report – Quarterly</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/uranium/production/quarterly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Fri, 10 Feb 2017) Fourth quarter 2016 update of uranium production in the United States and operating status of U.S. uranium mills and plants.</description></item><item><title>Argentina seeking increased natural gas production from shale resources to reduce imports</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=29912</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Fri, 10 Feb 2017) Despite its estimated 802 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of unproved, technically recoverable shale gas resources, Argentina’s dry natural gas production declined each year from 2006 to 2014, and the country has shifted from a net exporter of natural gas to a net importer.</description></item><item><title>Quarterly Coal Distribution Report – Third Quarter 2016</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/coal/distribution/quarterly/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Thu, 09 Feb 2017) Provides detailed U.S. domestic coal distribution data for July – September 2016, excluding waste coal and imports, by coal origin, coal destination, mode of transportation, and consuming sector. Quarterly coal distribution data for all years are preliminary and will be superseded by the release of the corresponding “Annual Coal Distribution Report.” </description></item><item><title>Quarterly Coal Report,  July – September 2016 </title><link>http://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Thu, 09 Feb 2017) U.S. coal production during third quarter 2016 totaled 195.1 million short tons. This was 21.6% higher than the previous quarter and 17.6% lower than third quarter 2015.  Third quarter 2016 U.S. coal exports (12.6 million short tons) decreased 11.3% from second quarter 2016 and decreased 26.0% from third quarter 2015.  U.S. coal imports in third quarter 2016 totaled 2.7 million short tons.  All data for 2015 and prior years are final.  All data for 2016 are preliminary.</description></item><item><title>U.S. energy trade with Mexico: U.S. export value more than twice import value in 2016</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=29892</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Thu, 09 Feb 2017) Energy trade between Mexico and the United States has historically been driven by Mexico’s sales of crude oil to the United States and by U.S. net exports of refined petroleum products to Mexico.</description></item><item><title>Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey: Water Consumption in Large Buildings, 2012</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/water/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Thu, 09 Feb 2017) Using water consumption data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), EIA estimates that the 46,000 large commercial buildings (greater than 200,000 square feet) used about 359 billion gallons of water (980 million gallons per day) in 2012. On average, these buildings used 7.9 million gallons per building, 20 gallons per square foot, and 18,400 gallons per worker in 2012. The types of buildings that are the most intensive water users are inpatient healthcare buildings, public order and safety buildings (which include prisons) and lodging buildings (which include hotels). For the second time in its history, EIA has collected water usage data through the CBECS.</description></item><item><title>U.S. coal production and coal-fired electricity generation expected to rise in near term</title><link>http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29872</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Wed, 08 Feb 2017) Coal production in the United States totaled 739 million short tons (MMst) in 2016, an 18% decline from 2015 and the lowest level of coal production since 1978. Because nearly all coal produced in the United States is used to generate electricity, coal production and coal-fired electricity generation are closely connected. </description></item><item><title>Short-Term Energy Outlook </title><link>http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2017 00:00:00 EST</pubDate><description>(Tue, 07 Feb 2017) U.S. crude oil production averaged an estimated 8.9 million b/d in 2016.
