Most of this recovered paper is consumed in the United States, but some is exported.

Crude oil lease stocks refer to oil (currently about 31 million barrels' worth) that is stored in tanks at sites across the United States where producers are drilling on leased land.

			      <p class="dat"><i>Sep 30, 2016</i><br />
				      It should be noted that several factors influence the source of a company's crude oil imports. For example, a company like Motiva, which is partly owned by Saudi Refining Inc., would be expected to import a large percentage from the Persian Gulf, while Citgo Petroleum Corporation, which is owned by the Venezuelan state oil company, would not be expected to import a large percentage from the Persian Gulf, since most of their imports likely come from Venezuela. In addition, other factors that influence a specific company's sources of crude oil imports would include the characteristics of various crude oils as well as a company's economic needs. While, in general, crude oil is fungible, i.e., one crude oil can be substituted for another, many refineries are optimized by refining crude oil with specific qualities (e.g., the API gravity, the amount of sulfur in the crude oil, etc.). Also, depending on the global crude oil market condition at the time, the price difference between heavy and light crude oils varies, thus changing the economic dynamics for different refineries. Therefore, many factors determine the source of a company's crude oil imports. </p>

•	Domestic dry natural gas production of 27.1 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), or 74.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), in 2015 was 4.5% above the 2014 level. For the third consecutive year, Pennsylvania saw the largest total gain in annual production, increasing from 11.56 Bcf/d in 2014 to 13.04 Bcf/d in 2015. Production in Ohio increased the most, percentage-wise, of any state, for the second consecutive year. Dry natural gas production in Ohio rose more than 99%, from 1.31 Bcf/d in 2014 to 2.62 Bcf/d in 2015. 

•	Deliveries to consumers of natural gas in 2015 were a record level of 25.1 Tcf, or 68.6 Bcf/d, an increase of 2.8% from 2014 deliveries.  Deliveries to the electric power sector increased by 18.7% in 2015 to a record level of 26.5 Bcf/d. Deliveries of natural gas used as vehicle fuel also increased (by 11.6%) in 2015. Increases in these two sectors were offset by decreases in deliveries to the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, which dropped by 9.4%, 7.7%, and 1.5%, respectively, from 2014 levels.

•	In 2015, U.S. natural gas imports increased year-to-year for the first time since 2007. Total imports of natural gas in 2015 were 2,718 Bcf, an increase of 0.8% from 2014. Exports of natural gas increased year-to-year for the first time since 2012, from 1,514 Bcf in 2014 to 1,783 Bcf in 2015, an increase of 17.8%.

These revisions primarily apply to statistics on production, underground storage, consumption, and prices by sector. A detailed description of the revisions and benchmarking process is provided in Appendix C of the Natural Gas Monthly.
•	In July 2016, for the fourth consecutive month, dry natural gas production decreased year-to-year from the same month in 2015. Preliminary dry natural gas production for July 2016 was 2,213 billion cubic feet (Bcf), or 71.4 Bcf/day.

•	Preliminary dry natural gas consumption for July 2016 was 2,204 Bcf, or 71.1 Bcf/day. This level was an increase of 6.1%, or 4.1 Bcf/day, from the 2,077 Bcf consumed in July 2015.
•	Year-over-year total consumption of dry natural gas in July increased in all four consuming sectors. Deliveries of natural gas by consuming sector in July 2016 were as follows:
o	Residential deliveries in July 2016 were 108.3 Bcf, or 3.493 Bcf/day, up 0.2% from 3.486 Bcf/day in July 2015. 
o	Commercial deliveries were 136 Bcf, or 4.4 Bcf/day, up 1.5% from 4.3 Bcf/day in July 2015.
o	Industrial deliveries were 624 Bcf, or 20.1 Bcf/day, up 5.2% from 19.1 Bcf/day in July 2015. Industrial deliveries were the highest for the month since EIA began tracking them in 2001.
o	Electric power deliveries were 1,148 Bcf, or 37.0 Bcf/day, up 8.9% from 34.0 Bcf/day in July 2015. Electric power deliveries were the highest for any month since EIA began tracking them in 2001.

				      EIA’s Southern California Daily Energy Report shows how electricity and natural gas are being managed in Southern California following the discovery of the leak at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in October 2015. This dashboard report includes important information about energy operations in Southern California including hourly electric load across Southern California; past actual and near-future forecasts of daily low and high temperatures in Los Angeles; recent daily natural gas receipts and sendout levels; and Southern California daily wholesale on-peak power and natural gas prices. </p>

				      The United States simultaneously imports and exports gasoline because of regional differences in gasoline supply and demand balances. The two regions with the largest supply and demand imbalances are the East Coast, which imported 581,000 barrels per day (b/d) of gasoline in 2015, and the Gulf Coast, which exported 551,000 b/d of gasoline in 2015. </p>
