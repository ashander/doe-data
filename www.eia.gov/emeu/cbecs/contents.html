  <p>National-level estimates for 53 building activity subcategories are now available in five new tables. The CBECS Detailed Tables provide 16 categories for principal building activity, but the CBECS questionnaire actually collects around 100 different building activities. Not all of the subcategories have large enough sample counts to provide statistically significant estimates, but there are 53 subcategories that were already provided in the public use microdata files and are now pretabulated. For characteristics such as building counts, building size, operating hours, and age, see Tables <a href="../../consumption/commercial/data/2012/bc/cfm/pba1.cfm.html">PBA1</a> and <a href="../../consumption/commercial/data/2012/bc/cfm/pba2.cfm.html">PBA2</a>, which are found in the <em>building activity </em>section of the <a href="../../consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.cfm@view=characteristics.html">building characteristics tables</a>.

<p>Additionally, minor revisions have been made to <a href="../../consumption/commercial/data/index.html">Detailed Tables</a> B1, B2, and C4. In B1, the calculation of the <em>mean square feet per worker</em> column was modified to exclude buildings with zero workers; in Table B2, the calculation of the median operating hours per week column was modified to include buildings that were never open; and in Table C4, the calculation of the building-level intensity percentiles were modified to include buildings that do not use any energy.</p>

The <a href="../../consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.cfm@view=consumption.html">2012  CBECS consumption and expenditures detailed tables</a> are comprised of tables  C1-C38, which cover overall electricity, natural gas, fuel oil and  district heat consumption, and tables E1-E11, which disaggregate the same  energy sources by end use (heating, cooling, lighting, etc.). All of the  detailed tables contain extensive row categories of building characteristics.  
  <p>The <a href="../../consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.cfm@view=microdata.html" title="2012 CBECS microdata files">2012 CBECS microdata files</a>&nbsp;now  contain additional variables for energy consumption and expenditures, in total,  by energy source, and by end use.

  <p>There have been some improvements since the 2003 CBECS public use data release. The data file is no longer split up into groups, so one download will provide users with all the CBECS variables. Also, in addition to a CSV (comma delimited) file, the data are also available as a SAS data file. The files contain replicate weights so that data users can calculate standard errors. Detailed examples of how to perform these calculations can be found in an extensive User's Guide. And finally, the CBECS questionnaire has been annotated to be used with the public use files. </p>
  <p>EIA continues to work on processing the consumption and expenditures data. The projected release dates have been adjusted slightly to account for the work remaining. The Energy Supplier Survey (ESS) was conducted between March and October 2014, collecting data from energy providers of buildings in the CBECS for which energy usage data was not obtained from the building respondent. Now the ESS energy usage data is being combined and processed with the energy usage from the building respondents and end use estimates (the amount of energy used for heating, cooling, lighting, etc.) are being modeled.

These tables provide detailed information related to employment;  building ownership and occupancy; energy sources used; and heating, cooling, water heating, lighting, and refrigeration equipment.</p>

It should be noted that all the tables still contain preliminary data and many of the estimates are expected to change slightly when the consumption data are released near the end of this year.</p>

 <p>
EIA is concluding the second and final phase of CBECS data collection, the Energy Supplier Survey (ESS). Since March, EIA has been collecting data from energy providers of buildings in the CBECS for which energy usage data was not obtained from the building respondent. Now the ESS energy usage data will be combined and processed with the energy usage from the building respondents. See <a href="../../consumption/commercial/about.cfm.html">About the CBECS</a> for further description of the two phases of CBECS data collection. </p>
  <p>The <a href="../../consumption/commercial/reports/2012/preliminary/index.cfm.html">2012  CBECS preliminary building characteristics</a> were released in June. This  preliminary data release includes building counts and total square footage by  building activity, Census region and division, and building size category, and  year of construction. </p>
<p>The next release will be the  Building Characteristics Detailed Tables; the tables will be similar to those  published for the 2003 CBECS. We have evaluated the work remaining to ensure  high data quality and adjusted the projected schedule of data releases as shown  below. The Detailed Tables will be released in four groups; the table numbers  shown below correspond to the <a href="../../consumption/commercial/data/2003/index.cfm.html">2003 CBECS tables</a>.  Please note that the table descriptions in the schedule below refer to the data  presented as columns in the tables. Every table will have extensive CBECS data  presented as rows, including building size, activity, occupancy, etc.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="more">
  <p>The active field data collection phase of the 2012 CBECS ended last week. In the next month, home office staff at Westat (the CBECS survey contractor) will continue to work on open cases via telephone interviews. With over 200 interviewers deployed across the U.S. starting in mid-April 2013, the 2012 CBECS was the largest field collection in the 30-year history of CBECS.</p>
  <p>Westat has been transmitting cases to EIA every few weeks since May, and the data editing phase here at EIA is making good progress. We are on track to publish the first characteristics results in late April or early May. The consumption and expenditures data releases will follow in about a year. The Energy Suppliers Survey (ESS) data collection begins in early spring: those data will provide energy usage and cost data for about half the CBECS cases.  </p>

  <p>The CBECS interviewers have been in the field for 3 months now, and they have already collected data for about 4,500 buildings all across the country.</p>
  <p>Back here at EIA, CBECS staff are reviewing the data files as we receive them. The information collected in these interviews has already passed through and cleared two levels of automated data checks. Now, we're checking all the open-ended responses and interviewer comments and running case-level edits that check for item consistency within questionnaires and help to verify that the energy usage data are accurate.  </p>
  <p>We're also gearing up for the CBECS Energy Suppliers Survey (ESS). In this follow-up survey, we will request energy use and cost data directly from the energy suppliers of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, or district energy. ESS data collection is on schedule to begin in early spring 2014. </p>

<h2 class="toggle">The 2012 CBECS is in the field!</h2>  
<div class="more">
  <p>Data collection for the 2012 CBECS began the week of April 15, 2013. About 250 interviewers are visiting buildings across the U.S. to collect data on their structure, operational characteristics, and energy use. In two recent four-day training sessions, the interviewers were thoroughly trained on all the steps necessary to complete an interview: determining if the building is in scope for the survey, making an appointment, gaining cooperation, using the computer to conduct the interview, and scanning utility bills.  </p>
<p>Who are these CBECS interviewers? They are professionals, but usually not energy experts. Many have worked on other large-scale surveys of various topics, while some are new to interviewing. Interviewers are an interesting, diverse group of people from all walks of life. Some of their previous or current other occupations include: accountants, firefighters, social workers, interior designers, caterers, military personnel, teachers, tax preparers, government workers, geological technicians, sales people, certified energy managers, dairy farmers, electrical contractors, DJs, architects, parents, and grandparents. The skills that they all have in common that make them effective interviewers are the ability to talk to respondents, an eye for detail, and a talent for organization.
</p>
<p>At least one interviewer is returning to the CBECS for the third time. After working on the 2003 and the 2007 CBECS, this particular experienced interviewer was happy to be back: "This is my favorite project! I find that the majority of the respondents are cooperative. Many have gotten the Advance Package of materials and are happy to talk about their building."</p>

<p>Data collection will continue for approximately the next 6 months.

  <p>Over 12,000 buildings across the U.S. have been selected to be interviewed (see <a href="../../consumption/commercial/2012-cbecs-building-sampling.cfm.html">How Will Buildings Be Selected for the 2012 CBECS?</a> for more information on sample selection). The CBECS contractor, Westat, is hiring about 300 field interviewers who will visit each of these buildings to determine eligibility for the CBECS. Then they will conduct interviews&mdash;either in-person or by telephone&mdash;using a survey instrument on a laptop computer. See the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/survey/form/eia_871/2012/cbecs-buildings-871a.pdf">final version of the 2012 CBECS questionnaire</a>.</p>
  <p>The CBECS interviewers will be trained in-depth to ensure that high quality data are collected. They will begin their training with distance learning modules to acclimate them with the CBECS and energy concepts before they travel to the in-person training. At the beginning of April, they will attend a four-day in-person training session in Los Angeles where they will learn the ins-and-outs of the CBECS interviewing process and the questionnaire. They will get lots of practice with the survey instrument before they hit the streets as soon as they return home from training.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, back at Westat's home office in Rockville, MD, staff are working hard to make sure the behind-the-scenes logistics are in place. Materials for each case assignment are carefully being put together, including maps and other forms that will allow the interviewer to find the sampled buildings. Each respondent will be provided a package of materials about the CBECS when they are first contacted. Among other items, this package contains worksheets to help the building respondents prepare for the interview and <a href="http://www.eia.gov/survey/form/eia_871/2012/endorsement-insert.pdf">a list of organizations that have encouraged participation in the CBECS </a>.

See <a href="../../consumption/commercial/2012-cbecs-building-sampling.cfm.html">How Will Buildings Be Selected for the 2012 CBECS?</a> for more information on how the sample frame is constructed.  Two training sessions of three and a half days each were held in Bethesda, Maryland from September 6 through September 12, 2012.  About 90 listers from across the U.S. were trained using a mix of classroom education and practice listings around the streets of Bethesda.  They learned all about EIA, the CBECS, and how to canvass their assigned geographic areas to list all CBECS-eligible buildings and record the information that is needed to select the sample of buildings that will be interviewed.</p>
  <p>The field listers' hard work and attention to detail will ensure that the sample frame is accurate and complete.  They are enthusiastic about working on CBECS and ready to begin their assignments.  One field supervisor with many years of experience on various surveys said: "I can't think of a more important study to be working on right now."</p>
  <p>The listing is now underway and will be complete in November 2012.  The sample, significantly larger than previous cycles, will be selected in January 2013 and the interviewing of the sampled buildings will begin in April 2013.</p>

    <p>Following the suspension of the 2011 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) given insurmountable funding constraints in FY 2011, EIA has resumed preparations to conduct the next Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). EIA plans to field the survey in April 2013, collecting data for reference year 2012. EIA expects to publish the first results of the survey in the first half of FY 2014. EIA is now working with stakeholders to develop the survey instrument. EIA will provide regular project status reports to the public throughout the course of the project.</p>
    <p>EIA previously reported that the CBECS 2007 data do not meet EIA standards for quality, credible energy information. As a result, EIA will not publish complete data tables from CBECS 2007 or release a public use file. EIA's status reports for CBECS 2012 will report on risk mitigation strategies undertaken to assure the delivery of CBECS 2012 data.</p>
