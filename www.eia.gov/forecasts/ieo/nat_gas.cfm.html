        <h1>Chapter 3. Natural gas</h1>
        <div align="right"><a class="ico_pdf" href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/nat_gas.pdf"> print version</a></div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Consumption of natural gas worldwide is projected to  increase from 120 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2012 to 203 Tcf in 2040 in the <em>International Energy Outlook 2016 </em>(IEO2016)  Reference case. By energy source, natural gas accounts for the largest increase  in world primary energy consumption. Abundant natural gas resources and robust  production contribute to the strong competitive position of natural gas among  other resources. Natural gas remains a key fuel in the electric power sector  and in the industrial sector. In the power sector, natural gas is an attractive  choice for new generating plants because of its fuel efficiency. Natural gas  also burns cleaner than coal or petroleum products, and as more governments  begin implementing national or regional plans to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2)  emissions, they may encourage the use of natural gas to displace more  carbon-intensive coal and liquid fuels.</p>
<p>World consumption of natural gas for industrial uses  increases by an average of 1.7%/year, and natural gas consumption in the  electric power sector increases by 2.2%/year, from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case. The industrial and electric power sectors together account for  73% of the total increase in world natural gas consumption, and they account  for about 74% of total natural gas consumption through 2040.</p>
<p>Consumption of natural gas increases in every  IEO region, with demand in nations outside the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) increasing more than twice as fast as in  the OECD (Figure 3-1). The strongest growth in natural gas consumption is  projected for the countries of non-OECD Asia, where economic growth leads to  increased demand. Natural gas consumption in the non-OECD region grows by an  average of 2.5%/year from 2012 to 2040, compared with 1.1%/year in the OECD  countries. As a result, non-OECD countries account for 76% of the total world  increment in natural gas consumption, and their share of world natural gas use grows  from 52% in 2012 to 62% in 2040.</p>

      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-1_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
<p>To  meet the rising natural gas demand projected in the IEO2016 Reference case, the  world&rsquo;s natural gas producers increase supplies by nearly 69% from 2012 to  2040. The largest increases in natural gas production from 2012 to 2040 occur  in non-OECD Asia (18.7 Tcf), the Middle East (16.6 Tcf), and the OECD Americas  (15.5 Tcf) (Figure 3-2). In China alone, production increases by 15.0 Tcf as  the country expands development of its shale resources. The United States and  Russia increase natural gas production by 11.3 Tcf and by 10.0 Tcf,  respectively. In Russia, production growth is supported primarily by increasing  development of resources in the country&rsquo;s Arctic and eastern regions. U.S.  production growth comes mainly from shale resources. Total natural gas production  in China, the United States, and Russia accounts for nearly 44% of the overall increase  in world natural gas production.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-2.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-2.png" alt="Figure 3-2. World increase in natural gas production by country grouping, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-2_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
<p>Although  there is more to learn about the extent of the world&rsquo;s tight gas, shale gas,  and coalbed methane resource base, the IEO2016 Reference case projects a  substantial increase in those supplies&#8212;especially in China, the United States,  and Canada (Figure 3-3). The application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  technologies has made it possible to develop the U.S. shale gas resource, contributing  to a near doubling of estimates for total U.S. technically recoverable natural  gas resources over the past decade. Shale gas accounts for more than half of U.S.  natural gas production in the IEO2016 Reference case, and tight gas, shale gas,  and coalbed methane resources in Canada and China account for about 80% of  total production in 2040 in those countries.</p>
  <p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-3.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-3.png" alt="Figure 3-3. Natural gas production by type in China, Canada, and the United States, 2012 and 2040" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-3_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
       
      <p>Liquefied  natural gas (LNG) accounts for a growing share of world natural gas trade in  the Reference case. World LNG trade more than doubles, from about 12 Tcf in  2012 to 29 Tcf in 2040. Most of the increase in liquefaction capacity occurs  in Australia and North America, where a multitude of new liquefaction projects  are planned or under construction, many of which will become operational within  the next decade. At the same time, existing facilities in North Africa and  Southeast Asia have been underutilized or are shutting down because of  production declines at many of the older fields associated with the  liquefaction facilities, and because domestic natural gas consumption is more  highly valued than exports.</p>
      <h2>OECD natural gas consumption</h2>
      <h4>OECD Americas</h4>
<p>Annual natural gas consumption in the OECD  Americas region rises steadily to 40.1 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-4), including  increases of 1.0 Tcf from 2012 to 2020 (0.4%/year) and 7.3 Tcf from 2020 to  2040 (1.0%/year). The OECD Americas region accounts for 41% of the total  increase in natural gas use by OECD countries and 13% of the increase in total world  natural gas consumption over the projection period.</p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-4.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-4.png" alt="Figure 3-4. OECD Americas natural gas consumption by country, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-4_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>The  United States&#8212;the world's largest consumer of natural gas&#8212;leads the OECD  Americas region in annual natural gas consumption growth with an increase of 4.2  Tcf from 2012 to 2040, or 51% of the region&rsquo;s total increase (Figure 3-5). While  the recently finalized Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations in the United States are  not included in the IEO2016 Reference case, its effects are considered in  discussions, tables, and figures throughout the report, based on prior U.S. Energy  Information Administration (EIA) analysis of the proposed rule that has similar  elements. With implementation of the proposed CPP, U.S. natural gas consumption  would be 1.7 Tcf higher in 2020 compared to the IEO2016 Reference case. Most of  the increase in natural gas consumption would occur in the electric power  sector as a substitute for coal-fired generation. After 2020, the effect of the  CPP on natural gas use in the power sector decreases as generation from  renewable energy increases. In 2040, projected U.S. natural gas consumption is  1.0 Tcf lower with the CPP than in the IEO2016 Reference case. Effects of the  final CPP on natural-gas-fired generation will depend on natural gas prices,  renewable technology costs, and state-level implementation decisions. An  increase in natural gas use through 2040 is certainly possible in scenarios  with low gas prices and implementation strategies that favor gas.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-5.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-5.png" alt="Figure 3-5. OECD Americas change in natural gas consumption by country and end-use sector, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-5_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Projections for combined annual natural gas consumption in  Mexico and Chile include absolute growth in the two countries of 2.2 Tcf (26%  of the OECD Americas total increase), followed by Canada with 1.9 Tcf (23% of  the OECD Americas total increase). Increasingly, Mexico has met its growing  demand for electricity with generation from natural gas-fired units, using  natural gas imported by pipeline from the United States, particularly since  2011 as the growth of Mexico&rsquo;s overall natural gas consumption has outstripped  its domestic production growth. In the IEO2016 Reference case, the electric  power sector accounts for 39% (3.2 Tcf) of the growth in natural gas  consumption from 2012 to 2040 in the OECD Americas region, with 1.6 Tcf of the  increase occurring in Mexico and Chile and 1.3 Tcf in Canada.</p>
<p>Natural gas use in the OECD Americas industrial sector grows  by 1.4 Tcf from 2012 to 2020, with 1.3 Tcf (97%) added in the United States,  where industrial consumption increases by an average of 1.8%/year. The growth of  natural gas use in the U.S. industrial sector slows somewhat from 2020 to 2040 averaging  0.5%/year and increasing by a total of 1.0 Tcf over that period. In Canada,  natural gas consumption in the industrial sector grows by an average of 0.2%/year  from 2012 to 2020 and by 1.1%/year from 2020 to 2040. In the Mexico/Chile  region, industrial sector natural gas use grows by averages of 0.1%/year from  2010 to 2020 and 1.2%/year from 2020 to 2040.</p>
<h4>OECD Europe</h4>
<p>Natural gas consumption in the OECD Europe region  grows by 1.3%/year on average, from 17.8 Tcf in 2012 to 25.3 Tcf in 2040 in the  Reference case (Figure 3-6), with the electric power sector accounting for more  than one-half (4.6 Tcf) of the total increase. The average increase of  3.6%/year in natural gas consumption for power generation from 2020 to 2040 is  higher than for any other energy source used in the sector. The share of  natural gas in the power generation mix is projected to grow, as older nuclear and  coal-fired units will be gradually decommissioned and replaced primarily by new  natural gas-fired and renewable capacity.</p>

<div class="tie_correction">
        <h4>Natural gas prices in Asia</h4>
        <p>In  Asian markets, unlike those in the United States, natural gas prices typically  reflect contracts that are indexed to prices for crude oil or petroleum  products. The declines in crude oil prices between August 2014 and January 2015  and low oil prices since then (Figure 3-7) had a significant effect on Asian  natural gas prices and markets. However, Asian countries are developing  regional trading hubs to set natural gas prices that better reflect natural gas  market dynamics. In 2014, almost 30% of global trade in LNG occurred on a  short-term [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#54">54</a>] or spot basis. Asian countries accounted for three-quarters of that total and  one-third of the global natural gas trade [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#55">55</a>].  From 2011 to 2014, high crude oil prices resulted in higher prices for LNG  imports. In Asia, most natural gas is imported as LNG, with LNG prices traditionally  indexed to crude oil on a long-term, contractual basis. </p>
        
        <p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-7.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-7.png" alt="Figure 3-7. World crude oil, natural gas, and liquefied natural gas prices, 2010&#8211;15" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-7_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
     <p>Currently  there is no globally integrated market for natural gas, and pricing mechanisms  vary by regional market. In most cases, internationally traded natural gas is  indexed to crude oil prices, such as North Sea Brent or Japan customs-cleared  crude (JCC), because of the liquidity and transparency of crude oil prices and  the substitutability of natural gas and petroleum products in some markets. For  example, some Asian countries have the option to burn either natural gas or  petroleum for electricity generation.</p>
<p>Although long-term contracts indexed to crude  oil prices remain Asia&rsquo;s predominant pricing mechanism, natural gas is  beginning to be traded in one-time transactions on the spot market, or under  short-term contracts that more closely reflect international natural gas supply  and demand balances. Short-term and spot LNG trade in the Asia Pacific market almost  tripled from 2010 to 2014 (Figure 3-8), when it represented 21% of global LNG  trade and 7% of natural gas trade.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-8.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-8.png" alt="Figure 3-8. Asia Pacific natural gas trade by country and contract type, 2010 and 2014" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-8_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Several  Asian countries&mdash;including Japan, China, and Singapore&#8212;are developing regional  trading hubs with the goal of increasing price formation transparency:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In September 2014, Japan launched an LNG futures  contract on the Japan over-the-counter exchange (JOE), settled against the Rim  Intelligence Co. Daily Pricing Index. However, only one trade has been made on the  JOE since its inception. The country's lack of pipeline connectivity with other  markets, low volumes of flexible LNG, and lack of LNG price transparency and  liquidity have limited spot LNG trading activity on the JOE.</li>
  <li>In June 2015, Singapore's Stock Exchange  launched the Singapore SGX LNG Index Group (SLInG). The index will provide free-on-board  prices (excluding shipping costs) for LNG cargos from Singapore to different  destinations reflecting regional spot prices. As of June 2015, 13 market players  had signed up to participate in the index, and 10 more were expected to join; however,  trading volumes to date have been moderate.</li>
  <li>On July 1, 2015, China launched the Shanghai Oil  and Gas Exchange, which will trade both pipeline gas and LNG. China&rsquo;s  diversified natural gas market, with expanding pipeline infrastructure and  gas-on-gas competition, may offer a more liquid Asian natural gas price index,  but high levels of government regulation make it less attractive as a regional  benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Europe, where natural gas is imported both by  pipeline and as LNG, natural gas prices are either indexed to crude oil prices or  based on the spot market. Although most of trade in Europe is based on  long-term contracts, hub-based spot trading has increased significantly over the past decade. The primary benchmark prices for spot trading are the National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United Kingdom and the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands. The NBP and TTF prices have a strong influence on hub prices in other European markets because of their liquidity and interconnectivity with continental Europe. Other trading hubs in continental Europe are growing in terms of traded volumes and the numbers of hubs and participants. With the increasing volumes and liquidity in the European hubs, hub pricing is beginning to play a larger role. Some recent pipeline contracts in continental Europe now include a hub-based price, rather than a traditional linkage to a basket of crude oil products.</p>
<p>Prices at Henry Hub, the U.S. natural gas benchmark, can also affect global pricing through LNG trade. By 2020, when all current U.S. liquefaction projects are expected to be completed, the United States will account for almost one-fifth of global liquefaction capacity and will have the third-largest LNG export capacity in the world (after Qatar and Australia).</p>
<p>Almost 80% of U.S. LNG export volumes for projects currently under construction have been contracted on pricing terms directly linked to the Henry Hub price, or under a hybrid pricing mechanism with links to Henry Hub. The flexibility of destination clauses in U.S. LNG export contracts and the introduction of hub indexes are expected to promote greater liquidity in global LNG trading, shift pricing away from oil-based indexes, and contribute to the development of Asian regional trading hubs and pricing indexes.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>OECD Asia</h4>
      <p>Natural gas consumption in OECD Asia grows by an average of 1.6%/year  in the IEO2016 Reference case, from 7.9 Tcf in 2012 to 12.2 Tcf in 2040, with  Japan&rsquo;s consumption increasing by an average of 0.9%/year. Japan has relied  primarily on short-term and spot cargo shipments of LNG to offset the loss of  nuclear generating capacity when a large part of its nuclear generation  capacity was shut down after the Fukushima Daiichi power reactors were severely  damaged by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. All but 2 of the country&rsquo;s 50  reactors remained offline as of January 2016 [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#56">56</a>],  and environmental concerns have led the government to encourage natural gas  consumption, making LNG a fuel of choice for power generation to substitute for  the lost nuclear generation. According to the International Gas Union, Japan  operated 23 major LNG import terminals in 2014, including expansions and  satellite terminals, with the total gas send-out capacity of 9 Tcf/year being well  in excess of demand [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#57">57</a>].  From 2020 to 2040, Japan&rsquo;s real GDP increases by an average of 0.5%/year, by  far the lowest in the region, as a result of its declining population and aging  work force. Although Japan&rsquo;s natural gas consumption does not slow between 2020  and 2040, its consumption of energy from liquids and coal does decline. As a  result, the natural gas share of Japan&rsquo;s total energy consumption rises from  25% in 2020 to nearly 30% in 2040.</p>
        <p>South Korea's natural gas consumption grows at average rates  of 2.3%/year from 2012 to 2020 and 1.7%/year from 2020 to 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case. Growth in demand for natural gas in the South Korea's industrial,  residential, and commercial sectors slows, while in the electric power sector it  remains above 2%/year throughout the 2012&#8211;40 period.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have OECD Asia's  strongest average annual growth in electricity sector natural gas consumption  from 2012 to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, averaging 4.6%/year and more  than tripling, from 0.4 Tcf in 2012 to 1.5 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-9). Australia  increases the share of natural gas in its power generation mix to
reduce  its more carbon-intensive coal-fired generation. The two countries' combined  share of OECD Asia&rsquo;s total natural gas use for electricity generation grows  from 10% in 2012 to 21% in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case.</p>

     <h2>Non-OECD natural gas consumption</h2>
     <h4>Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia</h4>
<p>The countries of non-OECD Europe and Eurasia  relied on natural gas for 47% of their primary energy needs in 2012&mdash;the second  highest of any country grouping in IEO2016, after the Middle East. Non-OECD  Europe and Eurasia consumed a total of 23.0 Tcf of natural gas in 2012, the  most outside the OECD and more than any other region in the world except the  OECD Americas. Russia&rsquo;s 15.7 Tcf of natural gas consumption in 2012 accounted  for 68% of the Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia region&rsquo;s total (Figure 3-10).</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-10.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-10.png" alt="Figure 3-10. Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia natural gas consumption, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-10_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>In  the IEO2016 Reference case, overall natural gas consumption in non-OECD Europe  and Eurasia grows by an average of 0.4%/year from 2012 to 2040, including a  decline of 0.3%/year from 2012 to 2020 and an increase of 0.7%/year from 2020  to 2040, for a total increase of 2.9 Tcf over the 2012&#8211;40 period. With Russia  accounting for only about 10% of the region&rsquo;s total increase, the average  increase for the rest of the non-OECD Europe and Eurasia region is 1.1%/year, compared with Russia's average of 0.1%/year. In the electric  power sector, natural gas consumption falls by an average of 0.1%/year from  2012 to 2040 in Russia as growth in its overall energy use slows but grows by  an average of 1.4%/year in the region&rsquo;s other countries.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Asia</h4>
<p>Among all regions of the world, the fastest  growth in natural gas consumption in the IEO2016 Reference case occurs in  non-OECD Asia. Natural gas use in non-OECD Asia increases by an average of 4.4%/year,  from 15.1 Tcf in 2012 to 50.8 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-11). Over the period,  non-OECD Asia accounts for more than 40% of the total incremental growth in  world natural gas use, moving from its current position as the world&rsquo;s  fourth-largest natural gas consuming region to the second-largest natural gas  consuming region in 2030 and the largest consumer in 2040. OECD Asia&rsquo;s total  natural gas consumption increases from less than half that of the OECD Americas  region in 2012 to more than 25% above the OECD Americas total in 2040, and its  share of total world natural gas consumption increases from 13% in 2012 to 25%  in 2040.</p>

<p>China accounts for almost two-thirds (63%) of the growth in non-OECD  Asia's natural gas consumption from 2012 to 2040. Total consumption of natural  gas in China increases by an average of 6.2%/year in the IEO2016 Reference  case, from 5.1 Tcf in 2012 to 27.5 Tcf in 2040. China&rsquo;s central government is  promoting natural gas as a preferred energy source and has set an ambitious  target of increasing the share of natural gas in its overall energy mix to 10%  (or approximately 8.8 Tcf) by 2020 to alleviate pollution from its heavy coal  use [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#58">58</a>].  In the IEO2016 Reference case, natural gas consumption in China totals 9.1 Tcf  in 2020, or about 6% of the country&rsquo;s total energy consumption. In 2040, the  natural gas share of China&rsquo;s energy consumption is 15%&#8212;still less than coal&rsquo;s  44% share. However, the 6.2% average annual growth rate for natural gas  consumption from 2012 to 2040 is far below the 9.7% average growth rate for  nuclear energy.</p>
<p>In India, natural gas accounted for about 8% of total  energy consumption in 2012, almost double the share in China's energy mix. In  other countries of non-OECD Asia, natural gas use accounts for 23% of overall  energy consumption in 2012, and its share rises to 25% in 2040 in the IEO2016  Reference case, as natural gas consumption increases by an average of 2.8%/year,  from 7.9 Tcf in 2012 to 17.2 Tcf in 2040. Although natural gas remains the  second-largest source of energy consumption after liquids, its annual growth rate  is less than the rates for renewables (3.4%) and nuclear energy (2.9%).</p>
<h4>Middle East</h4>
<p>In the Middle East region, natural gas accounted  for almost half of total energy consumption in 2012, more than in any other  region. In the IEO2016 Reference case, Middle East natural gas consumption  increases by an average of 2.5%/year from 2012 to 2040, and the industrial  sector accounts for the largest share of the region&rsquo;s total natural gas  consumption (Figure 3-12). Natural gas use in the industrial sector grows by  7.7 Tcf from 2012 to 2040, accounting for more than half of the 14.2 Tcf total  increase in natural gas consumption. In the electric power sector, natural gas  use grows by 5.2 Tcf from 2012 to 2040, when it totals 9.8 Tcf. Natural  gas-fired generation gains a portion of the market as the use of crude oil for electricity  generation declines.</p>

<h4>Africa</h4>
<p>Africa's natural gas consumption totals 11.1 Tcf  in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, or 2.5 times the 2012 total (Figure 3-13).  The region&rsquo;s natural gas use increases by an average of 3.3%/year from 2012 to  2040, a rate that is second only to the 4.4%/year average increase for nuclear  energy over the same period. Africa's electric power and industrial sectors  account for 79% of the increase in the region's demand for natural gas from  2012 to 2040 and for 84% of its total natural gas demand in 2040. Natural gas  consumption in the electric power sector grows from 2.2 Tcf in 2012 to 5.5 Tcf  in 2040, accounting for 49% of the total increase in Africa&rsquo;s natural gas use  over the period. More than 85% of the increase in natural gas use for  electricity generation in Africa occurs from 2020 to 2040, when it averages  3.6%/year, as compared with an average of less than 2.5%/year from 2012 to  2020.</p>

<h4>Non-OECD Americas</h4>
<p>Natural gas consumption in the non-OECD Americas  region increases by an average of 2.0%/year in the IEO2016 Reference case, from  5.1 Tcf in 2012 to 8.9 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-14). The industrial sector  accounts for more than one-third of the consumption growth from 2012 to 2040,  followed by the electric power sector at approximately one-quarter. Brazil&rsquo;s  natural gas consumption grows by an average of 2.6%/year from 2012 to 2040, or  by a total of 1.1 Tcf&mdash;more than 25% of the overall increase of 3.9 Tcf for the  non-OECD Americas region. The increase from 0.7 Tcf in 2012 to 1.4 Tcf in 2040  in Brazil&rsquo;s industrial sector natural gas consumption accounts for more than  60% of the country&rsquo;s total increase in natural gas use from 2012 to 2040.  Consumption of natural gas in both the industrial and electric power sectors  grows by approximately 2.3%/year from 2012 to 2040, when the industrial sector  accounts for 64% and the electric power sector accounts for 22% of Brazil&rsquo;s total  natural gas consumption.</p>

<h2>World natural gas production</h2>
<p>To meet projected growth in natural gas use in  the IEO2016 Reference case, the world's natural gas supplies increase by nearly  83 Tcf (69%) from 2012 to 2040. Much of the increase in supply is projected to  come from non-OECD countries, which  in the Reference case account for 73% of the total increase in world natural  gas production from 2012 to 2040. Non-OECD natural gas production grows by an  average of 2.1%/year, from 75 Tcf in 2012 to 136 Tcf in 2040 (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/table3-1.cfm">Table 3-1</a>), while  OECD production grows by 1.4%/year, from 44 Tcf to 66 Tcf.</p>
<p>Production from continuous  resources grows rapidly in the projection, with OECD tight gas, shale gas, and  coalbed methane production averaging 3.0%/year, from 20 trillion cubic in 2012  to 47 Tcf in 2040. Over the same period, non-OECD production of tight gas,  shale gas, and coalbed methane grows from nearly 2 Tcf to 34 Tcf. However,  numerous uncertainties could affect future production of those resources. There  is still considerable variation among estimates of recoverable shale gas  resources in the United States and Canada, and estimates of recoverable tight  gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane for the rest of the world are more  uncertain, given the sparse data currently available. Moreover, the hydraulic  fracturing process used to produce shale gas resources often requires  significant amounts of water, and available water supplies are limited in many  of the world regions that have been identified as possessing shale gas  resources. Further environmental concerns can also add to the uncertainty  surrounding access to shale gas resources.</p>
<h4>OECD production</h4>
<h5>OECD Americas</h5>
<p>Natural gas production in the OECD Americas  grows by 49% from 2012 to 2040. The United States, which is the largest  producer in the OECD Americas and in the OECD as a whole, accounts for more  than two-thirds of the region's total production growth from 24 Tcf in 2012 to  35 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-15). U.S. shale gas production grows from 10 Tcf in  2012 to 20 Tcf in 2040, more than offsetting declines in production of natural  gas from other sources. In 2040, shale gas accounts for 55% of total U.S.  natural gas production in the IEO2016 Reference case, tight gas accounts for  20%, and offshore  production from the Lower 48 states accounts for 8%. The remaining 17% comes  from coalbed methane, Alaska, and other associated and nonassociated onshore  resources in the Lower 48 states.</p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-15.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-15.png" alt="Figure 3-15. OECD natural gas production by country and region, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-15_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Natural gas production in Canada grows by 1.2%/year on  average over the projection period, from 6.1 Tcf in 2012 to 8.6 Tcf in 2040. In  Canada, like in the United States, much of the production growth comes from  growing volumes of tight gas and shale gas production.</p>
<p>Mexico's natural gas production is relatively flat in the  midterm, but it more than doubles in the later years of the projection, as production  from shale gas resources grows, supported by the country's recent energy reforms.  Total natural gas production in Mexico increases from 1.7 Tcf in 2012 to 3.3  Tcf in 2040. Like Canada and the United States, Mexico is thought to have  substantial shale gas resources, the most prospective of which are extensions  of the successful Eagle Ford Shale in the United States. However, because the  shale resources in Mexico have not been explored as fully as those in the rest  of North America, there is more uncertainty surrounding estimates of their size  and potential for production.</p>
<h4>OECD Europe</h4>
<p>Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom  are the three largest producers of natural gas in OECD Europe, accounting for more  than 80% of the region's total natural gas production in 2012. In the IEO2016  Reference case, OECD Europe&rsquo;s natural gas production declines in the mid-term  and then begins to grow again in the later part of the projection, as  production from tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane resources becomes  more significant (Figure 3-16). Overall, natural gas production in OECD Europe  in 2040 is 1.6 Tcf higher than in 2012. Contributing to OECD Europe's total production  is the growth in natural gas production from Israel, which became an OECD  member country in September 2010 and is included in OECD Europe for statistical  reporting purposes.</p>

      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-16_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<h4>OECD Asia</h4>
<p>Natural gas production in the Australia/New Zealand region increases  from 2.1 Tcf in 2012 to 7.0 Tcf in 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case, at an  average rate of 4.4%/year. In 2012, more than 90% of production in the  Australia/New Zealand region came from Australia, with production in Western  Australia (including the Northwest Shelf area of Australia's Carnarvon Basin)  accounting for approximately 58% of the country&rsquo;s total production [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#59">59</a>].  Much of Australia's production is used as feedstock at the Northwest Shelf LNG  liquefaction facility. Similarly, many of Australia&rsquo;s new natural gas field  developments are tied to liquefaction projects that have several export  contracts in place.</p>
  <p>Both Japan and South Korea have limited natural gas  resources. Consequently, they have limited current production and limited  prospects for future production. Both countries receive most of their natural  gas supplies in the form of imported LNG. In 2012, natural gas production in Japan  accounted for only 3% of the country's natural gas consumption, and in South  Korea domestic natural gas production accounted for less than 1% of natural gas  consumption. Although substantial deposits of methane hydrates in both Japan  and South Korea have been confirmed, both countries are investigating how those  resources could be safely and economically developed. The IEO2016 Reference  case does not include methane hydrate resources in its estimates of natural gas  resources, and widespread development of hydrates on a commercial scale is not  anticipated during the projection period.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD production</h4>
<h4>Middle East</h4>
<p>The three largest natural gas producers in the  Middle East&mdash;Iran, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia&mdash;together accounted for 76% of the natural  gas produced in the Middle East in 2012. With more than 40% of the world&rsquo;s  proved natural gas reserves, the Middle East accounts for 20% of the total  increase in world natural gas production in the IEO2016 Reference case, from  19.2 Tcf in 2012 to 35.8 Tcf in 2040 (Figure 3-17).</p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-17.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-17.png" alt="Figure 3-17. Middle East natural gas production by country, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-17_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
      
<p>The strongest growth among Middle East producers from 2012  to 2040 in the IEO2016 Reference case comes from Iran, where natural gas production  increases by 6.8 Tcf, followed by Saudi Arabia (3.4 Tcf of new production) and  Qatar (2.9 Tcf). Although Iraq is the region&rsquo;s fastest-growing supplier of  natural gas, with average increases of 15%/year over the projection period, it  remains a relatively minor contributor to regional natural gas supplies. In  2040, Iraq&rsquo;s natural gas production totals 1.0 Tcf, or about 3% of the Middle  East total.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia</h4>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, 15% of the global  increase in natural gas production comes from non-OECD Europe and Eurasia,  which includes Russia, Central Asia, and non-OECD Europe. In the region as a  whole, natural gas production increases from 28.5 Tcf in 2012 to 40.9 Tcf in  2040 (Figure 3-18). Russia remains the largest natural gas producer, accounting  for more than 75% of the region&rsquo;s total production over the projection period.  In the IEO2016 Reference case, Russia&rsquo;s natural gas production grows on average  by 1.4%/year from 2012 to 2040, supported primarily by growth in exports to  both Europe and Asia.</p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-18.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-18.png" alt="Figure 3-18. Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia natural gas production, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-18_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Natural gas production in Central Asia, which includes the  former Soviet Republics, grows by 0.9%/year on average, from 5.5 Tcf in 2012 to  7.1 Tcf in 2040. Much of the projected growth is in Turkmenistan, which already  is a major natural gas producer, accounting for 44% of the region&rsquo;s total  production in 2012. Also contributing to Central Asia's production growth is  Azerbaijan. Almost all of Azerbaijan's natural gas is produced in two offshore  fields&#8212;the Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli (ACG) complex and Shah Deniz. The  second phase of Shah Deniz development is expected to start producing in 2018, with  a peak capacity of 565 Bcf per year (in addition to the 315 Bcf in Phase I),  according to BP, the development operator [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#60">60</a>].  When it is completed, Shah Deniz will be one of the largest natural gas  development projects in the world.</p>
<h4>Africa</h4>
<p>Natural gas production in Africa grows in the  IEO2016 Reference case from 7.6 Tcf in 2012 to 9.8 Tcf in 2020 and 16.5 Tcf in  2040 (Figure 3-19). In 2012, about three-quarters of Africa&rsquo;s natural gas was  produced in North Africa, mainly in Algeria, Egypt, and Libya. West Africa (with  Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea providing virtually all of West Africa&rsquo;s  production) accounted for another 23% of the 2012 total, and the rest of Africa  accounted for 3%. Remaining resources in West Africa are more promising than those  in North Africa, which has been producing large volumes of natural gas over a  much longer period. Accordingly, in the IEO2016 Reference case, production  growth in West Africa is higher than in North Africa, with annual increases  over the projection period averaging 5.6%/year and 1.1%/year, respectively.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-19.png" class="lightbox"><img src="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/images/figure_3-19.png" alt="Figure 3-19. Africa natural gas production by region, 2012&#8211;40" width="322" /></a><br /> 
      <span class="caption"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/excel/figure3-19_data.xls" class="ico_xls">figure  data</a></span></span></p>
<p>Nigeria  is the largest natural gas producer in West Africa, although there also have  been recent production increases in Equatorial Guinea, which brought an LNG  liquefaction facility online in 2007. Angola was expected to add to West Africa's  production in the near term with the startup of its first LNG liquefaction  facility in 2013. However, in April 2014, Angola LNG temporarily shut down the  plant because of ongoing technical issues, which led to infrequent exports  while it was open. Technical issues at the plant included electrical fires,  pipeline leaks and ruptures, and a collapsed drilling rig. Recommissioning of  the Angola LNG plant began in January 2016 and operator Chevron expects the  first LNG shipment to occur in the second quarter of 2016 [<a href="http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/footnotes.cfm#61">61</a>].</p>
<p>In Nigeria, security concerns and uncertainty over terms of  access have delayed proposed export projects and limited mid-term production  growth. In the IEO2016 Reference case, export projects in Nigeria regain their  former momentum later in the projection period, raising production for the West  Africa region from 1.7 Tcf in 2012 to 7.9 Tcf in 2040. West Africa's share of the  continent's total natural gas production more than doubles in the IEO2016  Reference case, from 23% in 2012 to 48% in 2040.</p>
<h4>Non-OECD Asia</h4>
<p>In the IEO2016 Reference case, natural gas  production in non-OECD Asia more than doubles from 2012 to 2040, increasing by  18.7 T
